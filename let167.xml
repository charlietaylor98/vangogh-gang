    <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
    <body><p>I’m enclosing a word or two because they’re writing to you, for I thought you’d like to hear
        from me as well once in a while about what I’m actually doing.</p>
    <p>If it isn’t raining, I go outdoors every day, usually on the heath.</p>
    <p>I’m making my studies quite large, like a few you saw here during your visit.</p>
    <p><work origin="new" completion="sketch">So I’ve done, among other things, a hut on Het
            Heike</work> and also <work origin="new" completion="sketch">that barn with a
            moss-covered roof in Roosendaalseweg</work>, which here they call the Protestant barn.
        Perhaps you’ll recall what I mean.</p>
    <p><work origin="new" completion="sketch">Then the mill nearby, in the meadow
        opposite,</work>and <work origin="new" completion="sketch">the elm trees in the
            cemetery</work>.</p>
    <p>And also <work origin="new" completion="sketch">one with woodcutters working in a wide open
            space where a large pine-wood has been cut down</work>. I’m also trying to draw the
        implements, such as a cart, plough, harrow, wheelbarrow &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
    <p>The one with the woodcutters turned out the best, and I think it would please you.</p>
    <p>
        <unstress reason="friendship">Perhaps Rappard will be coming here for a while this summer,
            I’ve had a letter from him.</unstress>
    </p></body>
    <p>In thought a handshake, and believe me</p>
    <close>Ever yours,</close>
