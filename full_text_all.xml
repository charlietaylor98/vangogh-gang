            <salutation> My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Thanks for your letter, I was glad to hear that you got back safely. I missed you
                    the first few days, and it was strange for me not to find you when I came home
                    in the afternoon.<unstress reason="family"> We spent some pleasant days
                        together</unstress>, and actually did go for some walks and see a thing or
                    two whenever we had the chance.</p>
                <p>What terrible weather, you must feel anxious on your walks to Oisterwijk.
                    Yesterday there were trotting races on the occasion of the exhibition, but the
                    illumination and fireworks were postponed because of the bad weather, so it’s
                    just as well you didn’t stay to see them. Regards from the Haanebeeks and the
                    Rooses.</p>

            <body>
                <p>That was good news that I just read in Pa’s letter. My hearty congratulations. I
                    don’t doubt that it will give you pleasure, it’s such a fine firm. It will be a
                    big change for you. <unstress reason="career">I’m so glad that both of us are
                        now in the same line of business</unstress>, and in the same firm; we must
                    correspond often. </p>

                <p>I hope so much to see you before you leave, we’ll have a lot to talk about. I
                    believe that <unstress reason="environment">Brussels is a very pleasant
                        city</unstress>, though it will seem strange at first. At all events, write
                    to me soon. And now adieu, these are only a few words written in haste, but I
                    just had to tell you <unstress reason="environment">how very glad I
                        was</unstress>. I wish you well, and believe me ever,</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>It’s good that you answered me so quickly. <good_health>I’m glad that things are
                        to your liking</good_health> and that you’ve been lucky with your
                    boarding-house. Be of good heart if things sometimes get difficult, everything
                    will come right later on, and no one can do what he really wants in the
                    beginning. How sorry I am about Uncle Hein. I sincerely hope he’ll get better,
                    but Theo, I fear he won’t. Last summer he was still so full of ambition, and had
                    so many plans and told me that business was going so well. <stress
                        reason="family">It is indeed sad</stress>.</p>
                <p> Last Sunday <unstress reason="family">I was at Uncle Cor’s and had a very
                        pleasant day there</unstress> and, as you can well imagine, saw many
                    beautiful things. As you know, Uncle has just been to Paris and has brought home
                    splendid paintings and drawings. I stayed in Amsterdam on Monday morning and
                    went to the museums again. Did you know that a large, new building will take the
                    place of the Trippenhuis in Amsterdam? That’s fine with me; the Trippenhuis is
                    too small, and many paintings hang in such a way that one can’t see them
                    properly. </p>
                <p>How I’d like to see that painting by Cluysenaar. I’ve seen only a few of his
                    paintings, and those I find very beautiful. Write and tell me whether that other
                    painting is by Alfred Stevens, or otherwise what his Christian name is. I know
                    the photo of the Rotta, and even saw the painting at the Brussels exhibition. Do
                    keep me constantly informed about whatever you see, that always gives me
                    pleasure. The album whose title you gave me isn’t the one I meant, which
                    contains only lithographs after Corot. Thanks anyway for taking the trouble. I
                    expect a letter from Anna soon. She’s rather lazy about writing these days. You
                    ought to surprise her with a letter sometime, that would give her so much
                    pleasure. You must be very busy, but that’s a good thing. </p>
                <p>It’s cold here, and people are already skating on the flooded fields. I go
                    walking as much as I can. I’m curious to know whether you’ll find an opportunity
                    to go skating. Herewith my portrait, but don’t say anything about it when you
                    write home. As you know, it’s for Pa’s birthday, on which I congratulate you
                    ahead of the event. My warm regards to Uncle and Aunt, also to Mr Schmidt and
                    Eduard.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>It’s time you heard from me again, and I’m also longing to hear how you are and
                    how Uncle Hein is doing, so I hope you’ll write to me when you can find the
                    time. You’ll have heard that I’m going to London, and probably very soon. I do
                    hope we’ll be able to see each other before then. I’ll go to Helvoirt at Easter
                    if I possibly can, but it will depend on the nouveautés that Iterson takes along
                    on his trip. I won’t be able to leave until he gets back.</p>
                <p>Life in L. will be very different for me, for I’ll probably have to live alone in
                    lodgings, and will<stress reason="environment">therefore have to deal with many
                        things that I needn’t trouble myself with now</stress>. I’m looking forward
                    to seeing L. very much, as you can imagine, and yet I’m sorry to have to leave
                    this place. I’m only just noticing how attached I am to The Hague, now that it’s
                    been decided I must go away. Still, it can’t be helped, and I intend not to take
                    things too hard. I think it’s wonderful for my English, which I understand well,
                    though I don’t speak it nearly as well as I’d like. </p>
                <p>I heard from Anna that you had your portrait taken. If you can spare another, I
                    commend myself. How is Uncle Hein? Certainly no better, and how is Aunt doing?
                    Can Uncle keep himself occupied, and is he in a lot of pain? Give them my warm
                    regards, I think of them so often. </p>
                <p>How is business with you? It must be busy, as it is here. You probably know your
                    way around by now. How is your boarding-house? Is it still to your liking?
                    That’s important. Above all, you must write more about the kind of things you
                    see. Sunday a fortnight ago I was in Amsterdam to see an exhibition of the
                    paintings going to Vienna from here. It was very interesting, and I’m curious as
                    to the impression the Dutch will make in Vienna. I’m very curious about the
                    English painters, we see so little of them, because almost everything stays in
                    England. Goupil has no gallery in London; they only supply the trade.</p>
                <p>Uncle Cent is coming here at the end of the month, I’m longing to hear more from
                    him. The Haanebeeks and Aunt Fie ask after you constantly, and send you their
                    regards. What <unstress reason="environment">wonderful weather we’ve been
                        having</unstress>, I’m taking advantage of it as much as I can. Last Sunday
                    I went rowing with Willem. How much I’d have liked to stay here this summer, but
                    we must take things as they come. And now, adieu, I wish you well, and write to
                    me. Bid good-day to Uncle and Aunt, Schmidt and Eduard from me. As to Easter,
                    I’m just hoping. Ever, </p>

            <ps>
                <p>Mr and Mrs Roos and Willem also send you their regards. I just received your
                    letter, for which I thank you. I’m very pleased with the portrait, it turned out
                    well. If I hear anything more about my trip to Helvoirt I’ll write to you
                    immediately. It would be nice if we could arrive on the same day. Adieu. Theo, I
                    must again recommend that you start smoking a pipe. It does you a lot of good
                    when you’re out of spirits, as I quite often am nowadays.</p>

            <body>
                <p>Would you mind checking whether a painting by Schotel is still in Brussels? It
                    was sent from here on consignment on 6 May 1870, but perhaps Uncle has already
                    sent it back to Paris. If that isn’t the case, however, see that it’s sent here
                    immediately. We have every chance of selling it, but time is of the essence. I
                    saw it last summer in your gallery, and imagine it’s probably still there.</p>
                <p>Bid good-day to Uncle and Aunt and Mr Schmidt and Eduard for me. You’ll have
                    received my letter by now.</p>

                <p>You mustn’t take it amiss, old chap, that I didn’t remember your birthday. Many
                    congratulations; I hope that things will continue to go well for you this year,
                    and that you’ll take more and more pleasure in your work. </p>
                <p>My time is drawing to a close. On Saturday I’ll go home and take my leave, and
                    then on Sunday on to Paris. I’m afraid it’ll end up being Monday, however, and
                    that on Sunday I’ll still be in Helvoirt. I hope I’ll be able to write to you in
                    time about when I’ll be passing through Brussels, but it’s quite possible that I
                    won’t be able to, as I don’t yet know for sure when I have to be in Paris at the
                    latest. </p>
                <p>How are Uncle and Aunt? Have they moved yet? Be sure to write to me soon about
                    that, I’ll give you my address below. <stress reason="career">I’m writing in

                    I forget, yesterday I showed your portrait to Mrs Tersteeg, and she would like
                    very much to have one. Would you have a chance to get another one and send it to

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>You’re probably longing to hear from me, so I don’t want to keep you waiting for
                    a letter any longer. I heard from home that you’re now staying with Mr Schmidt,
                    and that Pa has been to see you. I sincerely hope that this will be more to your
                    liking than your previous boarding-house, and don’t doubt that it will be. Write
                    to me soon, I’m longing to hear from you, and tell me how you’re spending your
                    days at present, &amp;c. Write to me especially about the paintings you’ve seen
                    recently, and also whether anything new has been published in the way of
                    etchings or lithographs. You must keep me well informed about this, because here
                    I don’t see much in that genre, as the firm here is just a stockroom. I’m very
                    well, considering the circumstances.</p>
                <p>I’ve come by a boarding-house that suits me very well for the present. There are
                    also three Germans in the house who really love music and <unstress
                        reason="environment">play piano and sing themselves, which makes the
                        evenings very pleasant indeed</unstress>. <unstress reason="career">I’m not
                        as busy here as I was in The Hague</unstress>, as I only have to be in the
                    office from 9 in the morning until 6 in the evening, and on Saturdays I’m
                    finished by 4 o’clock. I live in one of the suburbs of London, where it’s
                    comparatively quiet. It’s a bit like Tilburg or some such place.<unstress
                        reason="environment"> I spent some very pleasant days in Paris and, as you
                        can imagine, very much enjoyed all the beautiful things I saw at the
                        exhibition and in the Louvre and the Luxembourg</unstress>. The Paris branch
                    is splendid, and much larger than I’d imagined. Especially the Place de l’Opéra.
                    Life here is very expensive. I pay 18 shillings a week for my lodgings, not
                    including the washing, and then I still have to eat in town.</p>
                <p>Last Sunday I went on an outing with Mr Obach, my superior, to Box Hill, which is
                    a high hill (some 6 hours from L.), partly of chalk and covered with box trees,
                    and on one side a wood of tall oak trees. <unstress reason="environment">The
                        countryside here is magnificent, completely different from Holland or
                        Belgium. Everywhere one sees splendid parks with tall trees and shrubs,
                        where one is allowed to walk.</unstress> During the Whitsun holiday
                        <unstress reason="environment">I also took a nice trip</unstress> with those
                    Germans, but those gentlemen spend a great deal of money and I shan’t go out
                    with them any more. <good_health>I was glad to hear from Pa that Uncle H. is
                        reasonably well</good_health>. Would you give my warm regards to him and
                    Aunt and give them news of me? Bid good-day to Mr Schmidt and Eduard from me,
                    and write to me soon. </p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Thanks for your letter, <good_health>which gave me a great deal of
                        pleasure</good_health>. I’m glad you’re well and that living at Mr Schmidt’s
                    is still to your liking. Mr Obach was pleased to make your acquaintance. I hope
                    that in future we’ll do a lot of business with you. That painting by Linder is
                    very beautiful. As to the photogravure, I know more or less how they’re made,
                    though I haven’t seen it, and it isn’t clear enough to me to explain it.</p>
                <p>English art didn’t appeal to me much at first, one has to get used to it. There
                    are some good painters here, though, including Millais, who made ‘The Huguenot’,
                    Ophelia, &amp;c., engravings of which you probably know, they’re very beautiful.
                    Then Boughton, of whom you know the ‘Puritans going to church’ in our Galerie
                    photographique. I’ve seen very beautiful things by him. Moreover, among the old
                    painters, Constable, a landscape painter who lived around 30 years ago, whose
                    work is splendid, something like Diaz and Daubigny. And Reynolds and
                    Gainsborough, who mostly painted very, very beautiful portraits of women, and
                    then Turner, after whom you’ll probably have seen engravings. Several good
                    French painters live here, including Tissot, after whom there are various photos
                    in our Galerie photographique, Otto Weber and Heilbuth. The latter is currently
                    making dazzlingly beautiful paintings in the style of the one by Linder. Be
                    sure, when you get the chance, to write and tell me whether there are
                    photographs after Wauters, besides Hugo van der Goes and Mary of Burgundy, and
                    whether you also know photographs of paintings by Lagye and De Braekeleer.</p>
                <p> It’s not the elder De Braekeleer I mean but, I believe, a son of his, who had 3
                    splendid paintings at the last exhibition in Brussels, titled ‘Antwerp’, ‘The
                    school’ and ‘The atlas’. <good_health>Things are going well for me
                        here.</good_health> I go walking a lot. Here where I live it’s a quiet,
                    convivial, nice-looking neighbourhood, in this I’ve really been fortunate. And
                    yet I sometimes think back with nostalgia to the wonderful Sundays in
                    Scheveningen and so on, but never mind that. You’ll surely have heard that Anna
                    is at home and not well. It’s a bad start to her holiday, but let’s hope she’s
                    better by now. Thanks for what you wrote to me about paintings. Be sure to write
                    and tell me if you ever see anything by Lagye, De Braekeleer, Wauters, Maris,
                    Tissot, George Saal, Jundt, Ziem, Mauve, who are painters I like very much, and
                    by whom you’ll probably see something now and then.</p>
                <p>Herewith a copy of that poem about that painter ‘who entered The Swan, the inn
                    where he boarded’, which you no doubt remember. It’s Brabant to a T, and I’m so
                    fond of it. Lies copied it out for me on my last evening at home. How much I’d
                    like to have you here, what pleasant days we spent together in The Hague. I
                    still think so often of our walk on Rijswijkseweg, where we drank milk at the
                    mill after the rain. If those paintings we have from you are to be sent back,
                    I’ll send you a portrait of that mill by Weissenbruch. Perhaps you remember,
                    ‘the merry tune’ is his nickname, ‘I say, superrrb’. That Rijswijkseweg holds
                    memories for me which are perhaps the most delightful I have. Perhaps we’ll
                    speak of it again sometime when we meet.</p>
            </body>
            <close>And now, old chap, I wish you well, think of me from time to time and write to me
                soon. It’s so refreshing when I receive a letter. </close>
            <sig>Vincent</sig>

            <ps>
                <p>My regards to Mr Schmidt and Eduard. How are Uncle Hein and Aunt? Write to me
                    about them, do you go there often? Give them my warm regards. </p>


                <p>The evening hour. </p>
                <p>Slowly the toll of the angelus-bell resounded o’er the fields, As they blissfully
                    bathed in the gold of the evening sun. O solemn, moving moment! When every
                    mother in the village suddenly Stops the whirring of the wheel to bless herself
                    with the sign of the cross; </p>
                <p>While in the field the farmer reins in his steaming horses, And, behind the
                    plough, bares his head to murmur an Ave. O solemn, moving moment! When the bell
                    that proclaims far and wide The end of the day’s work makes those powerful,
                    dripping heads Bow down for Him who causes the sweat in the furrow to thrive. </p>
                <p>For the artist, too, on the slope of yon shady hill, Absorbed in his painting
                    from the earliest morning, The angelus now gave the sign to retreat. Slowly he
                    wiped His brush and palette, which he stowed with his canvas in the valise,
                    Folded his camp-stool and dreamily descended the path That leads, gently
                    winding, through the flowery dale to the village. </p>
                <p>Yet how oft, before reaching the foot of the hill, did he Stand admiringly still,
                    to imprint on his mind once again The refreshing scene down below, unfolding
                    before his eyes.</p>

                <p>Just before him lay the village, with a hill to north and to south, Between whose
                    crests the sun, inflamed and sinking in the west, Let flow the whole wealth of
                    its colours and up-conjured glory. The bell, in the grey tower entwined with
                    black-green ivy, Was now silent. Hanging motionless on high were the brown Sails
                    of the windmill; the leaves stood still and above the huts Blue clouds of
                    peat-smoke ascended so straight from the chimneys That they, too, seemed to hang
                    motionless in the shimmering air.</p>

                <p>’Twas as though this village, this field, those hills, as though everything,
                    Before wrapping itself in a cloak of evening dew to sleep Beneath the sun’s
                    parting kiss, silently and gratefully Recalled once more the peace and plenty it
                    had again savoured. </p>

                <p>Soon, though, this silence was gently disturbed by the sweet sounds Of the
                    evening. In the distance, from a hollow in the hill echoed Lingeringly the sound
                    of the cow-horn, calling the cattle. And at this sign from their herdsman there
                    soon appeared in the furrowed Sandy mountain road the whole of a colourful herd
                    of cows. Cracking and smacking, the lad’s lash drove them forward, While they,
                    as if by turns, their necks outstretched, with friendly lowing Greeted from afar
                    the cow-shed where the milkmaid Waited for them each evening to ease their taut
                    udders. Thus on the paths running out from the village like spokes From an axle,
                    there slowly came movement and life. Here, ’twas a farmer, dragging homeward a
                    harrow or plough On a sledge, whistling a tune and riding beside on his bay; </p>
                <p> There, a blushing lass, on her head a lock of sweet clover Laced with daisies
                    and poppies, called from afar to the others, Kindly and gaily at once, her
                    clear-toned ‘good evening’. Further... But on the same track where the painter’s
                    path Led, he suddenly heard peals of joyous laughter. Rocking from side to side,
                    a wagon, nearly toppling Under its load of fresh-harvested buckwheat, came
                    rumbling closer, Both horse and burden adorned with fluttering ribbons and
                    greenery. Children, all with wreaths of flowers on their little flaxen heads,
                    Were seated on top, happily waving branches of alder, Or scattering flowers and
                    leaves, which rained down on all sides, While round the wagon a troop of country
                    lads and lasses Skipped and sang enough to startle the whole drowsy plain.</p>

                <p>Quietly smiling, the Painter, from behind the thicket, Watched as the revellers
                    slowly wound their way down the rutted road. ‘Aye’, he thus mumbled, ‘Aye, the
                    Lord must think it A happy sound, the jubilance with which these hearts So
                    simply pour forth their thanks as they gather the last Fruits, which He yearly
                    lets grow fully ripe from their toil. Yea, for the purest prayer of simplicity
                    and innocence is joy!’</p>

                <p>And thus contemplating the calm, deep delight upon which the soul Feasts in the
                    fields; or with his artist’s mind reconstructing In silent rapture the glorious
                    scene of a moment ago, He found he had sauntered, unnoticing, into the
                    village.</p>

                <p>Already the purple and yellow had faded to grey in the west, And in the east
                    there had risen close by the little church the full Copper-coloured disc of the
                    moon, in mist enshrouded, When he entered The Swan, the inn where he
                    boarded.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Thanks for writing. I sincerely wish you a very happy New Year. I know that
                    things are going well for you in the office, because I heard as much from Mr
                    Tersteeg. I saw from your letter that you have art in your blood, and that’s a
                    good thing, old chap. I’m glad you like Millet, Jacque, Schreyer, Lambinet,
                    Frans Hals &amp;c., because – as Mauve says – ‘that’s it’. Yes, that painting by
                    Millet ‘The evening angelus’, ‘that’s it’. That’s rich, that’s poetry. How I’d
                    like to talk to you about art again, but now we can only write to each other
                    about it often; find things beautiful as much as you can, most people find too
                    little beautiful.</p>
                <p>I’m writing below a few names of painters whom I like very much indeed. Scheffer,
                    Delaroche, Hébert, Hamon. Leys, Tissot, Lagye, Boughton, Millais, Thijs Maris,
                    Degroux, De Braekeleer Jr.</p>
                <p> Millet, Jules Breton, Feyen-Perrin, Eugène Feyen, Brion, Jundt, George Saal.
                    Israëls, Anker, Knaus, Vautier, Jourdan, Jalabert, Antigna, Compte-Calix,
                    Rochussen, Meissonier, Zamacois, Madrazo, Ziem, Boudin, Gérôme, Fromentin, De
                    Tournemine, Pasini. </p>
                <p> Decamps, Bonington, Diaz, T. Rousseau, Troyon, Dupré, Paul Huet, Corot,
                    Schreyer, Jacque, Otto Weber, Daubigny, Wahlberg, Bernier, Emile Breton, Chenu,
                    César de Cock, Mlle Collart. Bodmer, Koekkoek, Schelfhout, Weissenbruch, and
                    last but not least Maris and Mauve. </p>
                <p>But I could go on like this for I don’t know how long, and then come all the old
                    ones, and I’m sure I’ve left out some of the best new ones. Always continue
                    walking a lot and loving nature, for that’s the real way to learn to understand
                    art better and better. Painters understand nature and love it, and teach us to
                    see. And then, there are painters who make nothing but good things, who cannot
                    make anything bad, just as there are ordinary people who cannot do anything that
                    isn’t good.</p>
                <p>
                    <good_health>Things are going well for me here</good_health>, <unstress

                        me to observe London and the English way of life and the English themselves,
                        and I also have nature and art and poetry</unstress>, and if that isn’t
                    enough, what is? Yet I haven’t forgotten Holland, and especially The Hague and
                    Brabant. We’re busy in the office, we’re occupied with the inventory, which is
                    however drawn up in 5 days, so we have it a little easier than you do in The
                    Hague. I hope you had a nice Christmas, <unstress reason="environment">just as I
                        did</unstress>. Well, old chap, I wish you well and write to me soon; in
                    this letter I’ve written just what popped into my pen, I hope you’ll be able to
                    understand it.</p>

            <body>
                <p>In a letter from Pa and Ma I got a guilder from you to buy a pair of cuff links.
                    Many thanks, old chap, but you shouldn’t have done it, you need your money more
                    than I do. Thanks for your letter of this morning. I was very glad to hear that
                    Mauve is engaged to Jet C. That’s wonderful.<good_health> I’m glad</good_health>
                    that you’re so well. It’s good that you’ve read the book by Bürger; read about
                    art as much as possible, especially the Gazette des Beaux-Arts &amp;c. </p>

                <p>Above all, be sure to find out as much as possible about paintings. The Apol that
                    we have here now is very beautiful, last year he painted a similar subject and I
                    found it better and fresher than this one. I’m glad that you go to Uncle Cor’s
                    occasionally. You see things there that you never find at the gallery in The
                    Hague. I’m also busy at present and am <good_health>glad of it</good_health>,
                    because <unstress reason="career">that’s what I need</unstress>. Adieu, old

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Many happy returns of the day. Do right and don’t look back, and things will turn
                    out well. I was glad to get your last letter. I sent you a photo a couple of
                    days ago:</p>

                <p>Young girl with a sword, Jacquet </p>
                <p>because I thought you’d like to have it. Van Gorkom’s painting isn’t very dirty.
                    (Between you and me, I didn’t see it, but anyway tell him I wrote that it wasn’t
                    very dirty.) How are Mauve and Jet Carbentus? Write to me with news of them.
                    It’s good that you visit the Haanebeeks.</p>
                <p>If I come to Holland, I’ll also come to The Hague for a day or two if possible,
                    because The Hague is like a second home to me. (I’ll come and stay with you.)
                    I’d have liked to go on that walk to De Vink. I walk here as much as I can, but
                    I’m very busy. It’s absolutely beautiful here (even though it’s in the city).
                    There are lilacs and hawthorns and laburnums &amp;c. blossoming in all the
                    gardens, and the chestnut trees are magnificent. If one truly loves nature one
                    finds beauty everywhere. Yet I sometimes yearn so much for Holland, and
                    especially Helvoirt. I’m doing a lot of gardening and have sown sweet peas,
                    poppies and reseda, now we just have to wait and see what comes of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="environment">I enjoy the walk from home to the
                        office</unstress> and in the evening from the office back home. It takes
                    about three-quarters of an hour. It’s wonderful to be finished so early here; we
                    close at 6 o’clock and <unstress reason="environment">yet we work none the less
                        because of it</unstress>. Give my regards to everyone I know at the
                    Tersteegs’, Haanebeeks’ and Carbentuses’, and especially the Rooses’, also
                    everyone at Uncle Pompe’s, because they’re going to Kampen, and Mr Bakhuyzen

            <salutation>My dear Theo, </salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Thanks for your letter. I think I’ll be leaving here on Thursday, 25 or Saturday,
                    27 June, if nothing unforeseen happens. I’m longing so much to see everyone and
                    Holland. I’m also looking forward to having a good talk with you about art,
                    start thinking about any questions you might want to put to me. We have many
                    beautiful things here, including a spirited painting by Jacquet, and a beautiful
                    Boldini.</p>

                <p>There are beautiful things at the Royal Academy this year; among others Tissot
                    has 3 paintings. I’ve been drawing again recently, but <work origin="new"
                        stage="sketch">it</work> was nothing special. <unstress reason="family">I
                        was glad</unstress> to see in your letter that you visit the Haanebeeks.
                    Adieu, goodbye for now, give my regards to all my friends.</p>

                <p>I’m glad you like César de Cock so much; he’s one of the few painters to have
                    understood our Brabant intimately enough. I don’t know whether I told you that I
                    met him last year in Paris.</p>

            <body>
                <p>Thanks for the information you got. We’re now staying a day longer and will
                    arrive in London on Wednesday morning.</p>
                <p>I gave you the photo in the Forbes catalogue here already, because I thought it
                    would interest you, being the Scheldt and therefore Belgium. It’s of a painting
                    by Cap. It’s not so very beautiful, but at least it’s original. I’ll write to
                    you soon from London.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Yesterday a crate was sent to The Hague in which I put a photo of a J. Maris and
                    also ‘The landlady’s daughter’ I promised, both of which I hope you’ll hang up
                    in your room. There’s a photo in the same crate of a Thijs Maris for Mr
                    Tersteeg. Schüller at Paris sent me 6 copies of both, which I needed in order to
                    give away. I can’t spare another of the Thijs Maris. Anna and I arrived in
                    London safe and sound, and will manage here somehow. </p>

                <p>I’m not saying that we’ll find something quickly, but each day that she’s here
                    she learns something, and in any case I believe there’s more chance of her
                    finding something here than in Holland. It’s wonderful for me to walk with her
                    through the streets in the evening; I then<unstress reason="environment"> find
                        everything here just as beautiful as I did when I first arrived</unstress>.
                    I wish you well, old chap, and give my regards to the Rooses, Haanebeeks and
                    Carbentuses if you see any of them. I’m learning to swim.</p>
                <p>Write to me whether you’ve begun reading Michelet and what you think of it. That
                    book was a revelation to me.</p>

            <body>
                <p>I’m glad you’ve been reading Michelet and that you really understand it. A book
                    like that at least teaches one to see that there’s a lot more to love than
                    people usually think. That book was a revelation and immediately a gospel to me. </p>
                <p>‘There is no such thing as an old woman!’ </p>
                <p>(This isn’t to say that there are no old women, but that a woman doesn’t grow old
                    as long as she loves and is loved.) And then a chapter like The longing for
                    autumn, how rich it is. </p>
                <p>That a woman is ‘a completely different being’ from a man, and a being that we do
                    not yet know, or at least only very superficially, as you say, yes, that I
                    certainly believe. And that a woman and a man can become one, that is, one whole
                    and not two halves, that I believe too. Anna is managing well, we go on
                    wonderful walks together. It’s so beautiful here, if only one has a good and a
                    single eye, without many beams in it. But if one has that, then it’s beautiful
                    everywhere.</p>
                <p>Pa isn’t at all better, even though he and Ma say he is. Yesterday we received a
                    letter with all kinds of plans (whether we shouldn’t try this and that), which
                    would be unfeasible and certainly useless, and at the end Pa said yet again that
                    he’d leave it all to us &amp;c. &amp;c. Rather feeble and disagreeable, Theo,
                    and it reminded me so much of Grandfather’s letters,<stress reason="family"> but
                        what can be done about it?</stress> Our dear aunts are staying there now,
                    and are certainly doing a lot of good!</p>
                <p>Things are as they are, and what is a body to do about it, as Young Jochem
                    said.</p>
                <p>Anna and I look at the newspaper faithfully every day and answer the
                    advertisements if there are any. Moreover, we’ve already registered with a
                    Governess agency. So we’re doing what we can. More haste, less speed. It’s good
                    that you go to the Haanebeeks so often; give everyone there my warm regards and
                    give them some news of me.</p>
                <p>That painting by Thijs Maris that Mr Tersteeg bought must be beautiful, I’ve
                    already heard about it, and I myself have already bought and sold one completely
                    in the same genre. My passion for drawing has again vanished here in England,
                    but maybe inspiration will strike again one day. </p>
                <p> I’m reading a lot again.</p>
                <p>We’ll probably be moving on 1 January 1875 to another, larger gallery. Mr Obach
                    is in Paris at the moment, deciding whether or not we’ll take over that gallery.
                    Don’t mention this to anyone for the time being. I wish you well; write to us
                    again soon. Anna takes quite some pleasure in paintings, and has rather a good
                    eye. She already finds Boughton, Maris and Jacquet beautiful, for example, so
                    that’s a start. Between you and me, I think we’ll have trouble finding something
                    for her, everywhere they say she’s too young and they require German as well,
                    but at any rate she certainly has more of a chance here than in Holland.</p>

                <p>‘Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.’ ‘He that is without sin among you,
                    let him first cast a stone at her.’ So stick to your own ideas, and if you doubt
                    the goodness of them, test them against those of him who dared to say ‘I am the
                    truth’, or against those of some humane person, such as Michelet. Purity of soul
                    and impurity of body can go together. You know the Margaret at the fountain by
                    Ary Scheffer; is there a purer being than that girl ‘who loved so much’? ‘Leys
                    is not an imitator, but a kindred spirit’ is a true saying that touched me as
                    well. One could say the same of some of Tissot’s paintings, of his Walk in the
                    snow, Walk on the ramparts, Margaret in church, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>What is the subject of Fagel’s Leys? </p>
                <p>Buy Alphonse Karr’s ‘Voyage autour de mon jardin’ with the money I gave you. Be
                    sure to do it, I want you to read it. Anna and I take a walk every evening; it’s
                    already the beginning of autumn, and that makes nature even more serious and
                    intimate. We’re going to move and will live in a house completely overgrown with
                    ivy; we’ll write to you again soon from there.</p>

                    &amp;c. I’d like so much to have you here, we must make sure that it happens

            <body>
                <p>Bravo Theo – You well understood that girl in Adam Bede. That landscape – in
                    which a dull yellow sandy road leads over the hill to the village, with mud or
                    whitewashed huts with green, moss-covered roofs and here and there a blackthorn,
                    on either side brown heather and bunt and a grey sky, with a narrow white strip
                    above the horizon – is by Michel. Except that the atmosphere is purer and nobler
                    than in Michel.</p>
                <p>Today I’m enclosing that little book for you in the crate to be sent. Also Jesus
                    by Renan and Jeanne d’Arc by Michelet, and also a portrait of Corot, from the
                    London News, which I also have hanging in my room.</p>
                <p>I don’t believe there’s any chance that you’ll be transferred to the London
                    branch for the time being. </p>
                <p>Don’t feel bad because you’re not finding things difficult; I have it easy, too.
                    I believe that life is quite long, and the time when ‘another shall gird thee,
                    and carry thee whither thou wouldest not’ will come of its own accord. Adieu,
                    give my regards to everyone I know.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Thanks for your letter. Didn’t I copy out Meeresstille by Heine in your little
                    book? Some time ago I saw a painting by Thijs Maris that reminded me of it. An
                    old Dutch town with rows of brownish red houses with step-gables and tall
                    flights of steps, grey roofs, and white or yellow doors, window-frames and
                    cornices; canals with ships and a large white drawbridge, a barge with a man at
                    the tiller going under it. The little house of the bridge-keeper, whom one sees
                    through the window, sitting in his office. Some distance away a stone bridge
                    over the canal, with people and a cart with white horses crossing it.</p>
                <p>And everywhere movement, a porter with his wheelbarrow, a man leaning against the
                    railing, gazing into the water, women in black with white caps. The foreground a
                    quay with paving-stones and a black railing.</p>
                <p>In the distance a tower rises above the houses. A greyish white sky over
                    everything. It’s a small painting, upright. The subject is nearly the same as
                    the large J. Maris, Amsterdam, which you perhaps know, only this is talent and
                    the other is genius. I’ve again copied out one or two things for you, which I’ll
                    send when I get the chance. Think of ‘The cliff’ and whether you know of
                    anything else. That Victor Hugo piece is beautiful.</p>
            </body>

                <p>I’m sending you herewith a <work origin="new" stage="finished">small
                        drawing</work>. I made it last Sunday, the morning a daughter (13 years old)
                    of my landlady died. It’s a view of Streatham Common, a large, grass-covered
                    area with oak trees and broom. It had rained in the night, and the ground was
                    soggy here and there and the young spring grass fresh and green. As you see,
                    it’s scribbled on the title page of the ‘Poesies d’Edmond Roche’.</p>
                <p>There are beautiful ones among them, serious and sad, including one that begins
                    and ends</p>

                <p>
                    <bad_health>Sad and alone</bad_health>, I climbed the sad, bare dune, Where the
                    sea keens its ceaseless moaning plaint, The dune where dies the wide unfurling
                    wave, Drab path that winds and winds upon itself again. </p>
                <p>and another, ‘Calais’ </p>
                <p>How I love to see you once again, o my native town, Dear sea nymph seated at the
                    waters’ edge!</p>

                <p>I love the soaring spire of your bell-tower, Lovely in its boldness and its
                    elegance, Its fretted cupola, through which we see the sky. </p>
                <p> You’ll probably be curious about what goes with the etching by Corot and so I’ve
                    copied that out as well. </p>
                <p>The pond to Corot</p>

                <p>We watched the pond, its water leaden, drear, Form crease upon crease slowly in
                    the breeze, And the mud, enfolding in a softened line The prow and black sides
                    of a boat aground; </p>
                <p>The woods’ high crown, leaf by fallen leaf, Lay strewn upon the ground; the sky
                    was filled with mist; We two, in whispers, almost furtively,<stress
                        reason="environment"> Were sadly saying</stress>, ‘Summer’s past: </p>
                <p>These slopes have lost their accustomed grace; No more green foliage, no more
                    golden light Trembling in the trembling water or touching tops with gold!’</p>

                <p>This idyll may yet come before our eyes again, If you would have it so: are you
                    not the master Who re-created it after its first creator’s hand?</p>

            <body>
                <p>Thanks for your last letter. How is the patient? I’d already heard from Pa that
                    she was ill, but I didn’t know that it was as bad as you said. Write to me about
                    this soon, if you will. Yes, old boy, ‘what shall we say?’ C.M. and Mr Tersteeg
                    were here and left again last Saturday. In my opinion they went a little too
                    often to the Crystal Palace and other places that didn’t concern them. It seems
                    to me they could also have come and seen where I lived. You ask about Anna, but
                    we’ll discuss that another time. </p>

                <p>I hope and believe that I’m not what many think me to be at present, we’ll see,
                    we have to give it time; people will probably say the same about you in a couple
                    of years; at least if you continue to be what you are: my brother in two senses
                    of the word. Regards, and my regards to the patient.</p>

            <body>
                <p>Thanks for your letter of this morning. Yesterday I saw the Corot exhibition. It
                    included a painting of the ‘Mount of Olives’; I’m glad he painted that.</p>
                <p>On the right, a group of olive trees, dark against the darkening blue sky; in the
                    background hills covered with shrubs and a couple of tall trees, above them the
                    evening star. There are 3 Corots at the Salon, very beautiful, the most
                    beautiful one, painted shortly before his death, ‘Women cutting wood’, will
                    probably appear as a woodcut in L’Illustration or Le Monde Illustré. I’ve also
                    seen the Louvre and the Luxembourg, as you can imagine.</p>
                <p>The Ruisdaels in the Louvre are magnificent, especially ‘The bush’, ‘The
                    breakwater’ and ‘The ray of sunlight’. I wish you could see the small Rembrandts
                    there, the ‘Supper at Emmaus’, and two pendants, ‘The philosophers’. I recently
                    saw Jules Breton with his wife and two daughters. Physically he reminded me of
                    J. Maris, though he has dark hair. When I have the chance I’ll send you a book
                    of his, ‘Les champs et la mer’, which contains all his poems. He has a beautiful
                    painting at the Salon, ‘The feast of St John’, peasant girls dancing on a summer
                    evening round the St John’s bonfire, in the background the village with its
                    church and the moon above it. </p>
                <p>Dance, young maidens, dance, As you sing your songs of love! Tomorrow, at break
                    of day, You’ll go, hastening to ply your sickles.</p>
                <p> There are now 3 paintings by him in the Luxembourg. ‘Procession through a
                    cornfield’, ‘Women gleaning’ and ‘Alone’.</p>

                <p>You certainly won’t forget her and her death, but keep it to yourself. This is
                    one of those things that, little by little, makes us ‘sorrowful, yet alway

                <p>I’d rather that you were out of The Hague. Don’t you sometimes long for that as
                    well? Write and tell me, yes or no? I’m staying here for the time being, and
                    will probably not go to Holland before the autumn.</p>
                <p>In the first crate going to The Hague you’ll find a package for Helvoirt. Please
                    send it on after looking at what’s inside. There are a few lithographs &amp;c.
                    which I’d like to see in Pa’s study with the ‘Funeral in the cornfield’ by Van
                    der Maaten. Anker’s painting of ‘An old Huguenot’, a photo of which is in the
                    package in question, I sold to Uncle Vincent, who was here a couple of days ago.
                    He also bought a beautiful painting by Jacque, horses pulling a plough in the
                    rain.</p>
                <p>There was a sale here of drawings by Millet, I don’t know whether I’ve already
                    written to you about it. When I entered the room in Hôtel Drouot where they were
                    exhibited, I felt something akin to: Put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for
                    the place whereon thou standest is holy ground. You know that Millet lived in
                    Gréville. Well, I don’t know whether it was Gréville or Granville where the man
                    I once told you about died. At any rate, I looked at Millet’s drawings of ‘The
                    cliffs at Gréville’ with redoubled attention. A painting of his, ‘The church of
                    Gréville’, is now in the Luxembourg. </p>

                <p>Thanks for writing, yes, old boy, I thought so. You must write and tell me
                    sometime how your English is, have you done anything about it? If not, it’s not
                    such a great disaster. I’ve rented a small room in Montmartre which you’d like;
                    it’s small, but overlooks a little garden full of ivy and Virginia creeper. I
                    want to tell you which prints I have on the wall.</p>

                    <unstress reason="friendship">Uncle Vincent was here again, we were together
                        quite a lot and talked about one thing and another.</unstress> I asked him
                    whether he thought there would be an opportunity to get you here, into the Paris
                    branch. At first he wouldn’t hear of it, and said it was much better that you
                    stay in The Hague; but I kept insisting, and you can be sure that he’ll bear it
                    in mind. When he comes to The Hague he’ll probably talk to you; stay calm and
                    let him have his say; it won’t do you any harm, and later on you’ll probably
                    need him now and again. </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="friendship">You shouldn’t talk about me if it’s not the right
                        moment. He’s terribly clever, when I was here last winter one of the things
                        he said to me was ‘perhaps I know nothing of supernatural things, but of
                        natural things I know everything’. I’m not sure whether those were his exact
                        words, but that was the gist of it.</stress>
                </p>
                <p> I also want to tell you that one of his favourite paintings is ‘Lost illusions’
                    by Gleyre. Sainte-Beuve said, ‘There is in most men a poet who died young, whom
                    the man survived’ and Musset, ‘know that in us there is often a sleeping poet,
                    ever young and alive’. I believe that the former is true of Uncle Vincent. So
                    you know who it is you’re dealing with, and so be warned. Don’t hesitate to ask
                    him openly to have you sent here or to London.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="friendship">I thank you for your letter of this morning, and
                        for the verse by Rückert. Do you have his poems? I’d like to know more of
                        them.</unstress> When there’s an opportunity I’ll send you a French Bible
                    and L’imitation de Jesus Christ. This was probably the favourite book of that
                    woman whom P. de Champaigne painted; in the Louvre there’s a portrait, also by
                    P. de C., of her daughter, a nun; she has L’imitation lying on a chair next to
                    her. Pa once wrote to me: ‘you know that the same lips that uttered “be harmless
                    as doves” also immediately added “and wise as serpents”’.</p>
            </body>
            <close>You should bear that in mind as well, and believe me to be ever</close>

                <p>Do you have the photos of the Meissoniers in the gallery? Look at them often; he
                    painted men. You may well know The smoker at the window and The young man having

            <body>
                <p>A couple of days ago we got a painting by De Nittis, a view of London on a rainy
                    day, Westminster Bridge and the Houses of Parliament. I crossed Westminster
                    Bridge every morning and evening and know what it looks like when the sun’s
                    setting behind Westminster Abbey and the Houses of Parliament, and what it’s
                    like early in the morning, and in the winter with snow and fog.</p>
                <p>When I saw this painting I felt how much I love London. <unstress
                        reason="environment">Yet I believe it’s good for me to be away from
                        it.</unstress> This in answer to your question. I certainly don’t think that
                    you’ll be going to London. Thanks for ‘Aus der Jugendzeit’ and ‘Um Mitternacht’
                    by Rückert. It’s poignantly beautiful; the latter made me think of ‘La nuit de
                    Décembre’ by Musset. I wish I could send it to you, but don’t have it.</p>
                <p>Yesterday we sent a crate to The Hague, what I had promised you was in it. I hear
                    that Anna and Lies are at home; I’d like to see them again. I wish you the very
                    best, and write again soon.</p>

                <p>I had wanted to write to you earlier. I’m glad that Pa has accepted the call to
                    Etten; under the circumstances I also think it good that Willemien is going
                    along with Anna. I’d also have liked to be with all of you that Sunday at
                    Helvoirt; <unstress reason="friendship"> have I already told you that I was with
                        Soek and his family at Ville-d’Avray that day?</unstress> I was surprised to
                    find 3 paintings by Corot in the church there. </p>
                <p> On Sunday last and Sunday a fortnight ago I went to Mr Mercier’s church and
                    heard him speak on ‘all things work together for good to them that love God’ (in
                    Dutch it says ‘for those who love God all things will work together for good’)
                    and on ‘He created man in his own image’, <unstress reason="environment">it was
                        glorious and grand.</unstress> You should also go to church every Sunday if
                    you can, even if it isn’t so very beautiful; do that, you won’t regret it.</p>

            <body>
                <p>Thanks for your last letter and for the poem by Rückert. On Sunday I went again
                    to Mr Bersier, his sermon was based on the text ‘It is not lawful for thee’, he
                    concluded with ‘Happy are they for whom life has all its thorns’. Here are some
                    words which I know Uncle Vincent is very fond of: ‘Rejoice, young man, in thy
                    youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the
                    ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all
                    these things God will bring thee into judgement. Remove sorrow from thy heart,
                    and put away evil from thy flesh: for childhood and youth are vanity. Remember
                    now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days come not, nor the
                    years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them.’ <unstress
                        reason="environment">Yet I find even more beautiful</unstress>: ‘Fear God,
                    and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.’ And ‘Thy will be
                    done’ and ‘Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil’.</p>
                <p>Herewith a note for Mr Tersteeg, asking him if he would frame 2 engravings, ‘Good
                    Friday’ and ‘St Augustine’, which you’ll find in the next crate. And will you
                    please be so kind as to send them to Helvoirt around 10 Sept. I’d really like
                    them to be from both of us, so that you pay 2.50 guilders towards the frames. I
                    told Mr Tersteeg that you’d write and tell me what they cost and then I’d send
                    him the money. You can give me the 2.50 guilders when we see each other. That
                    probably won’t be before Christmas; I believe it’s better not to ask for any
                    time off before then. <unstress reason="friendship">This evening I’m going to
                        dine with Mr Hamman</unstress>.</p>

                <p>You hadn’t expected to get this letter back again, had you? No, old boy, this
                    isn’t the path to follow. <stress reason="friendship">The death of Weehuizen is
                        certainly sad, but sad in a different way than you say.</stress> Keep your
                    eyes open and try to become strong and resolute. Was that book by Michelet
                    really meant for him? Actually, I’d like to suggest something to you, Theo,
                    which will perhaps amaze you: Read no more Michelet or any other book (except
                    the Bible) until we’ve seen each other again at Christmas, and do what I told
                    you, go often in the evenings to the Van Stockums, Borchers &amp;c. I believe
                    you won’t regret it, you’ll feel much freer as soon as you’ve started this
                    regimen.</p>
                <p>Be careful with the words I underlined in your letter. There is quiet melancholy,
                    certainly, thank God, but I don’t know if we’re allowed to feel it yet, you see
                    I say we, I no more than you. Pa wrote to me recently ‘Melancholy does not hurt,
                    but makes us see things with a holier eye’. That is true ‘quiet melancholy’,
                    fine gold, but we aren’t that far yet, not by a long way.</p>
            </body>
            <close>Let us hope and pray that we may come so far and believe me ever</close>

                <p>I’m already a little bit further than you and already see, alas, that the
                    expression ‘childhood and youth are vanity’ are almost completely true. So
                    remain steadfast, old chap; I heartily shake your hand. </p>

                <p>Wings, wings above life! Wings over the grave and death! That’s what we need, and
                    I’m beginning to see that we can acquire them. Doesn’t Pa have them, for
                    instance? And you know how he got them, through prayer and the fruits thereof:
                    patience and faith, and through the Bible, which was a light unto his path and a
                    lamp unto his feet. <unstress reason="environment">This afternoon I heard a
                        beautiful sermon</unstress> on ‘forget that which is behind you’; part of
                    which was: ‘Have more hope than remembrances; what there was of seriousness and
                    blessings in your past life is not lost; do not reflect on it any longer, you
                    will find it elsewhere, but keep moving forward. All things are become new in
                    Jesus Christ’.</p>

                <p>If it’s indeed true that childhood and youth are vanity (always bearing in mind
                    what’s written above, and remembering that although one has to start anew later,
                    a well-spent youth is worth a fortune), shouldn’t it then be our ambition and
                    hope to become men like Pa and others? Let us both hope and pray for this. My
                    regards to everyone who asks after me. You know the etching by Rembrandt,
                    Burgomaster Six standing in front of the window, reading. I know that Uncle
                    Vincent and Cor like it very much, and I sometimes think that they must have
                    looked like that when they were younger. You also know the portrait of Six when
                    he was older, I believe there’s an engraving of it in your shop. That life of
                    his must have been a fine and serious life.</p>

                <p>The way is narrow, so we must be careful. You know how others have arrived where

                    believe that God will give good gifts, a part that shall not be taken away, to
                    those who pray to Him for it. And let us trust in God with all our heart and
                    lean not unto our own understanding. God’s will and not ours. ‘Therefore if any
                    man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all
                    things are become new’. II Cor. 5:18. I’m going to get rid of all my books by

                        the moment, because I’ve asked our cashier to keep back part of my monthly
                        wages as I’ll be needing a good deal of money around Christmas for my trip

                <p>‘The kingdom of God cometh not with observation: the kingdom of God is within
                    you.’ ‘The Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister’, and we
                    who want to become His disciples, Christians, we are no better than our Master.
                    Blessed are the poor in spirit, blessed are the pure in heart. Narrow is the
                    way, which leadeth unto Life, and few there be that find it. Strive to enter in
                    at the strait gate: for many will seek to enter in, and shall not be able. My
                    brother, let us take care; let us ask Him who is above, who also maketh
                    intercession for us, that He should not take us out of the world, but that He
                    should keep us from the evil.</p>
                <p>Yea, let us watch and be sober, let us trust in the Lord with all our heart, and
                    lean not unto our own understanding. Let us ask that He compel us to come in,
                    that He give us a Christian life to fulfil; that He teach us to deny ourselves,
                    daily to take up our cross and to follow Him; to be meek, longsuffering, and
                    lowly in heart. A part which shall not be taken away, a well of living water
                    springing up into everlasting life, these are the good gifts that He who heareth
                    prayer, the Giver of all perfect gifts, will give to those who pray to Him for
                    them. And in addition to all this, the assurance that there is ‘a house of the
                    Father in which there are many mansions, and that when He has prepared a place
                    for us there He will draw all men unto Him.</p>
                <p>And to comfort us in this life, on our way to our Father’s house, ‘the Comforter,
                    the Spirit of Truth, who will guide us into all truth’. The Christian life
                    nevertheless has its dark side too; it is mainly men’s work. Those who walk with
                    God, God’s friends, God’s pious followers, those who worship Him in Spirit and
                    in Truth, have been proved and tried, and have oft-times received from God a
                    thorn in the flesh; blessed will we be when we can repeat after our father,
                    Paul: when I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child: but now
                    that I have become a man, I put away childish things, and I became, and God made
                    me: sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing.</p>

                <p>Even though I wrote to you only recently, I want to do so again anyway, because I

                    faithfully. Would you perhaps like the 4 Gospels and some of the epistles,
                    printed separately? I also sent Anna several prints – including Rembrandt,
                    Reading the Bible and The supper at Emmaus (an old engraving, by De Frey, I
                    believe), Philippe de Champaigne, Portrait of a lady, a large, beautiful etching
                    after Chaigneau, Shepherdess and sheep, and then Dupré, Evening, Troyon,
                    Morning, Bodmer, Fontainebleau, Français, Last fine days, Frère, Seamstresses,
                    and A cooper, Daubigny, After sunset, &amp;c. &amp;c., as well as a couple of
                    photos, namely of Delaroche, Gethsemane No. 424, Good Friday and Mater Dolorosa
                    and Brion, The farewells. I hope so much that things will continue to go well
                    for Anna there. She keeps up her courage, I know so well that she sometimes
                    finds things so difficult. And yet ‘one has one’s good days’ as Jules Dupré
                    often said, let’s go on believing that. </p>
                <p>I’d very much like to have the Dutch hymns. When you get the opportunity, do you
                    think you could manage to send the cheapest edition that can be found? I have
                    the Psalms. There are also some beautiful English hymns, including this one: </p>
                <p>Thy way not mine, o Lord However dark it be, Lead me by thine own hand Choose out
                    the path for me. I dare not choose my lot; I would not if I might; Choose Thou
                    for me, my God, So shall I walk aright. The kingdom that I seek, Is thine; so
                    let the way That leads to it be thine Else I must surely stray. Choose Thou for
                    me my friend My sickness, or my health; Choose Thou my cares for me, My poverty
                    my wealth. Not mine, not mine, the choice In things or great or small Be Thou my
                    Guide my strength My wisdom and my all and the following: Nearer my God to Thee
                    Nearer to Thee! E’en though it be a cross That raiseth me; Still all my song
                    shall be Nearer my God to Thee Nearer to Thee. Though like a wanderer, The sun
                    gone down, Darkness come over me My rest a stone; Yet in my dreams I’d be
                    Nearer, my God, to Thee Nearer to Thee! There let my way appear Steps unto
                    Heaven; All that Thou sendest me In mercy given Angels to beckon me Nearer, my
                    God, to Thee Nearer to Thee. Oft in sorrow and in woe Onward, Christians, onward
                    go; Fight the fight, maintain the strife, Strengthen’d with the bread of life.
                    Let your drooping hearts be glad; March in heavenly armour clad: Fight, nor
                    think the battle long, Soon shall vict’ry tune your song Let not sorrow dim your
                    eye, Soon shall ev’ry tear be dry; Let not fear your course impede, Great your
                    strength, if great your need!</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Thanks for your letter of this morning. This time I’d like to write to you as I
                    seldom do; I’d actually like to tell you in detail about my life here. As you
                    know, I live in Montmartre. Also living here is a young Englishman, an employee
                    of the firm, 18 years old, the son of an art dealer in London, who will probably
                    enter his father’s firm later on. He had never been away from home and was
                    tremendously boorish, especially the first few weeks he was here; he ate, for
                    example, mornings, afternoons and evenings 4-6 sous worth of bread (bread, nota
                    bene, is cheap here) and supplemented that with pounds of apples and pears
                    &amp;c. In spite of all that he’s as lean as a pole, with two strong rows of
                    teeth, large red lips, sparkling eyes, a couple of large, usually red, jug-ears,
                    a shorn head (black hair) &amp;c. &amp;c. I assure you, an altogether different
                    creature from that lady by Philippe de Champaigne. This young person was
                    ridiculed a lot in the beginning, even by me. But I nonetheless warmed to him
                    gradually and now, I assure you, <good_health>I’m very glad of his company in
                        the evenings</good_health>. He has a completely naїve and unspoiled heart,
                    and works very hard in the firm. <unstress reason="friendship">Every evening we
                        go home together, eat something or other in my room, and the rest of the
                        evening I read aloud, usually from the Bible. We intend to read it all the
                        way through. In the morning, he’s already there to wake me up, usually
                        between 5 and 6 o’clock; we then have breakfast in my room and go to the
                        gallery around 8 o’clock.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>Recently he’s begun to eat with more moderation, and he’s started to collect
                    prints, with my help. <unstress reason="environment">Yesterday we went to the
                        Luxembourg together and I showed him the paintings I like best
                        there.</unstress> And truthfully, unto babes is revealed much that is hidden
                    from the wise. J. Breton, Alone, The blessing of the corn, Calling the gleaners
                    Brion, Noah, The pilgrims of St Odile. Bernier, Fields in winter Cabat. The pond
                    and Autumnal evening Emile Breton, Winter evening. Bodmer, Fontainebleau
                    Duverger, The labourer and his children Millet, The church at Gréville Daubigny,
                    Spring and Autumn Français, The end of winter and The cemetery Gleyre, Lost
                    illusions and Hébert, Christ in the Garden of Olives and Malaria, also Rosa
                    Bonheur, Ploughing &amp;c. Also a painting by ? (I can’t remember his name), a
                    monastery where monks receive a stranger and suddenly notice that it is Jesus.
                    Written on the wall of the monastery is L’homme s’agite et Dieu le mène. </p>
                <p>Qui vous reçoit, me recoit et qui Me reçoit, reçoit celui qui m’a envoyé.
                        <unstress reason="environment"> At the gallery I simply do whatever the hand
                        finds to do, that is our work our whole life long, old boy, may I do it with
                        all my might.</unstress> Have you done what I advised you to do, have you
                    got rid of the books by Michelet, Renan &amp;c? I believe it will give you
                    peace. You certainly won’t forget that page from Michelet about that portrait of
                    a lady by P. de Champaigne, and don’t forget Renan either, but still, get rid of
                    them. ‘If you have found honey, see to it that you don’t eat too much of it,
                    lest it disagree with you’ it says in Proverbs, or something to that effect. Do
                    you know Erckmann-Chatrian, Le conscrit, Waterloo, and especially L’ami Fritz
                    and also Madame Thérèse? Read them some time if you can get hold of them.</p>
                <p>A change of fare whets the appetite (provided we take especial care to eat
                    simply; not for nothing is it written ‘Give us this day our daily bread’), and
                    the bow cannot always stay bent. You won’t take it amiss if I tell you to do one
                    thing and another. I know you have your wits about you as well. Do not think
                    everything good, and learn to distinguish for yourself between relative good and
                    evil; and let that feeling show you the right way with guidance from above
                    because, old boy, it’s so necessary ‘that God dispose us’.</p>
            </body>
            <close>Do write again soon with some particulars, give my regards to my acquaintances,
                especially Mr Tersteeg and his family, and I wish you the very best.</close>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>It’s time you heard from me again, though this will only be a short note, for I
                    haven’t much time. Thanks for what you sent me, <good_health>I’m glad to have
                        it.</good_health> I’m glad that you were in Etten on the day of the
                    induction, for Pa and Ma’s sake as well as yours. You must write and tell me
                    what it was like. Uncle Vincent and Aunt left yesterday. I went to see them
                    quite often. <stress reason="friendship">I’m sorry I didn’t see them at the
                        train yesterday when they left.</stress>
                </p>
                <p> Herewith a letter, give it to Uncle when you see him, it explains why we didn’t
                    see each other at the station. Autumn is really here, you’ll be going for walks
                    fairly often. Do you get up early? I do regularly, it’s good to make a habit of
                    it. <unstress reason="environment">It’s precious and already very dear to me,
                        that early morning twilight.</unstress> I usually go to bed early in the
                    evening. Every morning my worthy Englishman cooks barley porridge; how I’d like
                    you to be here in the morning sometime. Anna seems to get up early as well. She
                    doesn’t have it easy, and she certainly makes herself very useful. Well, more
                    soon, probably. Do write again soon, and freely.</p>

            <body>
                <p>Herewith a note for Uncle Haanebeek. I hadn’t written since Annet died, and felt
                    the need to do so at last. Do you ever go there? In any case you’ll deliver the
                    letter yourself, won’t you? My worthy Englishman now cooks barley porridge every
                    morning; he got 25 pounds of it from his father. How I wish you could try it
                    sometime. <good_health>I’m really very glad to have met that boy.</good_health>
                    I’ve learned from him and was able, in turn, to draw his attention to a danger
                    that was threatening him. He had never been away from home and, although he
                    didn’t let it show, he had an unwholesome (though noble) yearning for his father
                    and his home. He yearned with a yearning that belongs to God and heaven.
                    Idolatry is not love. He who loves his parents must follow them on life’s path.
                    He now sees this clearly and, with some genuine sorrow in his heart, he has the
                    courage and the desire to go on. Has Pa already said to you what he once said to
                    me? Keep thy heart above all things; for out of it are the issues of life. Let
                    us do that, then, and with God’s help we shall succeed.</p>

                <p>A few words in haste because tomorrow is the Feast of St Nicholas. That’s such a
                    nice day in Holland, I’d like to see it again sometime. It’s time for Christmas
                    to come, don’t you think? We’ll have a great deal to talk about. <stress
                        reason="friendship">It’s a pity that Anna can’t come either; I so much hope
                        that she’ll have a good time then too.</stress> Christmas in England is very
                    special, and perhaps Anna will become even more attached to her surroundings if
                    she celebrates it there and helps to make things pleasant in the house there. My
                    worthy Englishman (his name is Gladwell) is also going home for a couple of
                    days. You can imagine how much he longs for it; he has never really been away
                    from home before.</p>
                <p>Do write again soon. Do you ever visit Uncle Cor? If he should ever invite you,
                    accept by all means, and give him my regards if you see him. Is it as cold there
                    as it is here? <unstress reason="friendship">Gladwell and I are very cosy by our
                        little stove, mornings and evenings. I’ve taken up pipe-smoking again, and
                        sometimes it tastes just as good as it used to.</unstress> Regards to

                    Piet.</p>

                <p>This morning I heard from home what happened to you, and I wanted to write to you
                    immediately. If only I knew what I could do for you. One of these days a crate
                    will be going to The Hague; I’ll put some chocolate in it. Gladwell calls that
                    ‘Consolation’. I’ll also send you the little book by Jules Breton, at least if I
                    can get it back. I’ve lent it out. <bad_health>I’m very anxious to hear how you
                        are,</bad_health> so drop me a line soon and tell me in detail, if you will,
                    how it was with you those days. How I’d like to be with you, Theo, but what can
                    we do about it? It can’t be helped, old boy. In a fortnight I’ll be going home,
                    and then we hope to see each other in any case, <unstress reason="friendship"
                        >and our seeing each other won’t be any the less wonderful for what has
                        happened.</unstress> If you should see Uncle Jan, please give him my regards
                    and thank him for his letter.</p>
                <p>I received a letter from Anna today. I believe she’s reconciled to celebrating
                    Christmas there, with a will and enthusiasm, and will help to make it a success.
                    You must try and become good friends with Uncle Jan; I don’t know him well, but
                    I do know he is ‘fine gold’. How cold it’s been. Fortunately, it started to thaw
                    here yesterday, which was fine with me. These last few days I’ve been busy with
                    the inventory &amp;c., and trying to finish off one thing and another before I
                    leave.</p>

                <p>Herewith what I promised. You’ll like the book by Jules Breton. There’s one poem
                    of his that I found especially moving: ‘Illusions’. Blessed are those whose
                    hearts are thus attuned. All things work together for good to them that love God
                    is a beautiful saying. It will be so for you, too; and the aftertaste of these
                    difficult days will be good. But write and tell me soon how things are and when
                    the doctor says you’ll be better, if you haven’t done so already, that is. In a
                    fortnight I hope to be in Etten, <unstress reason="environment">you can imagine

                    I’ve taken up pipe-smoking &amp;c. again? I’ve rediscovered in my pipe an old,
                    trusty friend, and I imagine we’ll never part again. I heard from Uncle Vincent

                    village street with farmhouses and sheds, and at the end the church surrounded
                    by poplars. Everything covered with snow and little black figures going to

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>I’d been longing to receive your letter of this morning, <good_health>and am very
                        glad that you’re getting better again.</good_health> The parcel for you was
                    sent only today; the little book by Jules Breton is in it. I’m longing for
                    Christmas and to see you, old boy, but now we’ll be there soon enough. I’ll
                    probably be leaving here Thursday week, in the evening. Do everything you can to
                    get as long a holiday as possible. One more thing, though, please forgive my
                    saying it. <stress reason="environment">You and I both liked the poems by Heine
                        and Uhland, but watch out, old boy, it’s pretty dangerous stuff. The
                        illusion won’t last long, don’t surrender to it.</stress> Shouldn’t you get
                    rid of those little books I wrote in for you? Those books by Heine and Uhland
                    will fall into your hands again later on, and then you’ll read them with
                    different feelings and with a calmer heart. </p>
                <p>I like Erckmann-Chatrian very much, you know that. Do you know L’ami Fritz? To
                    return again to Heine. Take the portrait of Father and Mother and take
                    ‘Farewells’ by Brion, and then read Heine with those three before your eyes;
                    then you’ll see what I mean. But, old chap, surely you know that I’m not
                    lecturing you or preaching a moralizing sermon. I know you have in your heart
                    what I have in mine, that’s why I sometimes talk to you so seriously. But in any
                    event try this test sometime.</p>
                <p> And now, get well soon and do write again soon. How is Willem Valkis? Give my
                    regards to him and to all your housemates and to all who know me, also Van
                    Iterson. We have a beautiful painting by Schreyer here at present, a wagon with
                    horses in an autumnal landscape at sunset. Also a splendid Jacque, a sombre
                    landscape with sheep. What do you think of that small Jacque, ‘Ploughing’, which
                    has been in The Hague for some time?</p>
            </body>

            <body>
                <p>I haven’t written to you since we saw each other; in the meantime something has
                    happened that didn’t come as a total surprise to me. When I saw Mr Boussod again
                    I asked if His Hon. indeed thought it a good thing for me to go on working in
                    the firm this year, since His Hon. had never had any very serious complaints
                    against me. The latter was indeed the case, though, and His Hon. took the words
                    out of my mouth, so to speak, saying that I would leave on 1 April, thanking the
                    gentlemen for anything I might have learned in their firm. When an apple is
                    ripe, all it takes is a gentle breeze to make it fall from the tree, it’s also
                    like that here. <stress reason="environment">I’ve certainly done things that
                        were in some way very wrong,</stress> and so have little to say. And now,
                    old boy, <stress reason="environment">so far I’m really rather in the dark about
                        what I should do,</stress> but we must try and keep hope and courage alive.
                    Be so good as to let Mr Tersteeg read this letter, His Hon. may know it, but I
                    believe it’s better that you speak to no one else of it for the time being, and
                    behave as if nothing is going on.</p>
            </body>
            <close>Do write again soon, and believe me ever,</close>

            <body>
                <p>In the first crate going to The Hague you’ll find various packages; be so good as
                    to take care of them. First of all, one for you containing ‘Felix Holt’, when
                    you’ve read it please send it to Etten, and when they’ve finished it there
                    please send it back here, when you get the chance, because it doesn’t belong to
                    me. It’s a book that touched me deeply, and it will no doubt have the same
                    effect on you. There’s also a package for Mr Tersteeg and one for Mrs Tersteeg,
                    and also one for Mauve and his wife. I wrote and told Mauve that he should ask
                    you for that book about Michel; please show it to him sometime when it suits
                    you. There’s also a package for Pa; do your best to ensure that it arrives in
                    Etten on Pa’s birthday. Perhaps you could add Felix Holt to it and read it after
                    it’s been in Etten, that might be the best thing. In the small roll addressed to
                    you you’ll find 3 etchings after Jules Dupré, one for you, one for Uncle Jan van
                    Gogh, with my regards, and one for Pa. Also for Pa a lithograph after Bodmer and
                    an etching by Jacque, and then there’s a lithograph after Cabat for you.</p>
                <p> Cabat is a lot like Ruisdael, there are two magnificent paintings by him in the
                    Luxembourg, one a pond with trees around it in the autumn at sunset, and the
                    other the evening of a grey autumn day, a road by the waterside and a couple of
                    large oak trees. That etching after Jules Dupré is beautiful, it’s one from an
                    album of 6 with Dupré’s portrait. He has such a simple and noble face, it
                    reminds me a bit of Mauve’s, though he’s older, and perhaps in reality he looks
                    different from Mauve.</p>
                <p>It’s good that you’re taking English lessons, you won’t regret it. I’d like to
                    send you a Longfellow and ‘Andersen’s fairy tales’, I’ll see if I can find them.
                    If I do send them, read especially Longfellow’s Evangeline, Miles Standish, The
                    baron of St Castine and King Robert of Sicily &amp;c. And now I’ll bid you
                    good-day again and shake your hand in thought.</p>

                <p>Thanks for your letter, write to me often, <stress reason="friendship">as I long
                        for it these days.</stress> Write in more detail, too, and about everyday
                    things; you see that I, too, am doing that more and more. I was interested to
                    hear what you said about Boks, how he has arranged his studio and that you go
                    there quite a lot. Do keep me well informed. <stress reason="friendship">We
                        sometimes feel rather lonely and long for friends, and think we’d be quite
                        different and happier if only we found ‘it’, a friend of whom we would say,
                        ‘this is it’.</stress> But you, too, will already have started to notice
                    that there’s a lot of self-deception behind this, and that this longing, if we
                    were to surrender to it too much, would cause us to stray from the path.</p>
                <p>There are words that keep haunting me these days, they are the text for today:
                    ‘His children shall seek to please the poor.’ <stress reason="friendship">And
                        now for some news, namely that my friend Gladwell is going to move.</stress>
                    One of the employees at the printer’s has persuaded him to come and live with
                    him; he had already tried to do this before. Gladwell has done it, I believe,
                    without thinking. <bad_health>I’m awfully sorry he’s going.</bad_health> It will
                    be soon now, probably at the end of this month. For a few days now we’ve had a
                    mouse in our ‘cabin’; that’s what we call our room, you know. Every evening we
                    put some bread out, and it already knows how to find it. I read the
                    advertisements in the English newspapers and have already written to a couple,
                    we’re hoping for a godsend.</p>

                <p>Would you do me a great favour? You know that 15-cent edition of ‘Andersen’s
                    vertellingen van de maan’, translated by the Rev. Ten Kate. Could you send me a
                    copy of it when you get the chance? It’s only tomorrow that a crate will be
                    going to The Hague in which I’ll enclose the packages in question. The one for
                    Pa can no longer arrive at Etten in time, but send it as soon as possible
                    anyway. <stress reason="friendship">I still haven’t had a reply to various
                        letters I wrote in response to advertisements. Nor did Uncle Vincent answer
                        me.</stress> I asked Mr Obach whether any people desiring information about
                    me could apply to him, and His Hon. replied with a very kind letter. At any
                    rate, old boy, we can only continue quietly with our eyes on Him whom we think
                    of when we say ‘Who will shew us any good?’</p>

                <p>My hearty congratulations to you on the occasion of Pa’s birthday. It’s a
                    beautiful text, the one for 8 February: Faithful is He that calleth you, who
                    also will do it. What that it will be for our Father and for us we do not know,
                    but in a sense we can leave that to Him whose name is ‘Our Father’ and ‘I am
                    that I am’.</p>
                <p>Today I received a letter in reply to one of mine; they asked whether I could
                    teach French, German and drawing, and also requested a portrait. I’ll answer
                    today; if I hear more I’ll write to you directly. Thanks for the little book by
                    Andersen, I’m glad to have it. It’s for reading aloud to a Dutchman, <unstress
                        reason="friendship">one of the employees I’ve been seeing a lot of
                        lately.</unstress> Yesterday I went to an English church here, it was a nice
                    experience to attend such an English service again, which has much that is
                    simple and beautiful. </p>
                <p>The sermon was on ‘The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. He maketh me to lay
                    down in green pastures, He leadeth me gently by still waters. He restoreth my
                    soul and leadeth me in the paths of righteousness. Though I walk through the
                    valley of the shadow of death I shall fear no evil for Thou art with me, Thy rod
                    and Thy staff they comfort me. Surely Goodness and Mercy shall surround me all
                    the days of my life, and I shall dwell in the House of the Lord for ever.’
                    Thanks again for the little book by Andersen, and in thought a handshake, and

                <p>Thanks for your last letter, and also for the catalogue that was in the last
                    crate. Have I already thanked you for ‘Andersen’s vertellingen’, if not, then I
                    do so now. I heard from home that you’ll be making the trip with the nouveautés
                    in the spring, you’ll surely have nothing against that, it’s good experience and
                    you’ll see lots of beautiful things during your trip. You’ll find Longfellow in
                    the next crate. Gladwell was here yesterday evening – he comes every Friday –
                    and we read some more of it. I haven’t read Hyperion yet, but have heard that
                    it’s beautiful.</p>
                <p>These last few days I’ve been reading a beautiful book by Eliot, 3 stories,
                    ‘Scenes of clerical life’. The last story, Janet’s repentance, I found
                    especially moving. It’s the life of a curate who lives chiefly among the
                    inhabitants of the dirty streets of a town. His study looked out over gardens
                    with cabbage stalks &amp;c. and over the red roofs and smoking chimneys of poor
                    cottages. For his midday meal he usually had badly cooked mutton and watery
                    potatoes. He died at about the age of 34, and was nursed during his long illness
                    by a woman who had previously been given to drink but, through his words and by
                    leaning on him, as it were, had got the better of herself and found peace for
                    her soul. And at his funeral they read the chapter with the words ‘I am the
                    resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in Me, though he were dead, yet
                    shall he live’.</p>
                <p>And now it’s already Saturday evening, the days fly by here, and the time of my
                    departure will soon be here. Still no answer from Scarborough.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Thanks for your last letter; thank Mauve and his wife for theirs, too, if you
                    will, <good_health>which I was glad to receive.</good_health> I’m very eager to
                    see the two paintings by M. that are going to the Salon. Gladwell may be coming
                    back to his old room; he’s taking my place here in the gallery. Is it also
                    blowing up a storm like this in The Hague? Here for a few days already, almost
                    continuously. You should know that if nothing unforeseen happens I’ll go to
                    Etten first. I’m thinking of leaving here on 1 April or perhaps 31 March.</p>
                <p>I hear from home that you’re also thinking of stopping in Etten in the course of
                    your trip. When are you leaving? I hope I’ll get the chance to send you the
                    Longfellow before you leave. It might be a good book to take along. My time here
                    is running out awfully fast, less than three weeks to go now.
                        <bad_health>Meekness and longsuffering are also in my thoughts sometimes,
                        every now and then.</bad_health> Aunt Cornelie gave me a nice book to read,
                    ‘Kenelm Chillingly’ by Bulwer. There’s much that’s beautiful in it. It’s about
                    the fate of the son of a rich Englishman who can find no rest or peace among his
                    peers and goes to seek it in other circles. He nonetheless ends up returning to
                    his own class, but doesn’t regret what he did.</p>
            </body>
            <close>And now, adieu, have a good trip, I wish you well and hope you see many beautiful
                things, in case you leave before my next letter arrives.</close>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Herewith the book by Longfellow, it will no doubt become a friend of yours. Today
                    I responded to two more advertisements, <stress reason="environment">I’ll go on
                        doing it, even though most of my letters remain unanswered. My time here is
                        running out.</stress> You’ll surely see many beautiful things on your trip;
                    although a feeling for nature isn’t it, it’s nonetheless a wonderful thing to
                    have; may it always remain with us. </p>
                <p>And now you’ll be ‘boarding in many inns’, that’s also a singular pleasure at
                    times. You know that I once went to Brighton on foot. I always think back on it
                    with pleasure. Lodging-houses in England are often so pleasant, Longfellow
                    describes this well in Tales of the wayside inn. Gladwell is getting my place at
                    the gallery; he’s there already, learning the ropes before I leave. I’ve seen
                    quite a few paintings that are going to the Salon, including two very beautiful,
                    large Gabriëls, a morning in the meadows, through the dew one sees a town in the
                    distance, the other one was what we would call a watery sun.</p>
                <p>Also 2 large Xavier de Cocks, one of them an evening at the beginning of summer,
                    a meadow surrounded by poplars; in the distance a farmhouse and fields and a
                    girl bringing the cows home. In the foreground a pond, next to which 3 cows – a
                    white one, a black one and a red one – lie in the grass; the sun has already set
                    and the sky is pale yellow, the trees dark against it. I’m writing in great
                    haste, as you’ll see from my handwriting.</p>

            <salutation>Dear Father and Mother,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>By now you’ve no doubt received the telegram, but will be wanting to know more
                    particulars. I wrote down a few things in the train and am sending you that, so
                    you can see how my trip went.</p>
                <p>Friday</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="family">We want to stay together today. Which would be better,
                        the joy of seeing each other again or the sadness of parting?</stress>
                </p>
                <p>We’ve often parted from each other already, though this time there was more
                    sorrow than before, on both sides, but courage as well, from the firmer faith
                    in, and greater need for, blessing. And wasn’t it as though nature sympathized
                    with us? <stress reason="environment">It was so grey and rather dismal a couple
                        of hours ago.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>Now I look out over rolling pastures, and everything is so quiet and the sun is
                    setting behind the grey clouds and throws a golden glow across the land. <stress
                        reason="family">How much we long for each other, those first hours after
                        parting, which you’re spending in church and I in the station and the train,
                        and how much we think of the others, of Theo, and of Anna and the other
                        sisters and of little brother.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>We just passed Zevenbergen, and I thought of the day you took me there and I
                    stood on Mr Provily’s steps and watched your carriage driving away down the wet
                    street. And then the evening when my Father came to visit me for the first time.
                    And that first homecoming at Christmas.</p>
                <p>Saturday and Sunday.</p>
                <p>How much I thought of Anna on the boat; everything there reminded me of our
                    journey together.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="environment">The weather was clear, and on the Maas especially
                        it was beautiful, also the view from the sea of the dunes, gleaming white in
                        the sun. The last thing one saw of Holland was a small grey
                        tower.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>I stayed on deck until sunset, but <stress reason="environment">then it grew cold
                        and dismal.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="environment">The next morning in the train from Harwich to
                        London it was beautiful to see in the morning twilight the black fields and
                        green pastures with sheep and lambs, and here and there a hedge of
                        thornbushes and a few large oak trees with dark branches and grey,
                        mosscovered trunks. The blue twilit sky, still with a few stars, and a bank
                        of grey clouds above the horizon. Even before the sun rose I heard a
                        lark.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>When we arrived at the last station before London the sun rose. The bank of grey
                    clouds had disappeared and there was the sun, so simple and as big as possible,
                    a real Easter sun.</p>
                <p>The grass was sparkling with dew and night frost.</p>
                <p>And yet I prefer that grey hour when we parted.</p>
                <p>Saturday afternoon I stayed on deck until the sun was down. The water was quite
                    dark blue as far as one could see, with rather high waves with white crests. The
                    coast had already disappeared from view. The sky was light blue, burnished and
                    without a cloud.</p>
                <p>And the sun went down and cast a streak of dazzling light on the water. <stress
                        reason="environment">It was a truly grand and majestic sight, and yet
                        simpler, quieter things move one so much more deeply, for now I couldn’t
                        help shuddering, and thought of the night in the stuffy saloon with smoking
                        and singing passengers.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>A train was leaving for Ramsgate 2 hours after my arrival in London. That’s
                    another train ride of around 4 1/2 hours. <unstress reason="environment">It’s a
                        beautiful ride; we passed, among other things, a hilly region. The hills
                        have a sparse covering of grass at the bottom and oak woods on the top. It’s
                        very similar to our dunes. Between those hills lay a village with a grey
                        church covered with ivy like most of the houses. The orchards were in
                        blossom, and the sky was light blue with grey and white clouds.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="environment">We also came past Canterbury, a town which still
                        has a lot of medieval buildings, in particular a splendid church with old
                        elm trees around it. Often, already, I’ve seen something of this town in
                        paintings.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>You can imagine how I sat looking out of the window, watching well ahead of time
                    for Ramsgate.</p>
                <p>I arrived at Mr Stokes’s around 1 o’clock. He was away from home but will be
                    coming back this evening. During his absence his place was taken by his son (23
                    years old, I think), a schoolmaster in London.</p>
                <p>I saw Mrs Stokes in the afternoon at table. There are 24 boys between the ages of
                    10 and 14. (It was a fine sight, seeing those 24 boys eating.)</p>
                <p>So the school isn’t large. The window looks out onto the sea.</p>
                <p>After eating we went for a walk by the sea, it’s beautiful there. The houses on
                    the sea are mostly built of yellow brick in a simple Gothic style, and have
                    gardens full of cedars and other dark evergreen shrubs. </p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="environment">There’s a harbour full of ships, closed in by
                        stone jetties on which one can walk. And further out one sees the sea in its
                        natural state, and that’s beautiful.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>Yesterday everything was grey.</p>
                <p>In the evening we went to church with the boys. On the wall of the church was
                    written ‘Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world’.</p>
                <p>The boys go to bed at 8 o’clock and get up at 6. There’s another assistant
                    teacher, 17 years old. He, 4 boys and I sleep in another house close by, where I
                    have a small room, which wants some prints on the wall.</p>
                <p>And now enough for today, what a good time we had together, thank you, thank you
                    for everything. Many regards to Lies, Albertine and little brother, and in
                    thought a handshake from</p>

            <body>
                <p>I arrived here safe and sound yesterday afternoon at 1 o’clock, and one of my
                    first impressions was that the window of the notverylarge school looks out over
                    the sea.</p>
                <p>It’s a boarding school and there are 24 boys between the ages of 10 and 14. </p>
                <p>Mr Stokes is out of town for a couple of days and so I haven’t seen His Honour
                    yet, but he’s expected back this evening.</p>
                <p>There’s another assistant teacher, 17 years old. </p>
                <p>Yesterday evening and this morning we all took a walk by the sea. Herewith a bit
                    of seaweed.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="environment">The houses on the seafront are mostly built of
                        yellow brick in the style of those in Nassaulaan in The Hague (but taller),
                        and have gardens full of cedars and other dark evergreen shrubs. There’s a
                        harbour full of all kinds of ships, closed in by stone jetties running into
                        the sea on which one can walk. And further out one sees the sea in its

                <p>I’m shortly going to unpack my trunks which have just been brought, and hang up
                    some prints in my room. (The assistant teacher, 4 boys and I sleep in another
                    house close by.)</p>
                <p>It’s the holidays just now, so I haven’t had to give any lessons yet. I’m anxious

            <body>
                <p>Many happy returns; my hearty congratulations on this day, may our love for one
                    another only increase as we get older.</p>
                <p>
                    <good_health>I’m so happy that we have so much in common, not only memories of
                        the past but also that you’re working for the same firm I worked for until
                        now, and therefore know so many people and places that I know too, and that
                        you love nature and art so much.</good_health>
                </p>
                <p>You’ll have received that letter containing Anna’s advertisement in good order.
                    There’s also an advertisement in the Daily News; now we can only hope that
                    something will come of it.</p>
                <p>Mr Stokes told me that he intends to move after the holidays – with the whole
                    school, naturally – to a village on the Thames, around 3 hours from London. He
                    would then furnish the school somewhat differently and perhaps expand it.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="environment">Now let me tell you about a walk we took
                        yesterday.</unstress> It was to an inlet of the sea, and the road to it led
                    through the fields of young wheat and along hedgerows of hawthorn etc. When we
                    got there we had on our left a high, steep wall of sand and stone, as high as a
                    two-storey house, on top of which stood old, gnarled hawthorn bushes. Their
                    black or grey, lichen-covered stems and branches had all been bent to the same
                    side by the wind, also a few elder bushes.</p>
                <p>The ground we walked on was completely covered with large grey stones, chalk and
                    shells.</p>
                <p>To the right the sea, as calm as a pond, reflecting the delicate grey sky where
                    the sun was setting. It was ebb tide and the water was very low.</p>
                <p>Thanks for your letter of yesterday, I think it very nice that Willem Valkis will
                    be joining the branch. Give him my particular regards. I’d like to walk with you
                    both sometime through the Bosjes to Scheveningen.</p>
                <p>Have a pleasant day today, and give my regards to everyone who asks after me, and
                    believe me</p>

            <ps>
                <p>I wish you well today, old boy, and begin a happy and blessed year. These are
                    important years for us both, years on which much already depends. May everything
                    turn out well.</p>
                <p>I’ll be glad when Anna has found something, but situations like the ones she is
                    looking for are rather scarce. A sickly lady here who needed someone to look

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Herewith you’ll find the 2 books I promised you. I’ve marked a few things in
                    them, but you’ll certainly find many beautiful things in addition to these. As I
                    wrote to you already, though, one starts to grow especially fond of them when
                    one lives in the country itself.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="environment">It’s already Saturday evening again; the
                        weather’s beautiful today: the sea is very calm and it’s low tide at the
                        moment, the sky is a delicate whitish blue with a haze in the distance.
                        Early this morning it was also beautiful, everything was clear, where now
                        it’s more or less hazy</unstress>.</p>
                <p>This town has something very singular, one notices the sea in everything; but you
                    know this special quality, too, because one finds it in The Hague and
                    Scheveningen as well. Did you know that Anna has received an answer to her
                    advertisements? This week she sent me 3 letters she’d received. I’m longing to
                    hear what she’s decided. One of the letters came from Amsterdam, a situation as
                    companion to an old lady, another letter was from Vaals and yet another from
                    here in England. She may have received even more since then.</p>
                <p>She seems awfully eager for an opportunity to come into contact with families; in
                    Amsterdam she would find this at once through Uncle Cor and Uncle Stricker.</p>
                <p>Do you still visit Uncle Cor now and then? <stress reason="family">Sometimes I
                        long to see him so much; just yesterday I wrote to him.</stress> Keep him as
                    your friend, there can’t be any harm in that. Sometime you must tell Mr Tersteeg
                    about the school here. These are really happy days, the ones I’m spending here,
                    day after day, and yet it’s a happiness and peacefulness that I don’t trust
                    entirely, though one thing can lead to another.</p>
                <p>
                    <bad_health>A person isn’t easily satisfied, one moment he finds things far too
                        good and the next he’s not satisfied enough. But I’m saying this by the by,
                        we would do better not to talk about it, but rather continue quietly on our
                        way.</bad_health> Have a good Sunday morning, and give my regards to
                    everyone at the Rooses’, also to Mr and Mrs Tersteeg and Betsy, and in thought a
                    handshake from</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Thanks for your letter; I also like ‘Tell me the old, old story’ very much. I
                    first heard it sung in Paris, in the evening in a small church I used to attend
                    sometimes. No. 12 is also beautiful. I regret not having gone to hear Moody and
                    Sankey when they were in London. There’s such a yearning for Religion among the
                    people in those big cities. Many a worker in a factory or shop has had a
                    remarkable, pure, pious youth. But city life often takes away ‘the early dew of
                    morning’, yet the yearning for ‘the old, old story’ remains, the bottom of one’s
                    heart remains the bottom of one’s heart. In one of his books, Eliot describes
                    the life of factory workers &amp;c. who have joined a small community and hold
                    religious services in a chapel in ‘Lantern Yard’, and he says it is ‘God’s
                    Kingdom upon earth’, nothing more nor less.</p>
                <p>And there’s something moving about seeing the thousands now flocking to hear
                    those evangelists.</p>
                <p>I think your plan to give Pa and Ma ‘After the departure’ by Sadée is very good;
                    that’s agreed, then.</p>
                <p>Willemien may be already there on 21 May. I see from your letter that you’re also
                    thinking of going. Do it, old boy, if you can manage it. Sometimes such actions
                    receive a special blessing. How it would surprise them.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="family">There was something wistful in Ma’s last letter, in
                        which she wrote a word or two about the necessity of our being so far from
                        home. And Ma’s eyes are hurting her again.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>Come on, old boy, brighten them up again by being there on that day.</p>
                <p>This afternoon Mr Reid sent me the catalogue of the exhibition in London.</p>
                <p>In thought a handshake, and congratulations on the birthdays of Lies and Cor, and
                    also on 21 May. Regards to everyone at the Rooses’. In haste.</p>

            <body>
                <p>Bully for you, being in Etten on 21 May, happily there were 4 of the 6 at home.
                    Pa wrote to me in detail about everything that happened that day. Thanks, too,
                    for your last letter.</p>
                <p>Have I already written to you about the storm I saw recently? The sea was
                    yellowish, especially close to the beach; a streak of light on the horizon and,
                    above this, tremendously huge dark grey clouds from which one saw the rain
                    coming down in slanting streaks. The wind blew the dust from the small white
                    path on the rocks into the sea and tossed the blossoming hawthorn bushes and
                    wallflowers that grow on the rocks.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="environment">On the right, fields of young green wheat, and,
                        in the distance, the town with its towers, mills, slate roofs and houses
                        built in Gothic style, and, below, the harbour between the 2 jetties running
                        out into the sea, looking like the cities Albrecht Dürer used to etch. I
                        also saw the sea last Sunday night, everything was dark grey, but day was
                        beginning to break on the horizon. It was still very early, and yet a lark
                        was already singing. And the nightingales in the gardens on the seafront. In
                        the distance the light of the lighthouse, the guardship &amp;c.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>That same night I looked out of the window of my room onto the roofs of the
                    houses one sees from there and the tops of the elms, dark against the night sky.
                    Above those roofs, one single star, but a nice, big friendly one. <stress
                        reason="family">And I thought of us all, and I thought of the years of my
                        life that had already passed, and of our home, and the words and feeling
                        came to me, ‘Keep me from being a son that causeth shame, give me Your
                        blessing, not because I deserve it, but for my Mother’s sake. Thou art Love,
                        beareth all things. Without your constant blessing we can do
                        nothing.’</stress>
                </p>
                <p>Herewith a little drawing of the view from the school window where the boys stand
                    and watch their parents going back to the station after a visit. Many a boy will
                    never forget the view from that window. <unstress reason="environment">You
                        should have seen it this week when we had rainy days, especially in the
                        twilight when the streetlamps are being lit and their light is reflected in
                        the wet street.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>Mr Stokes was sometimes moody during those days, and when the boys were too
                    boisterous for him it sometimes happened that they didn’t get their bread and
                    tea in the evening. You should have seen them then, standing at the window
                    looking out, it was really rather sad. They have so little apart from their food
                    and drink to look forward to and to get them through the day. I’d also like you
                    to see them going down the dark stairs and small corridor to table. On that,
                    however, the friendly sun shines.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="environment">Another extraordinary place is the room with the
                        rotten floor where there are 6 basins at which they wash themselves, with
                        only a feeble light falling onto the washstand through a window with broken
                        panes. It’s quite a melancholy sight, to be sure. How I’d like to spend or
                        to have spent a winter with them, to know what it’s like.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>The youngsters are making an oil stain on your little drawing, forgive them.
                    Herewith a few words for Uncle Jan. </p>
                <p>And now goodnight, if anyone should ask after me bid them goodday. Do you still
                    visit Borchers once in a while? Give him my regards if you see him, and also
                    Willem Valkis and everyone at the Rooses’. A handshake in thought from</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Last Monday I left Ramsgate for London. That’s a long walk indeed, and when I
                    left it was awfully hot and it remained so until the evening, when I arrived at
                    Canterbury. <unstress reason="environment">That same evening I walked a bit
                        further until I came to a couple of large beeches and elms next to a small
                        pond, where I rested for a while. In the morning at half past 3 the birds
                        began to sing upon seeing the morning twilight, and I continued on my way.
                        It was good to walk then. In the afternoon I arrived at Chatham, where, in
                        the distance, past partly flooded, low-lying meadows, with elms here and
                        there, one sees the Thames full of ships. It’s always grey weather there, I
                        think.</unstress> There I met a cart that brought me a couple of miles
                    further, but then the driver went into an inn and I thought he might stay there
                    a long time, so I walked on and arrived towards evening in the well-known
                    suburbs of London and walked on towards the city down the long, long ‘Roads’. I
                    stayed in London for two days and often ran from one end of the city to the
                    other in order to see various people, including a minister to whom I’d written.
                    Herewith a translation of the letter, <bad_health>I’m sending it to you because
                        you should know that the feeling I have as I start out is ‘Father, I am not
                        worthy!’ and ‘Father be merciful to me!’</bad_health> Should I find anything
                    it will probably be a situation somewhere between minister and missionary, in
                    the suburbs of London among working folk. Don’t speak about this to anyone,
                    Theo. <stress reason="money">My salary at Mr Stokes’s will be very small.
                        Probably only board and lodging and some free time in which to teach, or if
                        there’s no free time, at most 20 pounds a year.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>But to continue: <unstress reason="friendship">I spent one night at Mr Reid’s and
                        the next at Mr Gladwell’s, where they were very, very kind. Mr Gladwell
                        kissed me good-night and that did me good, may it be granted me sometime in
                        the future to show some more friendship to his son every now and
                        then.</unstress> I wanted to leave for Welwyn that evening, but they
                    literally held me back by force because of the pouring rain. However, when it
                    had let up somewhat, around 4 in the morning, I set out for Welwyn. First a long
                    walk from one end of the city to the other, something like 10 miles (each taking
                    20 minutes). In the afternoon at 5, I was with our sister and was very glad to
                    see her. She looks well and you would be as pleased with her room as I am, with
                    ‘Good Friday’, ‘Christ in the Garden of Olives’, ‘Mater Dolorosa’ &amp;c. with
                    ivy around them instead of frames. Old boy, when you read my letter to that
                    minister you’ll perhaps say: he’s not so bad after all, though in fact he is.
                    Think of him as he is, however, every once in a while. A handshake in thought

                <p>Rev. Sir.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="career">A clergyman’s son, who, because he must work to earn a
                        living, has no money and no time to study at King’s College, and who,
                        besides that, is already a couple of years older than is usual for someone
                        starting there, and has not even begun on the preparatory studies of Latin
                        and Greek, would, in spite of everything, dearly like to find a situation
                        connected with the church, even though the position of a clergyman who has
                        had college training is beyond his reach.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>My father is a clergyman in a village in Holland. When I was 11 years old I
                    started going to school and stayed there until I was 16. At that time I had to
                    choose a profession and didn’t know what to choose. Through the offices of one
                    of my uncles, an associate in the firm of Goupil &amp; Co., art dealers and
                    publishers of engravings, I was given a position in his branch at The Hague. I
                    worked for the firm for 3 years. From there I went to London to learn English,
                    and after 2 years from there to Paris. Forced by various circumstances to quit
                    the firm, however, I left Messrs G.&amp;Co. and have since taught for 2 months
                    at Mr Stokes’s school at Ramsgate. As my goal is a situation connected with the
                    church, however, I must look further. Although I have not been trained for the
                    church, perhaps my past life of travelling, living in various countries,
                    associating with a variety of people, rich and poor, religious and not
                    religious, working at a variety of jobs, days of manual labour in between days
                    of office work &amp;c., perhaps also my speaking various languages, will
                    compensate in part for my lack of formal training. But what I should prefer to
                    give as my reason for commending myself to you is my innate love of the church
                    and that which concerns the church, which has at times lain dormant, though it
                    awakened repeatedly, and – if I may say so, <good_health>despite feelings of
                        great inadequacy and shortcoming – the Love of God and of
                        humankind.</good_health> And also, when I think of my past life and of my
                    father’s house in that Dutch village, <bad_health>a feeling of ‘Father, I have
                        sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called
                        thy son, make me as one of thy hired servants. Be merciful to
                        me.’</bad_health> When I was living in London I often attended your church
                    and I have not forgotten you. Now I am asking you for a recommendation in my

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Your letter and the prints came as a wonderful surprise this morning while I was
                    weeding the potatoes in the garden. I thank you; the two engravings, Christus
                    Consolator and Remunerator, are already hanging above my readingdesk in my room.
                    God is just, so He will use persuasion to bring those who stray back to the
                    straight path, that’s what you were thinking of when you wrote, may it come to
                    pass. <bad_health>I’m straying in many ways, but there’s still hope. Don’t worry
                        about your wanton life, as you call it, just go quietly on your way. You’re
                        purer than I, and will probably get there sooner and better.</bad_health>
                </p>
                <p>Don’t have too great illusions about the freedom I have; <bad_health>I have my
                        bonds of various kinds, humiliating bonds some of them, and this will only
                        get worse with time;</bad_health>
                    <good_health>but the words inscribed above Christus Consolator, ‘He is come to
                        preach deliverance to the captives’, are still true today.</good_health> Now
                    I have a request to make of you. Back then in The Hague I went to a catechist,
                    Hillen, who was living in Bagijnestraat at the time. He took great pains over me
                    and, although I didn’t show it, what he said made an impression on me, and I
                    have a mind to write a word or two to him, perhaps it would give him
                    pleasure.</p>
                <p>Go and find him if you have the time and can discover his address, and tell him
                    that I’ve become a schoolmaster and, who knows, may later find some kind of
                    situation connected with the church. He’s a very modest man, one who has
                    struggled a lot, I believe; sometimes when I went to see him and took a look at
                    him I couldn’t help thinking that the end of that man will be peace.</p>
                <p>
                    <work mention="vague">And give him the enclosed drawing for me.</work>
                </p>
                <p>How much I’d like to look in on Mauve sometime, what you describe, what you saw
                    the evening you were there, I can picture clearly, as it were. Do write again
                    soon, I wish you well, and believe me</p>

                <p>Please give my regards to Mr Tersteeg and his wife and Betsy, and to everyone at
                    the Rooses’, and anyone else you might see. Don’t tell them about me, though.
                    Tell Jan and Piet I bid them goodday as well. As you see, I’ve ended up at the
                    other school after all, herewith two prospectuses. If you can recommend the
                    school to anyone wishing to send their boys to England, then do so.</p>

            <body>
                <p>I heard from home that you’d be coming home for a day while Anna and Lies were
                    still there; write and tell me if that happened.</p>
                <p>Mr Jones came home yesterday, and his family, I’d made the boys’ dining room
                    green with Welcome home on the wall in holly and ivy and large bouquets on the
                    table. There’s a lot of holly in the garden here, and a few old trees have had
                    all their branches chopped off. These are now full of new branches, pure white
                    or yellowish, with a small pink leaf here and there, which is absolutely
                    beautiful, I picked a large bunch of them to put on the table.</p>
                <p>Mr Jones asked me if I could find out how much 50 pounds of butter would cost in
                    Holland; if it isn’t too expensive he’s thinking about always having it sent
                    from Holland. Ask Mrs Roos about it sometime, and write and tell me as soon as
                    possible.</p>
                <p>The boys will also be coming soon.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="environment">Have you ever read the story of Elijah and Elisha
                        properly? I’ve been reading it again these last few days, and am enclosing
                        what I’ve copied out. It’s so movingly beautiful. Similarly, I’ve also been
                        reading in Acts about Paul, how he stood on the seashore, and they fell on
                        his neck, and kissed him, and those words of Paul moved me, ‘God comforteth
                        the simple’. It is God who makes men and who can enrich life with moments
                        and times of higher life and loftier feeling. The sea may have made itself,
                        or an oak tree itself, but men like Pa are purer than the sea. The sea is
                        beautiful all the same; there were lots of bedbugs at Mr Stokes’s, but that
                        view from the school window made one forget them.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>The heart of a man of flesh and blood ‘sometimes faints from earnest longing’
                    upon seeing those who devote themselves to and work for Him who baptized them,
                    as it were, with the Holy Ghost, and with fire, and they – look, their eyes
                    sometimes grow moist with tears of wistfulness as they think back on their young
                    years and on ‘the good things with which He satisfied them’. Yet their exalted
                    peace is better than the deceptive peace of bygone days. True rest and peace
                    begin only ‘when there is nothing more in which to rest’ and when there is ‘none
                    upon earth they desire beside God’. Then there is a ‘woe is me’ in them, and a
                    beseeching ‘who shall deliver me from the body of this death’, and yet that is
                    the best time of life, and blessed are they who reach that high peak.</p>
                <p>I’ve heard two men say that, one in Paris, the Rev. Bersier, who, out of fear of
                    a great bodily suffering that awaited him, exclaimed during his sermon, ‘Who
                    shall deliver me of this dead body’ in a tone of voice that I believe made
                    everyone in the church tremble. And I heard Pa say it (when I was home in April,
                    in his sermon), but he said it in a soft voice, though it had a keener edge than
                    the other, and he followed it with (and his countenance was like that of an
                    angel) ‘the blessed above, they say “what you are now, I used to be: what I am
                    now, you will one day be”’. <unstress reason="family">Between Pa and those above
                        there is still a part of life, between us and Pa there is also still life.
                        He above can make us Pa’s brothers and can also join us intimately to one
                        another, more so every day, may it be so, for I have a need to remain your
                        brother, old boy, surely you know how much I love you!</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>May I succeed and get some firm ground beneath my feet.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="environment">Yesterday I took a lovely walk along the Thames;
                        on the other side there were splendid villas with their gardens. It was a
                        sky like Ruisdael or Constable paint it.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>And now a handshake in thought, give my regards to everyone at the Rooses’. How
                    is Willem doing? And give my regards to Borchers, too, if you happen to see him,

                <p>The word of the Lord came unto Elijah the Tishbite, saying, Get thee hence, and
                    turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith, that is before
                    Jordan. And it shall be, that thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have
                    commanded the ravens to feed thee there. He so went and did according unto the
                    word of the Lord: for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that is before
                    Jordan. And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and
                    flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook.</p>
                <p>And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up, because there had
                    been no rain in the land. And the word of the Lord came unto him, saying, Arise,
                    get thee to Zarephath, which belongeth to Zidon, and dwell there: behold, I have
                    commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee. So he arose and went to
                    Zarephath. And when he came to the gate of the city, behold, the widow woman was
                    there gathering of sticks: and he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray
                    thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink. And as she was going to
                    fetch it, he called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread
                    in thine hand. And she said, As the Lord thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but
                    an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse! and, behold, I am
                    gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we
                    may eat it, and die. And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go and do as thou hast
                    said: but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it unto me, and after
                    make for thee and for thy son. For thus saith the Lord God of Israel, The barrel
                    of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that
                    the Lord sendeth rain upon the earth. And she went and did according to the
                    saying of Elijah: and she, and he, and her house, did eat many days. And the
                    barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the
                    word of the Lord, which he spake to Elijah. And it came to pass after these
                    things, that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his
                    sickness was so sore, that there was no breath left in him. And she said unto
                    Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou man of God? art thou come unto me to
                    call my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son? And he said unto her, Give me
                    thy son. And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into a loft, where
                    he abode, and laid him upon his own bed. And he cried unto the Lord, and said, O
                    Lord my God! hast Thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by
                    slaying her son? And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried
                    unto the Lord, and said, O Lord my God, I pray thee, let this child’s soul come
                    into him again. And the Lord heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the
                    child came into him again, and he revived. And Elijah took the child, and
                    brought him down out of the chamber into the house, and delivered him unto his
                    mother: and Elijah said, See, thy son liveth. And the woman said to Elijah, Now
                    by this I know that thou art a man of God, and that the word of the Lord in thy
                    mouth is truth.And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto
                    him, Art thou he that troubleth Israel? And he answered, I have not troubled
                    Israel; but thou, and thy father’s house, in that ye have forsaken the
                    commandments of the Lord, and thou hast followed Baalim. Now therefore send, and
                    gather to me all Israel unto mount Carmel, and the prophets of the groves four
                    hundred, which eat at Jezebel’s table, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and
                    fifty. So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets
                    together unto mount Carmel. And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How
                    long halt ye between two opinions? if the Lord be God, follow Him: but if Baal
                    is God, then follow him! And the people answered him not a word. Then said
                    Elijah unto the people, I, even I only, remain a prophet of the Lord; but Baal’s
                    prophets are four hundred and fifty men. Let them therefore give us two
                    bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces,
                    and lay it on wood, and put no fire under: and I will dress the other bullock,
                    and lay it on wood, and put no fire under: And call ye on the name of your Gods,
                    and I will call on the name of the Lord: and the God that answereth by fire, let
                    him be God. And all the people answered and said, It is well spoken. And Elijah
                    said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock for yourselves, and dress
                    it first; for ye are many; and call on the name of your Gods, but put no fire
                    under. And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed it, and
                    called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear
                    us! But there was no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped upon the
                    altar which was made. And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and
                    said, Cry aloud: for he is a God; but he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is
                    in a journey, or peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awaked. And they cried
                    aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the
                    blood gushed out upon them. And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they
                    prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that there
                    was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.</p>
                <p>And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me. And all the people came
                    near unto him. And he repaired the altar of the Lord that was broken down. And
                    Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of
                    Jacob, unto whom the word of the Lord came, saying, Israel shall be thy name:
                    And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the Lord: and he made a
                    trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed. And he
                    put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid him on the wood,
                    and said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour on the burnt sacrifice, and on
                    the wood. And he said, Do it the second time. And he said, Do it the third time.
                    And they did it the third time, so that the water ran round about the altar; and
                    he filled the trench also with water. And it came to pass at the time of the
                    offering of the evening sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said,
                    Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel! let it be known this day that Thou
                    art God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that I have done all these
                    things at thy word. Hear me, O Lord, hear me, that this people may know that
                    Thou art the Lord God! and that thou hast turned their heart back again. Then
                    the fire of the Lord fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and
                    the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench. And
                    when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and they said, The Lord,
                    he is the God; the Lord, he is the God. And Elijah said unto them, Take the
                    prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape. And they took them: and Elijah
                    brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there. And Elijah said unto
                    Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink; for there is a sound as of abundance of rain.
                    So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel;
                    and he cast himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees, And
                    said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went up, and looked,
                    and said, There is nothing. And he said, Go again seven times. And it came to
                    pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there ariseth a little cloud out
                    of the sea, like a man’s hand. And he said, Go up, say unto Ahab, Prepare thy
                    chariot, and get thee down, that the rain stop thee not. And it came to pass in
                    the mean while, that the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a
                    great rain. And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel. And the hand of the Lord was on
                    Elijah; and he girded up his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of
                    Jezreel.And Elijah went a day’s journey into the wilderness, and came and sat
                    down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himself that he might die; and
                    said, It is enough; now, O Lord! take away my life; for I am not better than my
                    fathers. And as he lay and slept under a juniper tree, behold, then an angel
                    touched him, and said unto him, Arise and eat. And he looked, and, behold, there
                    was a cake baken on the coals, and a cruse of water at his head. And he did eat
                    and drink, and laid him down again. And the Angel of the Lord came again the
                    second time, and again touched him, and said, Arise and eat! because the journey
                    is too great for thee. And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the
                    strength of the meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of God.
                    And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and, behold, the word of the
                    Lord came to him, and he said unto him, What doest thou here, Elijah? And he
                    said, I have been very jealous for the Lord God of hosts: for the children of
                    Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy
                    prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to
                    take it away. And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the Lord.
                    And, behold, the Lord passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains,
                    and brake in pieces the rocks, going before the Lord; but the Lord was not in
                    the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but the Lord was not in the
                    earthquake: And after the earthquake a fire; but the Lord was not in the fire:
                    and after the fire a still small voice. And it was so, when Elijah heard it,
                    that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entering
                    in of the cave.And it came to pass, when the Lord would take up Elijah into
                    heaven by a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal. And Elijah said
                    unto Elisha, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the Lord hath sent me to Bethel. And
                    Elisha said unto him, As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not
                    leave thee! So they went down to Bethel. And the sons of the prophets that were
                    at Bethel came forth to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Lord
                    will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he said, Yea, I know it;
                    hold ye your peace. And Elijah said unto him, Elisha! tarry here, I pray thee;
                    for the Lord hath sent me to Jericho. And he said, As the Lord liveth, and as
                    thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee! So they came to Jericho. And the sons of
                    the prophets that were at Jericho came to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest
                    thou that the Lord will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he
                    answered, Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace.And Elijah said unto him, Tarry, I
                    pray thee, here; for the Lord hath sent me to Jordan. And he said, As the Lord
                    liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And they two went on. And
                    fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to view afar off: and they
                    two stood by Jordan. And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and
                    smote the waters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that they two
                    went over on dry ground. And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that
                    Elijah said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be taken away
                    from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be
                    upon me. And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: nevertheless, if thou see me
                    when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not be
                    so.</p>
                <p>And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there
                    appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder;
                    and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.</p>
                <p>And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father! my Father, the chariot of Israel, and
                    the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own
                    clothes, and rent them in two pieces. He took up also the mantle of Elijah that
                    fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of Jordan; and he took the
                    mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where is
                    the Lord God of Elijah? and when he also had smitten the waters, they parted
                    hither and thither: and Elisha went over.‘And now, brethren, I commend you to
                    God, and to the word of His grace, which is able to build you up, and to give
                    you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified. I have coveted no man’s
                    silver, or gold, or apparel. Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have
                    ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me. I have shewed you
                    all things, how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak, and to remember
                    the words of the Lord Jesus, how He said, It is more blessed to give than to
                    receive.’ And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with them
                    all. And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul’s neck, and kissed him, Sorrowing
                    most of all for the words which he spake, that they should see his face no more.

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Yesterday I went to see Gladwell, who’s home for a few days. <stress
                        reason="friendship">Something very sad happened to his family: his sister, a
                        girl full of life, with dark eyes and hair, 17 years old, fell from her
                        horse while riding on Blackheath. She was unconscious when they picked her
                        up, and died 5 hours later without regaining consciousness.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>I went there as soon as I heard what had happened and that Gladwell was at home.
                    I left here yesterday morning at 11 o’clock, and had a long walk to Lewisham,
                    the road went from one end of London to the other. At 5 o’clock I was at
                    Gladwell’s. I’d gone to their gallery first, but it was closed.</p>
                <p>
                    <good_health>They had all just come back from the funeral, it was a real house
                        of mourning and it did me good to be there. I had feelings of embarrassment
                        and shame at seeing that deep, estimable grief, for these people are
                        estimable.</good_health> Blessed are they that mourn, blessed are they that
                    are ‘sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing’, blessed are the pure in heart, for God
                    comforts the simple. Blessed are they that find Love on their path, who are
                    bound intimately with one another by God, for to them all things work together
                    for good. I talked with Harry for a long time, until the evening, about all
                    kinds of things, about the kingdom of God and about his Bible, and we walked up
                    and down on the station, talking, and those moments before parting we’ll
                    probably never forget.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="friendship">We know each other so well, his work was my work,
                        the people he knows there I know too, his life was my life, and it was given
                        to me to see so deeply into their family affairs, I think, because I believe
                        that I love them, not so much because I know the particulars of those
                        affairs, but because I feel the tone and feeling of their being and
                        life.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>So we walked back and forth on that station, in that everyday world, but with a
                    feeling that was not everyday.</p>
                <p>They don’t last long, such moments, and we soon had to take leave of each other.
                        <unstress reason="environment">It was a beautiful sight, looking out from
                        the train over London, that lay there in the dark, St Paul’s and other
                        churches in the distance. I stayed in the train until Richmond and walked
                        along the Thames to Isleworth, that was a lovely walk, on the left the parks
                        with their tall poplars, oaks and elms, on the right the river, reflecting
                        the tall trees. It was a beautiful, almost solemn, evening;</unstress> I got
                    home at quarter past 10.</p>
                <p>Thanks for your last letter. You hadn’t yet written that Mrs Vintcent had died;
                    how often I brought her home in the evenings. Do you still visit Borchers
                    sometimes? How I’d like to have walked with you to Hoeven! I often teach the
                    boys biblical history, and last Sunday I read the Bible with them. Mornings and
                    evenings we all read the Bible and sing and pray, and that is good. We did that
                    at Ramsgate, too, and when those 21 sons of the London markets and streets
                    prayed ‘Our Father, who art in Heaven, give us this day our daily bread’,
                        <good_health>I’ve sometimes thought of the cry of the young ravens that the
                        Lord hears, and it did me good to pray with them and to bow my head,
                        probably even lower than they did, at the words Do not lead us into
                        temptation but deliver us from evil.</good_health>
                </p>
                <p>I’m still full of yesterday; it must be good to be the brother of the man I saw
                    so sorrowful yesterday, I mean that it must ‘be blessed to mourn’ with manly
                    sorrow, how I’d have liked to comfort the Father, but I was embarrassed, though
                    I could talk to the son. There was something hallowed in that house
                    yesterday.</p>
                <p>Have you ever read ‘A life for a life’, I think in Dutch it’s called ‘Uit het
                    leven voor het leven’, by the woman who wrote John Halifax? You’d find it very
                    beautiful. How’s your English coming along?</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="environment">It was a delight to take a long walk
                        again,</unstress> very little walking is done here at school.
                        <bad_health>When I think of my life of struggle in Paris last year and now
                        here, where sometimes I can’t leave the house for a whole day, or at least
                        no further than the garden, then I sometimes think, when will I return to
                        that world?</bad_health> If I do return to it, though, it will probably be
                    some other kind of work than I did last year. <good_health>But I think that I
                        prefer doing biblical history with the boys to walking; one feels more or
                        less safe doing the former.</good_health>
                </p>
                <p>And now, regards to everyone at the Rooses’, and if anyone else should ask after
                    me. How are the Van den Berghs, and the Van Stockums on Buitenhof? Do you ever
                    hear anything from them? A handshake in thought and best wishes from</p>

            <sig>Vincent</sig>
            <ps>
                <p>And herewith a letter for Mauve. You may read it, I believe it’s good not to
                    forget one’s old acquaintances, that’s why I’m writing again to some of them,
                    also those in Paris, to Soek and others. If you can persuade anyone to read
                    Scenes from clerical life by Eliot, and Felix Holt, you’ll be doing a good deed.
                    The former is a wonderful book. Recommend the former to Caroline and to the
                    Mauves and, if possible, to Mr Tersteeg as well.Could you write by return of
                    post saying whether a Dutch pound of butter costs 80 cents and – if it’s a
                    different pound – what part of a kilo is it then?Also give my regards to Mr and
                    Mrs Tersteeg and Betsy.</p>
                <p>I’m writing to you between school hours and rather in haste, as you can see.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Thanks for your letter of this morning. There are hours and days and times in
                    life when God hides His face, as it were, but for those who love God even those
                    times, those sorrowful times, are not entirely without God, but as though full
                    of prophecies for the future and full of voices from the past: ‘hitherto hath
                    the Lord brought you’, ‘foster again the faith of old’.</p>
                <p>If things should sometimes happen to you that you hadn’t counted on, strengthen
                    within yourself the godly sorrow and the voice: ‘Abba, Father’.</p>
                <p>It was an autumn day and I stood on the front steps of Mr Provily’s school,
                    watching the carriage drive away that Pa and Ma rode home in.</p>
                <p>One could see that yellow carriage in the distance on the long road – wet after
                    the rain, with thin trees on either side – running through the meadows. The grey
                    sky above it all was reflected in the puddles. <unstress reason="family">And
                        around a fortnight later I was standing one evening in a corner of the
                        playground when they came to tell me that someone was asking after me, and I
                        knew who it was and a moment later I flung my arms round Father’s neck. What
                        I felt, wouldn’t it have been ‘because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the
                        spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying in us, “Abba, Father”’? It was a
                        moment in which we both felt that we have a Father in heaven; because my
                        Father, too, looked up and in his heart there was an even bigger voice than
                        mine crying ‘Abba, Father’.</unstress>Between that moment and today are
                    years of pilgrimage. There are words that accompany us and grow up with us, as
                    it were – which are, ‘sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing’. There is the prayer of a
                    Mother for her children which is very powerful, for the prayer of a righteous
                    person availeth much.Father, I pray not that Thou shouldest take them out of the
                    world, but that Thou shouldest keep them from the evil.There is the hand of a
                    faithful Father that blessed us when we left the family home.</p>
                <p>And then, old boy, as I said earlier, there is a strong yearning for the day when
                    He will no longer remember the iniquities of our youth. Who rejoices in grey
                    hair?</p>
                <p>As far as the east is from the west, so far do I remove your transgressions from
                    you. Though your sins be as scarlet, I shall make them white as snow.</p>
                <p>He who hate not his own life, he cannot be Christ’s disciple. Pa once sent me
                    this:A longing for sanctificationWho shall free us fully and for ever</p>
                <p>From the body of this death, bent beneath the yoke?</p>
                <p>How long must I still combat my nature</p>
                <p>Ere this heart from sinful service be revoked?That God my God would be, I pledged
                    my troth </p>
                <p>With singleness of mind Him would I follow</p>
                <p>But I was tried – forgotten was my oath I was tempted – and my foot did
                    falter.No, with my own strength I shan’t learn to conquer</p>
                <p>Soul, confess your weakness, selfdeceit, take flight!</p>
                <p>A child’s heart must be shaped by the Father</p>
                <p>The Master be the pupil’s guiding light.Well then, Father, let your love be my
                    teacher</p>
                <p>My Master, take my hand, and show your standard</p>
                <p>I stood alone – and fell: now we’re together</p>
                <p>I succumbed, but win behind your vanguard.Only now do I feel strong, when with
                    weakness stricken</p>
                <p>Powerless in myself, but in the Lord, almighty!</p>
                <p>Sin may tempt, the evil passions quicken,</p>
                <p>Thou castest down all foes, O God in me!I am grieved, but it’s a godly
                    sadness</p>
                <p>A nightcloud – tinged all round with dawn’s bright crimson</p>
                <p>I weep, Lord, though my heart is full of gladness</p>
                <p>I bow my head – but, Father, in thy bosom.Who rejoices in grey hair? Who sees
                    behind it as Felix Holt saw behind the word ‘failure’? Who sees, when the first
                    life, the life of childhood and adolescence, that life of joy in the world and
                    vanity reluctantly withers, and it will wither, even as the blossom falls from
                    the trees, that then another life shoots up vigorously, the life of the love of
                    Christ that constraineth and godly sorrow not to be repented of; how then, in
                    our profound dependence on God, and in the clear and forceful feeling of this,
                    we find more favour in His eyes, which are too pure to behold evil, and how He
                    will entrust to us more safely, in our weakness, His Holy Spirit which giveth
                    life and constraineth unto good works. Who rejoices in the life ahead? Who
                    rejoices in grey hair, who rejoices in sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing,
                    chastened, but not killed until ‘dying, and, behold, we live’? Who rejoices in
                    falling down, and standing up again with longsuffering and meekness? Who
                    rejoices in the green of the pine trees and cedar and ivy and holly and moss in
                    the winter? Dry wood gives more heat, bright fire and light when it is lit than
                    green wood does. There is no fear in Love, but perfect love shutteth out
                    fear.Father in my great affliction,</p>
                <p>Father, who punishes and saves,</p>
                <p>Father, e’en in death’s own kingdom,</p>
                <p>Father, too, in the silent grave.</p>
                <p>Where’er I see inconstancy,</p>
                <p>God, Thou takest a firm stand.</p>
                <p>My dust, too, rests in Thy loyalty</p>
                <p>And slumbers in Thy fatherly hand.Years, go quickly, fly by swiftly</p>
                <p>With your gladness and travail</p>
                <p>Whatever evil I bewail</p>
                <p>God, my God, He changeth not.Though we sit in mournful darkness</p>
                <p>That eternal light will blaze</p>
                <p>All its glory and resplendence</p>
                <p>Worthy of all laud and praise.I know in Whom my faith is founded,</p>
                <p>Though day and night change constantly,</p>
                <p>I know the rock on which I’m grounded,</p>
                <p>My Saviour waits, unfailingly.</p>
                <p>When once life’s evening overcomes me,</p>
                <p>Worn down by ills and strife always,</p>
                <p>For every day Thou hast allowed me,</p>
                <p>I’ll bring Thee higher, purer praise.Why art thou cast down, my soul,</p>
                <p>Disquieted in me, oh why?</p>
                <p>Foster again the faith of old,</p>
                <p>Rejoice in praising Him most high.</p>
                <p>Oft hath He taken your distress</p>
                <p>And turned it into happiness.</p>
                <p>Hope in Him, eyes heavenward raised,</p>
                <p>For to my God I still give praise.And above all things have fervent charity among
                    yourselves: for charity shall cover the multitude of sins.The good Lord blesses
                    love’s dwellingplace,</p>
                <p>He dwelleth there, there one obtains His grace,</p>
                <p>and life everlasting.Let us have Love toward one another, so that God may
                    increase and strengthen our Love, and let us have love toward those around us,
                    and if sometimes there are no people whom you can love enough, love the town you
                    live in, as you certainly do, don’t I love Paris and London even though I’m a
                    child of the pinewoods and of that beach at Ramsgate?</p>
                <p>And seek to please the poor, and to find favour in their eyes.</p>
                <p>‘Stablish your heart’. ‘Because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of
                    His Son into our hearts, crying in us, “Abba, Father”’.</p>
                <p>He that hath not loved knoweth not God; for God is Love. And this is life
                    eternal, to know God, and Christ, Whom He hath sent. There is no fear in
                    love.</p>
                <p>In my Father’s house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told
                    you.</p>
                <p>And yet I am not alone, but the Father is with me. It is better to trust in the
                    Lord than to put confidence in man. It is better to fall into the hand of the
                    Lord than into the hand of man.</p>
                <p>Let Christ be the centre of your longing, the Comforter of a troubled mind.</p>
                <p> ‘Stablish your heart’ in this sense, too: eat your bread with singleness of
                    heart, I do so at least, I cannot do otherwise, God help me, if there be any
                    danger in doing it; ‘Father, into thy hands I commend my heart’, eat your bread
                    but live simply, and smoke your pipe, I do it too, whenever I have some tobacco
                    and take a walk, I do it too whenever I get the chance to break loose. ‘And
                    commit thy way unto the Lord; He shall bring it to pass’.‘Stablish your Love’.
                    What exactly is the Love of which Paul speaks? What exactly are those wonderful
                    words which you also know, 1 Cor. XIII. That Love is the life in Christ, that
                    love is our Mother, all the goodness of the earth belongs to her, for everything
                    is good if enjoyed with thanksgiving, but she extends much further than that
                    goodness of the earth. To her belongs a drink from the brook during a walk or
                    from a fountain in the hot streets of London and Paris, to her also belongs ‘I
                    shall make your bed in sickness’, ‘as one whom his Mother comforteth, so will I
                    comfort you’, to her also belongs faithfulness until death in Christ who gives
                    us the strength to do all things. There is a friend that sticketh closer than a
                    brother.</p>
                <p>‘Stablish your hope’, for there is much that is good in life, for him who loves
                    Christ the world is what it is, and all things shall be added unto him, as it
                    were. It is indeed true that much joy already lies behind us, and also much that
                    we used to look forward to, and although much joy may lie in store for us, we
                    have already seen that ‘the world passeth away, and all the glory thereof’. And
                    if it be true that:<good_health>I’ve found a joy in sorrow, a secret balm for
                        pain,</good_health>
                </p>
                <p>A beautiful tomorrow of sunshine after rain;</p>
                <p>I’ve found a branch of healing near every bitter spring,</p>
                <p>A whispered promise stealing o’er every broken string.then it’s also true that
                    there is no joy without insufficiency.</p>
                <p>Sorrow is better than joy, and it is better to go to the house of mourning than
                    to the house of feasts, for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made
                    better.</p>
                <p>Even in mirth the heart is sad.</p>
                <p>For myself I shall endeavour to strive to love Christ and to work for Him in my
                    life, even if it fails and even if I fall, there will always remain a standing
                    aloof and a longing for above from the misery below. But I want to seek faith
                    and Love and to continue asking for God’s spirit under all circumstances.</p>
                <p>Now this is my vow to the Lord my God, my rock. If I am forsaken, then I am
                    forsaken, but He is faithful and loves with an eternal Love and grants us our
                    heart’s desire of being Evergreen. Read the prophecies of Isaiah and Jeremiah,
                    Isa. 9, 11, 35; Isa. 40, 42, 43, 44, 45:2 and the following verses, 49, 53, 55,
                    58, 61, 63, 65; Jer. 3, 17, 30, 31. </p>
                <p>The Lord is thy keeper, The Lord is thy shade upon thy right hand. Unto Him
                    belong the issues from death, with Him is everlasting life.</p>
                <p>My boy, days will come when we’ll no longer believe because we heard it said but
                    when we’ll know, feel and love it. Then we’ll be moved to hear the name of God
                    spoken, just as we’re moved to see our father again after a long time away from
                    home.</p>
                <p>And we’ll be brothers and sisters and children of the parsonage, as though made
                    new, and in manifold ways.</p>
                <p>Let us continue in life as long as our legs will carry us, even though our feet
                    grow tired, and the oppression great, and even if our ears buzz with the sound
                    of the world that they have been hearing for so many years, and even if our
                    whole head is tired, and the going is difficult, <unstress reason="family">let
                        us continue in life because our Father and our Mother tell us to ‘go forth
                        and don’t look back’, and if we can do good along the way, let us not
                        neglect to do so; and yet it is more our heart than our work that God
                        desires. Pa and Ma say ‘go forth’ and they love us, didn’t Pa say: my boy,
                        surely you know that I would give my last shirt for you.</unstress> Let us
                    continue as long as our legs will carry us (and you will find that God giveth
                    power to the faint; and increaseth strength to him that has no might, that God
                    supports) for there is greater Love in store, that is why we rejoice and have
                    faith in that life ahead.</p>
                <p>A handshake in thought, it’s already late, adieu.</p>

                    as though he were a person from another world, so much lies between the time

            <salutation>Dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>I heard from home that you were ill. How much I’d like to be with you, my boy.
                    Yesterday evening I walked over to Richmond and I thought about you the whole
                    way, it was a beautiful, grey evening, you know that I go there every Monday
                    evening to the Methodist church, yesterday evening I even said a few words on
                    ‘Nothing pleaseth me but in Jesus Christ, and in Him all things please me’.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="family">How I’d like to be with you, though, oh why are we all
                        so far apart? But what shall we do about it?</stress>
                </p>
                <p>I’m sending herewith a letter from the aunts at Zundert. You know that Aunt Bet
                    hurt herself so badly. I wrote and told them that, if possible, you and I would
                    walk to Zundert sometime at Christmas.</p>
                <p>Herewith I’m copying out a few psalms, you might like to read them at this time.
                    Write a few words soon if you can.</p>
                <p>A week ago on Saturday I made a long journey to London, <unstress reason="career"
                        >and there I heard about a situation that might be of future interest. The
                        clergymen in such seaside places as Liverpool and Hull, for example, often
                        have need of assistants who speak various languages to work among the seamen
                        and foreigners, and also to visit the sick. In addition, such a situation
                        would be salaried.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>I left here early that morning, 4 o’clock, that night it was beautiful in the
                    park here, with the dark avenues of elm trees and the wet road going through
                    them and the grey rainy sky above it all, and there was a thunderstorm in the
                    distance. When daylight came I was in Hyde Park, where the leaves were already
                    falling from the trees and the Virginia creeper was so magnificently red against
                    the houses, and it was foggy. <unstress reason="environment">At 7 o’clock I was
                        in Kennington, and rested there awhile in the church I had attended many a
                        Sunday evening. In London I visited one or two people and also went to the
                        gallery of Messrs Goupil &amp; Cie, and there I saw the drawings that Van
                        Iterson had brought, and it was a pleasure to see the Dutch cities and
                        meadows again. That painting by Artz, that mill on the canal, I find really
                        very beautiful.</unstress> You also have a good life ahead of you, Theo,
                    remain steadfast, and much light will come your way. Is Van Iterson back yet? I
                    was very glad indeed to see him again, he’s bringing you ‘De wijde wijde
                    wereld’, read it one of these days, the first chapters in particular are so
                    beautiful and so truly straightforward. And read Longfellow sometime, e.g.:I see
                    the lights of the village</p>
                <p>Gleam through the rain and the mist</p>
                <p>And a feeling of sadness comes o’er me</p>
                <p>That my soul cannot resistA feeling of sadness and longing</p>
                <p>That is not akin to pain</p>
                <p>And resembles sorrow only</p>
                <p>As the mist resembles the rainCome read to me some poem</p>
                <p>Some simple and heartfelt lay</p>
                <p>That shall soothe this restless feeling</p>
                <p>And banish the thoughts of day.Not from the grand old masters</p>
                <p>Not from the bards sublime</p>
                <p>Whose distant footsteps echo</p>
                <p>Through the corridors of timeRead from some humbler poet,</p>
                <p>Whose songs gushed from his heart</p>
                <p>As showers from the clouds of summer</p>
                <p>Or tears from the eyelids start.Who through long days of labour</p>

                    boy, remain steadfast and get well soon, and write soon about how you’re doing
                    and at the same time send back the aunts’ letter, poor Aunt Bet, what old
                    friends we are. Oh that Zundert, the thought of it’s almost too much at times.
                    Adieu, old boy, may God make us brothers more and more and join us intimately to
                    one another, and may the Love for Him make that bond ever stronger. Give my very
                    warm regards to Uncle Jan, I heard from Pa that Willem and Johan are doing very
                    well indeed. Give my regards, too, to everyone at the Rooses’, from</p>

                    <unstress reason="environment">Paris will also be beautiful now in the autumn,
                        last year Gladwell and I went every Sunday to as many friends and churches
                        as we could, we left in the morning and came home late. NotreDame is so
                        absolutely beautiful in the autumn evenings among the chestnut trees.
                        There’s something in Paris, though, that’s more beautiful than the autumn
                        and the churches, and that is the poor people there. I sometimes think of
                        many a person there.</unstress>

                <p>Psalm 23 </p>
                <p>The Lord is my Shepherd; I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green
                    pastures: He leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul: He
                    leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for His name’s sake.</p>
                <p>Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no
                    evil: for Thou art with me; Thy rod and Thy staff they comfort me. Thou
                    preparest a table before me: Thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth
                    over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: And I
                    will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.Psalm 91 </p>
                <p>He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the
                    shadow of the Almighty.</p>
                <p>I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I
                    trust. Surely He shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the
                    noisome pestilence. He shall cover thee with His wings, and under His wings
                    shalt thou trust: His truth shall be thy shield and buckler. Thou shalt not be
                    afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day; nor for
                    the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at
                    noonday. A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand;
                    but it shall not come nigh thee. Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see
                    the reward of the wicked. Because Thou hast made the Lord, which is my refuge,
                    even the most High, Thy habitation;</p>
                <p>There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling.
                    For He shall give his angels charge to keep thee in all thy ways. They shall
                    bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone. Thou shalt
                    tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample
                    under feet.</p>
                <p>Because he hath set his love upon Me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set
                    him on high, because he hath known My name. He shall call upon Me, and I will
                    answer him: I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour
                    him.</p>
                <p>With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation.Psalm 121 </p>
                <p>I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help.</p>
                <p>My help cometh from the Lord, which made Heaven and earth. He will not suffer thy
                    foot to be moved: he that keepeth thee will not slumber.</p>
                <p>Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.</p>
                <p>The Lord is thy keeper: the Lord is thy shade upon thy right hand.</p>
                <p>The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night.</p>
                <p>The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve thy soul.</p>
                <p>The Lord shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth, and

                    Rahel weeping for her children refused to be comforted for her children, because
                    they were not.</p>
                <p>Thus saith the Lord; Refrain thine eyes from tears, and thy voice from weeping,
                    for thy work shall be rewarded, and they shall come again from the land of the
                    enemy. But this shall be the covenant that I will make, saith the Lord, I will
                    write my law in their inward parts, and will be their God, and they shall be My
                    sons and daughters. And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and
                    every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for they shall all know Me, from
                    the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the Lord: for I will forgive

            <salutation>Dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>It’s Saturday again, and I’m writing a few words once more. <stress
                        reason="family">I’m longing so much to see you again, oh, I can long for it
                        so much sometimes.</stress> Do write soon and tell me how you are.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="environment">Last Wednesday afternoon we took a lovely walk to
                        a village an hour away from here. The road there goes through meadows and
                        fields, along hedgerows of hawthorn full of blackberries and clematis and
                        here and there a tall elm tree. It was so beautiful when the sun went down
                        behind the grey clouds and when the shadows were long, and we chanced to
                        meet Mr Stokes’s school, where there are still several boys I
                        know.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>The clouds kept their red glow long after the sun had set and the twilight was
                    gathering over the fields, and in the distance we saw the streetlamps being lit
                    in the village. <unstress reason="environment">This morning there was also a
                        beautiful sunrise. I see it every morning when I wake the boys
                        up.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="environment">Last night I opened that book by Souvestre again
                        (Le philosophe sous les toits), and I found such a friendly description of
                        Paris in it, a kind description; I copied it out for Pa and Ma, perhaps
                        you’ll like it too:</unstress>9 May. The beautiful evenings have returned;
                    the trees are beginning to uncurl their buds. Hyacinths, daffodils, violets and
                    lilacs scent the flowersellers’ stalls; the crowds have begun to stroll along
                    the quays and boulevards again. After supper, I too came down from my garret to
                    breathe the evening air. It is the hour when Paris shows herself in all her
                    beauty. During the day, the plaster of the facades fatigues the eye with its
                    monotonous whiteness, the heavily laden carts make the cobblestones shudder
                    under their huge wheels, the hurrying crowds cross and collide, intent on not
                    missing a moment of business; there is something harsh, anxious, breathless
                    about the city. But everything changes the moment the stars come out; the white
                    houses fade into misty shadow; nothing is to be heard but the wheels of
                    carriages as they bowl along on their way to some party or other; nothing is to
                    be seen but people strolling idly or gaily by; work gives way to leisure. Now
                    everyone draws breath from that fierce race through the day’s activities; what
                    strength remains is given over to pleasure! See the dancehalls lighting up their
                    colonnades, the theatres opening, the titbit stalls lining the avenues, the
                    newsvendors making their lanterns shine. Paris has clearly put aside the pen,
                    the ruler and the apron; after the day dedicated to work it wants to keep the
                    evening for enjoyment; like the masters of Thebes it has put off serious
                    business till the morrow. I love to share this festive time — not to take part
                    in the general gaiety but to observe it. The joy of others may embitter jealous
                    hearts, but it fortifies submissive hearts; it is the ray of sunshine that opens
                    up those two lovely flowers called ‘confidence’ and ‘hope’.Usually, the view
                    that opens before my window delights me. It is a clutter of roofs whose tops
                    overlap and crisscross, superimposed on one another, and upon which the tall
                    chimneys raise their peaks. Yesterday I still found something Alpine about them,
                    and waited for the first snow, to see glaciers on them; today I see nothing but
                    tiles and stovepipes. The pigeons that fed my rustic fantasies now seem no more
                    than poor feathered creatures that have taken the roofs for a farmyard; the
                    smoke that rises in faint wisps, instead of giving me dreams of the ventholes of
                    Vesuvius makes me think of cooking and dishwater; lastly, the telegraph that I
                    can see from afar, on the old tower of Montmartre, looks to me like a revolting
                    gallows whose arm rises above the city.In sorrow did I bow my head</p>
                <p>There is no peace on earth I said</p>
                <p>The world is strong</p>
                <p>And mocks the song</p>
                <p>Of ‘peace on earth, Goodwill to men’!Then pealed the bells more loud and
                    deep:</p>
                <p>‘God is not dead! nor doth He sleep!</p>
                <p>What’s wrong shall fail</p>
                <p>What’s right prevail</p>
                <p>With peace on earth, goodwill to men.’There’s still a lot to do here for many to
                    whom God gives His blessing and whose lives He spares.While I was writing to you
                    I was summoned to Mr Jones, who asked if I felt like walking to London for him
                    to collect some money. And when I returned in the evening, happily there was a
                    letter from Pa with news of you! <stress reason="family">How I’d like to be with
                        you, with Pa and with you, old boy. And thank God you’re a little better,
                        even though you’re still weak. And you’ll be longing to see Ma too, and now
                        that I hear you’re going home with Ma it makes me think of a passage in
                        Conscience:</stress>
                </p>
                <p>I have been ill. My spirit was weary, my soul disenchanted, my body sickly. I,
                    whom God has at least endowed with moral energy and a vast instinct for
                    affection, was falling into the depths of the bitterest discouragement, and I
                    felt with terror a deadly poison creeping into my shrivelled heart. I have spent
                    three months on the heath: you know, that lovely region where the soul returns
                    to itself and enjoys sweet repose; where everything exudes peace and
                    tranquillity; where the soul, in the presence of God’s immaculate creation,
                    shakes off the yoke of convention, forgets society and frees itself from its
                    bonds with the vigour of returning youth; where every thought takes on the form
                    of prayer; where the heart is emptied of everything that is not in harmony with
                    the freshness and freedom of nature. Oh, there the weary soul finds calm; there,
                    the exhausted man regains a youthful strength. Thus were my days of sickness
                    spent, days of ineffable joy for my soul: smiling at the sun when, in all its
                    majesty, it casts its first rays over the horizon; watching the countryside
                    awaken and catching the first notes of the glorious hymn it addresses to heaven;
                    roaming heaths and forests; questioning my soul — and thinking — scrutinizing
                    and admiring the life of plants and animals, taking deep breaths of the pure
                    air, stopping, going on, turning back, and talking out loud in the solitude;
                    dreaming of splendid things: of God, of the future, of our dear Flanders, of
                    peace and love. And in the evening! To sit under the wide chimneypiece, feet in
                    the ashes, eyes fixed upon a star that sends me its light from on high through
                    the chimneytop, as if calling out to me; or, sunk in a vague reverie, to look at
                    the fire, watching the flames come to life, grow, gasp and crackle, pushing each
                    other aside as if vying to lick the cookingpot with their tongues of fire — and
                    to imagine that this is human life: to be born, to work, to love, to grow up,
                    and to die.... Up above, smoke crowns the chimney with its weightless plume; of
                    all that noise, that crackling, that heat, nothing more comes forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="career">Mr Jones has promised me that I won’t have to teach so
                        much any more, but that I may work in his parish from now on, visiting
                        people, talking to them, and so on.</unstress> May God give this His
                    blessing. Father, I pray that Thou dost not take me out of the world, but that
                    Thou shouldest keep me from the evil. Now I’ll tell you about my walk to London.
                    I left here at noon and arrived where I had to be between 5 and 6 o’clock and
                    posted the letter to Pa and Ma along the way. When I came to the neighbourhood
                    in the city where most of the galleries are, in the neighbourhood of the Strand,
                    I met a lot of acquaintances; it was right at lunchtime and so there were a lot
                    of people on the street, coming from or going to their offices. First of all, I
                    met a young clergyman who used to preach here and with whom I became acquainted
                    at that time, then Mr Wallis’s clerk and then one of the Messrs Wallis himself,
                    in those days I went to their house once or twice – he already has two children
                    – and then I ran into Mr Reid and Mr Richardson, who are old friends by now.
                    Last year at this time Mr Richardson was in Paris, and we walked together to
                    Père Lachaise. Afterwards I went to see Van Wisselingh, where I saw sketches for
                    two church windows.</p>
                <p>In the middle of one of the windows the portrait of an elderly lady, such a noble
                    face, with the words ‘Thy will be done’ inscribed above; in the other window the
                    portrait of her daughter, with the words ‘Faith is the substance of things hoped
                    for, the evidence of things not seen’. <unstress reason="environment">There, as
                        well as in the gallery of Messrs G.&amp;Cie, I saw beautiful paintings and
                        drawings, it’s such a deep pleasure to be reminded time and again of Holland
                        through art.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>In the City I also went to see Mr Gladwell and to St Paul’s. And from the City to
                    the other end of London, there I visited a boy who had left Mr Stokes’s school
                    because of illness, and I found him completely recovered, outside in the street.
                    Then on to the place where I had to collect the money for Mr Jones. <unstress
                        reason="environment">The suburbs of London have a peculiar beauty; between
                        the small houses and gardens there are open places covered with grass and
                        usually with a church or school or poorhouse between the trees and shrubbery
                        in the middle, and it can be so beautiful there when the sun goes down red
                        in the light evening mist.</unstress> It was like that yesterday evening,
                    and later I did so wish that you had seen the streets of London when it began to
                    grow dark and the streetlamps were lit and everyone was going home, it was
                    obvious from everything that it was Saturday evening, and in all that hustle and
                    bustle there was peace, one felt, as it were, the need for and joy at the
                    approach of Sunday. Oh those Sundays and how much is done and striven for on
                    those Sundays, it’s such a relief to those poor neighbourhoods and busy streets.
                        <unstress reason="environment">It was dark in the City, but it was a lovely
                        walk past all those churches along the way.</unstress> Close to the Strand I
                    found an omnibus that brought me a long way, it was already rather late. I rode
                    past Mr Jones’s little church and saw another in the distance where light was
                    still burning so late. I headed for it and found it to be a very beautiful
                    little Roman Catholic church in which a couple of women were praying. Then I
                    came to that dark park I already wrote to you about, and from there I saw in the
                    distance the lights of Isleworth and the church with the ivy and the cemetery
                    with the weeping willows on the banks of the Thames. Now then, Theo, get well
                    soon and read this letter sometime when Ma is sitting with you, because I’d very
                    much like to be with you both in thought. <good_health>I’m really very glad that
                        Mr Jones has promised to let me work in his parish, and that I’ll eventually
                        find the right thing.</good_health> We must seek that, but God must help and
                    that He does, there is no life that He cannot sanctify and inspire. May I also
                    discover ‘that this is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that
                    Christ came into the world to save sinners’, being useful and of some value.</p>
                <p>I long so much to see you sometimes. A hearty handshake to you, and give Ma your
                    hand for me when she’s sitting with you. Adieu.</p>

            <ps>
                <p>Adieu. May God grant that I find grace in the eyes of my Father and Mother and in
                    the eyes of those who will come after me. And now, my boy, another word to you.
                    He who puts himself in a Christian sphere, and seeks and does Christian work as
                    best he can, he will soon feel that he is on a path that he must traverse
                    whether he wants to or not, and will cry out in anguish, God help me, I can do
                    nothing else, and God hears this cry and God is a more powerful help in life
                    than all human and worldly help.</p>
                <p>Psalm 107O Give thanks unto the Lord, for His mercy endureth forever. Let the
                    redeemed of the Lord say so, whom He hath redeemed. They wandered in the
                    wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell in. Hungry and
                    thirsty, their soul fainted in them.</p>
                <p>Then they cried unto the Lord in their trouble, and He delivered them out of
                    their distresses. And He led them forth by the right way, that they might go to
                    a city of habitation.</p>
                <p>He brought them out of darkness, and brake their bands in sunder. For He hath
                    broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron in sunder. He sent His word,
                    and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions.</p>
                <p>They that go down to the sea in ships, these see the great works of the Lord, and
                    His wonders in the deep.</p>
                <p>For He commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves
                    thereof. They mount up to the Heaven, they go down again to the depths: their
                    soul is melted because of trouble. They reel to and fro, and stagger like a
                    drunken man, and are at their wit’s end. Then they cry unto the Lord in their
                    trouble, and He bringeth them out of their distresses. He maketh the storm a
                    calm, so that the waves thereof are still. Then are they glad because they be
                    quiet; so He bringeth them unto their desired haven.</p>
                <p>He setteth the poor on high. The righteous shall see it, and rejoice.Man
                    proposes, but God disposes.Protect me O God, for my bark is so small and Thy sea
                    is so great.Only they that brave its dangers know the secret of the sea,
                    understand its mystery.I hope to receive tomorrow, for the second time, some
                    money for my new work, and to buy a pair of new boots and a new hat with it. And
                    then, God willing, we shall ‘rise up once again’.Many regards to everyone at the
                    Rooses’ and to everyone I know, especially everyone at Mr Tersteeg’s and at the
                    Van Stockums’ and the Haanebeeks’. Tell Ma that it was such a delight, after
                    that journey to London, to put on a pair of socks that she’d knitted.In the
                    streets of London they’re selling sweet violets everywhere; they flower here
                    twice a year. I bought some for Mrs Jones to make up for the pipe I smoke here
                    now and then, mostly late in the evening in the playground. The tobacco here is
                    rather strong, though.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>It’s again high time that you heard something from me. <unstress reason="family"
                        >Thank God you’re recovering,</unstress> I long so much for Christmas –
                    perhaps that time will come before we know it, even though it seems a long way
                    off.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="career">Theo, your brother spoke for the first time in God’s
                        house last Sunday, in the place where it is written ‘I will give peace in
                        this place’. I’m copying out what it was herewith. May it be the first of
                        many.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="environment">It was a clear autumn day and a lovely walk from
                        here to Richmond along the Thames, which reflected the large chestnut trees
                        with their load of yellow leaves and the clear blue sky, and between the
                        treetops the part of Richmond that lies on the hill, the houses with their
                        red roofs and windows without curtains and green gardens, and the grey tower
                        above it all, and below, the large grey bridge with tall poplars on either
                        side, with people crossing it who looked like small black
                        figures.</unstress>
                    <good_health>When I stood in the pulpit I felt like someone emerging from a
                        dark, underground vault into the friendly daylight, and it’s a wonderful
                        thought that from now on, wherever I go, I’ll be preaching the gospel – to
                        do that well one must have the gospel in his heart, may He bring this
                        about.</good_health> God says, Let there be light: and there is light. He
                    speaks, and it is done. He commands, and it stands, and it stands fast. Faithful
                    is He that calleth us, who also will do it. You know enough of the world, Theo,
                    to see how a poor preacher stands rather alone as far as the world is concerned
                    – but He can awaken in us, more and more, awareness and firmness of faith. ‘And
                    yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me’.I know in Whom my faith is
                    founded,</p>
                <p>Though day and night change constantly,</p>
                <p>I know the rock on which I’m grounded,</p>
                <p>My Saviour waits, unfailingly.</p>
                <p>When once life’s evening overcomes me,</p>
                <p>Worn down by ills and strife always,</p>
                <p>For every day Thou hast allowed me,</p>
                <p>I’ll bring Thee higher, purer praise.Praise, Christian, there on your left
                    hand,</p>
                <p>And on your right, is God –</p>
                <p>When I have no more strength to stand,</p>
                <p>When anguished, there is God –</p>
                <p>When loving hand of faithful friend</p>
                <p>Helps not, there is God –</p>
                <p>In death and agony at life’s end,</p>
                <p>Yes, everywhere is God.How I long for Christmas and to see all of you, old boy,
                    it seems to me that I’ve grown years older in these few months.The panting hart,
                    the hunt escapèd,</p>
                <p>Cries no harder for the pleasure</p>
                <p>Of fresh flowing streams of water</p>
                <p>Than my soul doth long for God.</p>
                <p>Yea, my soul thirsts for the Lord,</p>
                <p>God of life, oh when shall I</p>
                <p>Approach Thy sight, and drawing nigh,</p>
                <p>Give Thee praise in Thine own house.Why art thou cast down, my soul,</p>
                <p>Disquieted in me, oh why?</p>
                <p>Foster again the faith of old,</p>
                <p>Rejoice in praising Him most high.</p>
                <p>Oft hath he taken your distress</p>
                <p>And turned it into happiness.</p>
                <p>Hope in Him, eyes heavenward raised,</p>
                <p>For to my God I still give praise.My boy, if illness and difficulties come to
                    meet us, let us thank Him for bringing us into these hours – and let us not
                    forget meekness, for it is written: On this man will I look, even on him who is
                    poor and sorrowful and who trembleth at My word. Yesterday evening I went to
                    Richmond again, and took a walk there on a large common surrounded by trees, and
                    houses around it, above which the tower rose. Dew lay on the grass and it was
                    growing dark; on one side the sky was still full of the glow of the sun that had
                    just set there, on the other side the moon was rising. An old lady (dressed in
                    black) with lovely grey hair was walking beneath the trees. In the middle of the
                    common, some boys had lit a big fire, which one saw flickering in the distance;
                    I thought of this: when once life’s evening overcomes me, worn down by ills and
                    strife always, for every day Thou hast allowed me, I’ll bring Thee higher, purer
                    praise. Adieu, a handshake in thought from</p>

                <p>Regards to Mr and Mrs Tersteeg, Haanebeeks, Van Stockums and everyone at the

                    brother was indeed moved when he stood at the foot of the pulpit and bowed his
                    head and prayed ‘Abba, Father, let Thy name be our beginning’.On Thursday week I
                    hope to speak at Mr Jones’s church: And the Lord added daily to the church such
                    as should be saved, on John and Theagenes. </p>
                <p>Psalm 119:19 I am a stranger in the earth, hide not Thy commandments from me.It
                    is an old faith and it is a good faith that our life is a pilgrims progress –
                    that we are strangers in the earth, but that though this be so, yet we are not
                    alone for our Father is with us. We are pilgrims, our life is a long walk, a
                    journey from earth to heaven.</p>
                <p>The beginning of this life is this. There is one who remembereth no more Her
                    sorrow and Her anguish for joy that a man is born into the world. She is our
                    Mother. The end of our pilgrimage is the entering in Our Fathers house where are
                    many mansions, where He has gone before us to prepare a place for us. The end of
                    this life is what we call death – it is an hour in which words are spoken,
                    things are seen and felt that are kept in the secret chambers of the hearts of
                    those who stand by, it is so that all of us have such things in our hearts or
                    forebodings of such things. There is sorrow in the hour when a man is born into
                    the world, but also joy – deep and unspeakable – thankfulness so great that it
                    reacheth the highest Heavens. Yes the Angels of God, they smile, they hope and
                    they rejoice when a man is born in the world. There is sorrow in the hour of
                    death – but there too is joy unspeakable when it is the hour of death of one who
                    has fought a good fight. There is One who has said, I am the resurrection and
                    the life, if any man believeth in Me, though he were dead, yet shall he live.
                    There was an Apostle who heard a voice from heaven, saying: Blessed are they
                    that die in the Lord for they rest from their labour and their works follow
                    them. There is joy when a man is born in the world but there is greater joy when
                    a Spirit has passed through great tribulation, when an Angel is born in Heaven.
                    Sorrow is better than joy – and even in mirth the heart is sad – and it is
                    better to go to the house of mourning than to the house of feasts, for by the
                    sadness of the countenance the heart is made better. Our nature is sorrowful but
                    for those who have learnt and are learning to look at Jesus Christ there is
                    always reason to rejoice. It is a good word, that of St Paul: As being sorrowful
                    yet always rejoicing. For those who believe in Jesus Christ there is no death
                    and no sorrow that is not mixed with hope – no despair – there is only a
                    constantly being born again, a constantly going from darkness into light. They
                    do not mourn as those who have no hope – Christian Faith makes life to evergreen
                    life.We are pilgrims in the earth and strangers – we come from afar and we are
                    going far. The journey of our life goes from the loving breast of our Mother on
                    earth to the arms of our Father in heaven. Everything on earth changes – we have
                    no abiding city here – it is the experience of everybody: That it is Gods will
                    that we should part with what we dearest have on earth – we ourselves, we change
                    in many respects, we are not what we once were, we shall not remain what we are
                    now. From infancy we grow up to boys and girls – young men and young women – and
                    if God spares us and helps us – to husbands and wives, Fathers and Mothers in
                    our turn, and then, slowly but surely the face that once had the ‘early dew of
                    morning’ gets its wrinkles, the eyes that once beamed with youth and gladness
                    speak of a sincere deep and earnest sadness – though they may keep the fire of
                    Faith, Hope and Charity – though they may beam with Gods spirit. The hair turns
                    grey or we loose it – ah – indeed we only pass through the earth, we only pass
                    through life – we are strangers and pilgrims in the earth. The world passes and
                    all its glory. Let our later days be nearer to Thee and therefore better than
                    these. Yet we may not live on just anyhow – no, we have a strife to strive and a
                    fight to fight. What is it we must do: We must love God with all our strength,
                    with all our might, with all our heart, with all our soul, we must love our
                    neighbour as ourselves. These two commandments we must keep and if we follow
                    after these, if we are devoted to this, we are not alone for our Father in
                    Heaven is with us, helps us and guides us, gives us strength day by day, hour by
                    hour. and so we can do all things through Christ who gives us might. We are
                    strangers in the earth, hide not Thy commandments from us. Open Thou our eyes,
                    that we may behold wondrous things out of Thy law. Teach us to do Thy will and
                    influence our hearts that the love of Christ may constrain us and that we may be
                    brought to do what we must do to be saved.On the road from earth to Heaven</p>
                <p>Do Thou guide us with Thine eye.We are weak but Thou art mighty</p>
                <p>Hold us with Thy powerful hand.Our life, we might compare it to a journey, we go
                    from the place where we were born to a far off haven. Our earlier life might be
                    compared to sailing on a river, but very soon the waves become higher, the wind
                    more violent, we are at sea almost before we are aware of it – and the prayer
                    from the heart ariseth to God: Protect me o God, for my bark is so small and Thy
                    sea is so great. The heart of man is very much like the sea, it has its storms,
                    it has its tides and in its depths it has its pearls too. The heart that seeks
                    for God and for a Godly life has more storms than any other. Let us see how the
                    Psalmist describes a storm at sea, He must have felt the storm in his heart to
                    describe it so. We read in the 107th Psalm, They that go down to the sea in
                    ships, that do business in great waters, these see the works of the Lord and His
                    wonders in the deep. For He commandeth and raiseth up a stormy wind which
                    lifteth up the waves thereof. They mount up to Heaven, they go down again to the
                    depth, their soul melteth in them because of their trouble. Then they cry unto
                    the Lord in their trouble and He bringeth them out of their distresses, He
                    bringeth them unto their desired haven.</p>
                <p>Do we not feel this sometimes on the sea of our lives. Does not everyone of you
                    feel with me the storms of life or their forebodings or their recollections?</p>
                <p>And now let us read a description of another storm at sea in the New Testament,
                    as we find it in the VIth Chapter of the Gospel according to St John in the 17th
                    to the 21st verse. And the disciples entered into a ship and went over the sea
                    toward Capernaum. And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew. So when
                    they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking
                    on the sea and drawing nigh unto the ship and they were afraid. Then they
                    willingly received Him into the ship and immediately the ship was at the land
                    whither they went. You who have experienced the great storms of life, you over
                    whom all the waves and all the billows of the Lord have gone – have you not
                    heard, when your heart failed for fear, the beloved well known voice – with
                    something in its tone that reminded you of the voices that charmed your
                    childhood – the voice of Him whose name is Saviour and Prince of peace, saying
                    as it were to you personally – mind to you personally ‘It is I, be not afraid’.
                    Fear not. Let not your heart be troubled. And we whose lives have been calm up
                    to now, calm in comparison of what others have felt – let us not fear the storms
                    of life, amidst the high waves of the sea and under the grey clouds of the sky
                    we shall see Him approaching for Whom we have so often longed and watched, Him
                    we need so – and we shall hear His voice, It is I, be not afraid. And if after
                    an hour or season of anguish or distress or great difficulty or pain or sorrow
                    we hear Him ask us ‘Dost Thou love me’ then let us say, Lord Thou knowest all
                    things, Thou knowest that I love Thee. And let us keep that heart full of the
                    love of Christ and may from thence issue a life which the love of Christ
                    constraineth. Lord Thou knowest all things, Thou knowest that I love Thee, when
                    we look back on our past we feel sometimes as if we did love Thee, for
                    whatsoever we have loved, we loved in Thy name. Have we not often felt as a
                    widow and an orphan – in joy and prosperity as well, and more even than under
                    grief – because of the thought of Thee.</p>
                <p>Truly our soul waiteth for Thee more than they that watch for the morning – our
                    eyes are up unto Thee, o Thou who dwellest in Heavens. In our days too there can
                    be such a thing as seeking the Lord.What is it we ask of God – is it a great
                    thing? Yes it is a great thing, peace for the ground of our heart, rest for our
                    soul – give us that one thing and then we want not much more, then we can do
                    without many things, then can we suffer great things for Thy names sake. We want
                    to know that we are Thine and that Thou art ours, we want to be thine – to be
                    Christians. We want a Father, a Fathers love and a Fathers approval. May the
                    experience of life make our eye single and fix it on Thee. May we grow better as
                    we go on in life.We have spoken of the storms on the journey of life, but now
                    let us speak of the calms and joys of Christian life. And yet, my dear friends,
                    let us rather cling to the seasons of difficulty and work and sorrow, even for
                    the calms are treacherous often.</p>
                <p>The heart has its storms, has its seasons of drooping but also its calms and even
                    its times of exaltation. There is a time of sighing and of praying but there is
                    also a time of answer to prayer. Weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh
                    in the morning.The heart that is fainting</p>
                <p>May grow full to o’erflowing</p>
                <p>And they that behold it</p>
                <p>Shall wonder and know not</p>
                <p>That God at its fountains</p>
                <p>Far off has been raining.My peace I leave with you – we saw how there is peace
                    even in the storm. Thanks be to God who has given us to be born and to live in a
                    Christian country. Has any of us forgotten the golden hours of our early days at
                    home, and since we left that home – for many of us have had to leave that home
                    and to earn their living and to make their way in the world. Has He not brought
                    us thus far, have we lacked anything. We believe Lord, help Thou our unbelief. I
                    still feel the rapture, the thrill of joy I felt when for the first time I cast
                    a deep look in the lives of my Parents, when I felt by instinct how much they
                    were Christians. And I still feel that feeling of eternal youth and enthusiasm
                    wherewith I went to God, saying ‘I will be a Christian too’. Are we what we
                    dreamt we should be? No – but still – the sorrows of life, the multitude of
                    things of daily life and of daily duties, so much more numerous than we expected
                    – the tossing to and fro in the world, they have covered it over – but it is not
                    dead, it sleepeth. The old eternal faith and love of Christ, it may sleep in us
                    but it is not dead and God can revive it in us. But though to be born again to
                    eternal life, to the life of Faith, Hope and Charity – and to an evergreen life
                    – to the life of a Christian and of a Christian workman be a gift of God, a work
                    of God – and of God alone – yet let us put the hand to the plough on the field
                    of our heart, let us cast out our net once more – let us try once more – God
                    knows the intention of the spirit, God knows us better than we know ourselves
                    for He made us and not we ourselves. He knows of what things we have need, He
                    knows what is good for us. May He give His blessing on the seed of His word that
                    has been sown in our hearts.</p>
                <p>God helping us, we shall get through life. With every temptation He will give a
                    way to escape.</p>
                <p>Father we pray Thee not that Thou shouldest take us out of the world, but we pray
                    Thee to keep us from evil. Give us neither poverty nor riches, feed us with
                    bread convenient for us. And let Thy songs be our delight in the houses of our
                    pilgrimage. God of our Fathers be our God: may their people be our people, their
                    Faith our faith. We are strangers in the earth, hide not Thy commandments from
                    us but may the love of Christ constrain us. Entreat us not to leave Thee or to
                    refrain from following after Thee. Thy people shall be our people, Thou shalt be
                    our God.Our life is a pilgrims progress. I once saw a very beautiful picture, it
                    was a landscape at evening. In the distance on the right hand side a row of
                    hills appearing blue in the evening mist. Above those hills the splendour of the
                    sunset, the grey clouds with their linings of silver and gold and purple. The
                    landscape is a plain or heath covered with grass and heather, here and there the
                    white stem of a birch tree and its yellow leaves, for it was in Autumn. Through
                    the landscape a road leads to a high mountain far far away, on the top of that
                    mountain a city whereon the setting sun casts a glory. On the road walks a
                    pilgrim, staff in hand. He has been walking for a good long while already and he
                    is very tired. And now he meets a woman, a figure in black that makes one think
                    of St Pauls word ‘As being sorrowful yet always rejoicing’. That Angel of God
                    has been placed there to encourage the pilgrims and to answer their
                    questions:And the pilgrim asks her: Does the road go uphill then all the
                    way?</p>
                <p>and the answer is: ‘Yes to the very end’ –</p>
                <p>and he asks again: And will the journey take all day long?</p>
                <p>and the answer is: ‘From morn till night my friend’. And the pilgrim goes on
                    sorrowful yet always rejoicing – sorrowful because it is so far off and the road
                    so long. Hopeful as he looks up to the eternal city far away, resplendent in the
                    evening glow, and he thinks of two old sayings he has heard long ago – the one
                    is:‘There must much strife be striven</p>
                <p>There must much suffering be suffered</p>
                <p>There must much prayer be prayed</p>
                <p>And then the end will be peace.’and the other:The water comes up to the lips</p>
                <p>But higher comes it not.And he says, I shall be more and more tired but also
                    nearer and nearer to Thee. Has not man a strife on earth? But there is a
                    consolation from God in this life. An angel of God, comforting men – that is the
                    Angel of Charity. Let us not forget Her. And when everyone of us goes back to
                    daily things and daily duties, let us not forget – that things are not what they
                    seem, that God by the things of daily life teacheth us higher things, that our
                    life is a pilgrims progress and that we are strangers in the earth – but that we
                    have a God and Father who preserveth strangers, and that we are all
                    bretheren.</p>
                <p>Amen.And now the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, our Father,
                    and the fellowship of the Holy Ghost, be with us for evermore.</p>
                <p>Amen.(Reading Scripture Psalm XCI)Tossed with rough winds and faint with
                    fear,</p>
                <p>Above the tempest soft and clear</p>
                <p>What still small accents greet mine ear</p>
                <p>‘’t Is I, be not afraid.’’t Is I, who washed thy spirit white;</p>
                <p>’t Is I, who gave thy blind eyes sight,</p>
                <p>’t Is I, thy Lord, thy life, thy light,</p>
                <p>’t Is I, be not afraid.These raging winds, this surging sea</p>
                <p>Have spent their deadly force on me</p>
                <p>They bear no breath of wrath to Thee</p>
                <p>’t Is I, be not afraid.This bitter cup, I drank it first</p>
                <p>To thee it is no draught accurst</p>
                <p>The hand that gives it thee is pierced</p>
                <p>‘’t Is I, be not afraid’.When on the other side thy feet,</p>
                <p>Shall rest, mid thousand welcomes sweet;</p>
                <p>One well known voice thy heart shall greet –</p>
                <p>’t Is I, be not afraid.Mine eyes are watching by thy bed</p>
                <p>Mine arms are underneath thy head</p>
                <p>My blessing is around Thee shed</p>
                <p>‘’t Is I, be not afraid’.Again, a handshake in thought – yesterday evening I was
                    at Turnham Green in place of Mr Jones, who wasn’t well. I walked over there with
                    the oldest boy, 17 years old, but he’s as big as I am and has a beard. He’ll go
                    into business later, his father has a large factory; he has a good, honest,
                    feeling heart and a great need of religion, it is his hope and desire to do good
                    among the workers later on in life, I recommended ‘Felix Holt’ by Eliot to him.
                        <good_health>It was lovely in the park with the old elm trees in the
                        moonlight and the dew on the grass. It was so good for me to speak in the
                        little church, it is a little wooden church.</good_health> Goodbye, Theo.

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>I feel the need to enclose a few words to you. You’ll be having pleasant days at
                    home, I almost envy you, old boy.</p>
                <p>What lovely autumn weather we’re having. You probably see the sun rising in the
                    morning too. Which room are you sleeping in?</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="environment">If you can get ‘The imitation of Christ’ one of
                        these days, read some of it, it’s a wonderful book, one that’s very
                        enlightening. It describes so beautifully, for the one who wrote the book
                        did it himself, how good it is to wage the holy war of devotion to one’s
                        duty, and the heartfelt joy that is to be found in doing good deeds and in
                        doing what one does well.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>You must read the letter for Pa and Ma sometime, <unstress reason="environment"
                        >I’ve taken such lovely walks recently, which were especially good after the
                        anxiety of the first months here.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>It is indeed true that every day has its own evil and its own good, too. But how
                    terrible life must be, especially later on – when the evil of each day increases
                    as far as the things of the world are concerned – if it isn’t supported and
                    comforted by faith. And in Christ all things of the world can improve and become
                    sanctified, as it were. These are beautiful words, and happy are those who come
                    across them, ‘Nothing pleaseth me but in Christ, and in Him all things please
                    me’. But one doesn’t achieve this all of a sudden. But he that seeketh
                    findeth.</p>
                <p>Do write a few words again the next time Pa and Ma write. I hope to go to
                    Richmond again on Monday evening and to take the words: But when he was yet a
                    great way off, his Father saw him, and had compassion.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="career">Theo, woe is me if I don’t preach the gospel, and if I
                        didn’t have my sight fixed on that and didn’t have hope and faith in Christ,
                        then I would only have woe.</unstress>

                <p>I should have liked you to be in the little church at Turnham Green last Thursday
                    evening; I walked over there with the oldest boy in the school and told him
                    several of Andersen’s fairy tales, including ‘The story of a mother’.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="environment">And now we’re slowly heading towards winter, and
                        many dread it, but Christmas is wonderful, it’s like the moss on the roofs
                        and like the pine and the holly and the ivy in the snow.</unstress> How I’d
                    like to come with Anna, may she find something soon, I’ll write to her again
                    today.</p>
                <p>Today one of the maids left, they don’t have it easy here and she couldn’t stand
                    it any longer – indeed, everyone, richer or poorer, stronger or weaker, has
                    moments when he can go no further, when ‘all these things seem to be against
                    us’, when much of what we have built collapses.</p>
                <p>
                    <good_health>And yet, one mustn’t lose heart, Elijah had to pray all of seven
                        times, and David had ashes on his head many a time.</good_health>
                </p>
                <p>There’s a new assistant teacher at the school, because I’ll have to work more at
                    Turnham Green from now on. He has never been away from home before, and won’t
                    find it easy in the beginning.</p>
                <p>And now a handshake in thought, it’s already late and I’m rather tired. I wish
                    you well. Do think now and then of</p>

            <body>
                <p>Thanks for your last letter, which I received at the same time as one from Etten.
                    So you’re back at the gallery. Do whatever your hand finds to do, with all your
                    might, and your work and prayers cannot fail to be blessed. <stress
                        reason="family">How I’d have liked to go along on that walk to Het Heike and
                        to Sprundel in the first snow.</stress> But before I go further, I’ll copy
                    out a couple of poems that you’ll no doubt like.The journey of lifeTwo lovers by
                    a mossgrown spring</p>
                <p>They leaned soft cheeks together</p>
                <p>Mingled the dark and sunny hair,</p>
                <p>And heard the wooing thrushes sing</p>
                <p>o Budding time</p>
                <p>o Loves best prime.Two wedded from the portal steps</p>
                <p>The bells made happy carolings</p>
                <p>The air was soft as fanning wings</p>
                <p>While petals on the pathway slept</p>
                <p>O pure eyed bride</p>
                <p>o tender pride.Two faces o’er a cradle bent</p>
                <p>Two hands above the head were locked</p>
                <p>These pressed each other while they rocked</p>
                <p>Those watched a life which love had sent</p>
                <p>O solemn hour</p>
                <p>o hidden power.Two parents by the evening fire</p>
                <p>The red light fell about their knees</p>
                <p>On heads that rose by slow degrees</p>
                <p>Like buds upon the lily spire</p>
                <p>O patient life</p>
                <p>O tender strife.The two still sat together there</p>
                <p>The red light shone about their knees</p>
                <p>But all the heads by slow degrees</p>
                <p>Had gone and left that lonely pair</p>
                <p>O Voyage fast</p>
                <p>O Banished past.The red light shone upon the floor</p>
                <p>And made the space between them wide</p>
                <p>They drew their chairs up side by side</p>
                <p>Their pale cheeks joined, and said ‘once more’</p>
                <p>O, memories!</p>
                <p>O past that is!The three little chairs.They sat alone by the bright woodfire</p>
                <p>The greyhaired dame and the aged sire</p>
                <p>Dreaming of days gone by;</p>
                <p>The tear drop fell on the wrinkled cheek</p>
                <p>They both had thoughts that they could not speak,</p>
                <p>And each heart uttered a sigh.For their sad and tearful eyes descried</p>
                <p>Three little chairs placed side by side</p>
                <p>Against the sitting room wall;</p>
                <p>Old fashioned enough as there they stood</p>
                <p>Their seats of flag, and their frames of wood,</p>
                <p>With their backs so straight and tall.Then the sire shook His silvery head,</p>
                <p>And with trembling voice he gently said,</p>
                <p>‘Mother, those empty chairs,</p>
                <p>They bring us such sad, sad thoughts tonight,</p>
                <p>We’ll put them for ever out of sight</p>
                <p>In the small dark room upstairs’.But she answered: Father, no, not yet;</p>
                <p>For I look at them, and I forget</p>
                <p>That the children went away,</p>
                <p>The boys come back, and our Mary, too,</p>
                <p>With her apron on of checkered blue</p>
                <p>And sit here every day.Johnny still whittles a ships tall masts,</p>
                <p>And Willie his leaden bullets casts</p>
                <p>While Mary her patchwork sows;</p>
                <p>At evening time three childish prayers</p>
                <p>Go up to God from those little chairs,</p>
                <p>So softly that no one knows.Johnny comes back from the billowy deep,</p>
                <p>Willie wakes from the battle field sleep,</p>
                <p>To say good night to me:</p>
                <p>Mary’s a wife and mother no more,</p>
                <p>But a tired child whose playtime is o’er, And comes to rest on my knee.So let
                    them stand there – though empty now,</p>
                <p>And every time when alone we bow</p>
                <p>At the Fathers throne to pray,</p>
                <p>We’ll ask to meet the children above</p>
                <p>In our Saviours home of rest and love,</p>
                <p>Where no child goeth away.</p>
                <p>In his letter Pa wrote, among other things: ‘in the afternoon I had to go to
                    Hoeven, Ma had ordered the cab but it couldn’t come, because they hadn’t yet
                    been able to have the horses’ shoes frosted – I therefore decided to go on foot
                    and good Uncle Jan didn’t want me to go alone, so he came along. It was a hard
                    journey, but Uncle Jan rightly said: the devil is never so black that you can’t
                    look him in the face. And indeed, we arrived there and returned safe and sound,
                    even though there was a gale blowing, coupled with freezing rain, so that the
                    roads were slippery as ice, and I cannot describe how wonderful it was to sit so
                    cosily in a nice warm room in the evening, resting after work – that dear Theo
                    was still with us then’.</p>
                <p>Shall we, too, go once again to some church in this way? As sorrowful yet alway
                    rejoicing, with everlasting joy in our hearts because we are the poor in the
                    kingdom of God, because we have found in Christ a friend in our lives that
                    sticketh closer than a brother, who brought us to the end of the journey as to
                    the door of the Father’s house. May God grant it – what God hath done is done
                    aright.</p>
                <p>Last Sunday evening I went to a village on the Thames, Petersham. In the morning
                    I had been at the Sunday school at Turnham Green, and went after sunset from
                    there to Richmond and then on to Petersham. It grew dark early and I wasn’t sure
                    of the way, it was a surprisingly muddy road over a kind of embankment or rise
                    on the hill covered with gnarled elm trees and shrubs. At last I saw below the
                    rise a light in a small house, and scrambled and waded over to it, and there I
                    was told the way. <unstress reason="environment">But, old boy, there was a
                        beautiful little wooden church with a kindly light at the end of that dark
                        road, I read Acts V:1416. Acts XII:517, Peter in prison, and Acts XX:737,
                        Paul preaching in Macedonia, and then I told the story of John and Theagenes
                        yet again. There was a harmonium in the church, played by a young woman from
                        a boarding school that was attending en masse.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="environment">In the morning it was so beautiful on the way to
                        Turnham Green, the chestnut trees and clear blue sky and the morning sun
                        were reflected in the water of the Thames, the grass was gloriously green
                        and everywhere all around the sound of church bells.</unstress> The day
                    before I’d gone on a long journey to London, I left here at 4 in the morning,
                    arrived at Hyde Park at half past six, the mist was lying on the grass and
                    leaves were falling from the trees, in the distance one saw the shimmering
                    lights of streetlamps that hadn’t yet been put out, and the towers of
                    Westminster Abbey and the Houses of Parliament, and the sun rose red in the
                    morning mist – from there on to Whitechapel, that poor district of London, then
                    to Chancery Lane and Westminster, then to Clapham to visit Mrs Loyer again, her
                    birthday was the day before. She is indeed a widow in whose heart the psalms of
                    David and the chapters of Isaiah are not dead but sleeping. Her name is written
                    in the book of life. I also went to Mr Obach’s to see his wife and children
                    again. Then from there to Lewisham, where I arrived at the Gladwells at half
                    past three. It was exactly 3 months ago that I was there that Saturday their
                    daughter was buried, I stayed with them around 3 hours and thoughts of many
                    kinds occurred to all of us, too many to express. There I also wrote to Harry in
                    Paris. I hope you’ll see him sometime. It may well be that you too will go to
                    Paris sometime. That night I was back here at half past ten, I went part of the
                    way with the underground railway. Fortunately I’d received some money for Mr
                    Jones. Am working on Ps. 42:1, My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God. At
                    Petersham I told the congregation that they would be hearing poor English, but
                    that when I spoke I thought of the man in the parable who said ‘have patience
                    with me, and I will pay thee all’, God help me.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="environment">At Mr Obach’s I saw the painting, or rather the
                        sketch, by Boughton: the pilgrim’s progress. If you can ever get Bunyan’s
                        Pilgrim’s progress, it’s very worthwhile reading. For my part I love it with
                        heart and soul.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>It’s nighttime now, I’m still doing a bit of work for the Gladwells at Lewisham,
                    copying out one thing and another etc.; one must strike while the iron is hot
                    and soften the human heart when it is burning within us. Tomorrow off to London
                    again for Mr Jones. Beneath that poem The journey of life and The three little
                    chairs one should write: that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he
                    might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and
                    which are on earth. So be it. A handshake in thought, give my regards to Mr and
                    Mrs Tersteeg and to everyone at the Rooses’ and the Haanebeeks’ and the Van
                    Stockums’ and the Mauves’, adieu and believe me</p>

                <p>I sincerely wish you the best in the new year, I wish you well and may you be
                    blessed in all things. Wonderful to have seen each other again, how beautiful it
                    was that morning you left, and how often we’ll think back on that trip to
                    Chaam.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="family">Ma’s eye is hurting a lot again, she has a bandage
                        on;</stress> Pa delivered such a beautiful sermon again this morning.</p>

                    <stress reason="family">And now this evening New Year’s Eve again, if only you
                        were here.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>Now then, there’s something I must tell you: a couple of days ago Mr Braat of
                    Dordrecht paid a visit to Uncle Vincent and they spoke about me, and Uncle asked
                    Mr B. whether he would have a place for me, if I should wish it. Mr B. thought
                    he might have a place, and said that I should come sometime to talk about it. So
                    I went there early yesterday morning; Pa and Ma and I, too, thought it was
                    something we shouldn’t let pass without seeing what it was.</p>
                <p>Agreed that after the New Year I should go to him for a week, after that we’ll
                    see.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="career">There are many things that make it desirable, first
                        and foremost my being back in Holland near Pa and Ma, and also you and the
                        others. Moreover, the salary would certainly be a little better than with Mr
                        Jones, and especially with an eye to later, when a man has need of more, one
                        is obliged to think of such things.</unstress>

                    <good_health>As far as the other thing is concerned, for these reasons I won’t
                        give it up. Pa’s spirit is so great and manysided, and at all events I hope
                        that something of it will develop in me.</good_health> The change means that
                    now, instead of teaching those boys, I’ll be working in a bookshop.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="family">How often we’ve longed to be together, and how terrible
                        it is to feel so far away from one another in cases of illness or anxiety,
                        as we felt, for example, during your illness, and then the feeling that lack
                        of money may very well stand in the way of our being together in times of
                        need.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>It’s quite possible, then, that I’ll go there.</p>
                <p>Yesterday evening I was at Uncle Vincent’s to tell him that I’d just been to
                    Dordrecht, <unstress reason="environment">it was a stormy evening, you can
                        imagine how beautiful the road to Princenhage was with the dark clouds with
                        their silver linings. I also went briefly to the Roman Catholic church,
                        where evening Mass was under way, it was a beautiful sight, all those
                        peasants and their wives with their black clothes and white caps, and the
                        church looked so friendly in the evening light.</unstress> You must also
                    tell Mr Tersteeg straightaway that I’ll be going there for a week to see how it
                    goes, let His Hon. read this letter, if you will, and be sure to give him and
                    his wife my best wishes for a happy New Year. I’m writing in great haste, Anna
                    and the girls and Cor went to Princenhage, and Pa wanted me to go with them.
                    Aunt came back with them in the carriage and I went for a walk with Willem
                    Carbentus. Now, old boy, dear brother, what good days those were when we were
                    all together, have a good New Year’s Eve and believe me</p>

                <p>You’ll have expected a letter sooner; <good_health>things are going rather well
                        in the shop, and it’s so busy that I go there at 8 o’clock in the morning
                        and come back at 1 o’clock at night, but I’m happy about that.</good_health>
                </p>
                <p>I hope to go to Etten on 11 February. As you know, that’s when they’ll celebrate
                    Pa’s birthday, would you be able to come as well? I hope to give Pa Eliot’s
                    ‘Novellen’ (a translation of Scenes from clerical life), if we were to give
                    something together we could give him Adam Bede as well.</p>
                <p>Wrote last Sunday to Mr Jones and his wife that I’m not coming back, and without
                    my being able to help it, the letter grew quite long – out of the abundance of
                    the heart – did wish that they, for their part, would remember me, and asked
                    them ‘to wrap my recollection in the cloak of Charity’.</p>
                <p>The two prints of Christus Consolator that I got from you are hanging in my
                    little room – <unstress reason="environment">saw the paintings in the museum,
                        and also ‘Christ in Gethsemane’ by Scheffer, which is unforgettable, a long
                        time ago that painting moved Pa just as much – then there’s a sketch of The
                        sorrows of the earth and various drawings, and also the portrait of his
                        studio and, as you know, the portrait of his Mother. There are other
                        beautiful paintings as well, such as the Achenbach and Schelfhout and
                        Koekkoek and, among others, a beautiful Allebé, an old man by the
                        stove.</unstress> Will we look at them together some day?</p>
                <p>The first Sunday I was here I heard a sermon on ‘Behold, I make all things new’,
                    and in the evening ‘Now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face.
                    When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a
                    child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things’.</p>
                <p>This morning I went to hear the Rev. Beversen in a small old church, it was the
                    Lord’s Supper and his text was ‘If any man thirst, let him come unto Me, and
                    drink’.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="environment">The window of my room looks out over gardens with
                        pine trees and poplars etc. and the back of old houses, including a large
                        one covered with ivy, ‘a strange old plant is the ivy green’, said Dickens.
                        There can be something so serious and rather sombre in that view, and you
                        should see it with the morning sun on it.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>When I look at it I sometimes think of a letter of yours in which you speak of
                    such an ivycovered house, do you remember it? If you can afford it – if I can,
                    I’ll do it too – subscribe to this year’s Katholieke Illustratie, which has
                    Doré’s prints of London – the wharves on the Thames, Westminster, Whitechapel,
                    the Underground railway &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="friendship">One of the people in the house I live in is a
                        schoolmaster. Last Sunday, and today as well, we took a lovely walk along
                        the canals and outside town as well, along the river Merwede, we also passed
                        the place where you waited for the boat.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>This evening when the sun went down and was reflected in the water and the
                    windows, throwing a strong golden glow on everything, it was just like a
                    painting by Cuyp. This evening I went to hear the Rev. Keller van Hoorn, who
                    spoke on ‘I come to do Thy will, O Lord’. He just lost his daughter, and in all
                    his words – I also heard him speak on ‘He that hath not loved knoweth not God;
                    for God is love’ – one can sense what he feels.</p>
                <p>Write again soon when you have the time, I’ll have rather a lot of bookkeeping to
                    do for the time being and will no doubt be busy. Give my regards to everyone at
                    the Rooses’, and accept a handshake in thought from</p>

            <body>
                <p>Adam Bede costs 2.60 guilders, so herewith you get back 1.40 guilders. Now I only
                    hope that it will give them some pleasure at home, but no doubt it will.</p>
                <p>Thanks for your letter, which made me so happy. When next we meet we’ll look each
                    other straight in the eye. <unstress reason="family">I sometimes think how
                        wonderful it is that we have the same ground beneath our feet and that we
                        speak the same language.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>Last week we were flooded here. Coming from the shop between 12 and 1 at night, I
                    took another turn around the Grote Kerk. The wind was blowing hard in the elm
                    trees surrounding it, and the moon shone through the rainclouds and reflected in
                    the canals that were already filled to the brim. At 3 o’clock in the morning we
                    were all rushing around at Rijken’s, the grocer in whose house I’m lodging,
                    bringing things upstairs from the shop, because the water was an ell high in the
                    house. There was quite a bit of commotion, and in all the downstairs rooms
                    people were busy bringing upstairs what they could, and a small boat came down
                    the street. In the morning, when it was beginning to grow light, one saw a group
                    of men at the end of the street, wading one after another to their warehouses.
                        <stress reason="money">There’s a lot of damage, the water has also got into
                        the place where Mr Braat keeps his paper &amp;c., not because of the flood
                        but because of the great pressure coming from under the ground.Mr Braat says
                        it will cost him a banknote of the largest kind.</stress> It took us a day
                    and a half to carry everything to an upstairs flat. Working with your hands like
                    that for a day is a welcome change, though it was a pity it was for that reason.
                        <unstress reason="environment">You should have seen the sun go down that
                        evening, the streets shone of gold, the way Cuyp used to paint
                        them.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>Longing to have my trunk, which is on the way, one reason being to have some
                    prints hanging in my room again. I now have Christus Consolator, which you gave
                    me, and two English woodcuts, namely the Supper at Emmaus: ‘But they constrained
                    Him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent’,
                    and another: ‘They that sat in darkness and the shadow of death have seen a
                    great light’; ‘Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning’.
                        <bad_health>There can come a time in life when one is tired of everything,
                        as it were, and has the feeling as if everything that one does is wrong, and
                        there’s certainly some truth in that – is this a feeling that one ought to
                        avoid and repress, or it is rather ‘the godly sorrow’ that one must not fear
                        but carefully consider whether it can perhaps compel us to do good – is it
                        perhaps ‘the godly sorrow that worketh a choice not to be repented
                        of’?</bad_health> And at such times, in which one feels tired of oneself,
                    one may think with heedfulness, hope and love of the words ‘Come unto Me, all ye
                    that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon
                    you, and learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest
                    unto your soul. For My yoke is easy, and my burden is light’. ‘If any man will
                    come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow
                    Me.’ At such times one may well reflect upon: ‘Except a man be born again, he
                    cannot see the kingdom of God’. <good_health>If we let ourselves be taught by
                        the experience of life and led by godly sorrow, then new vitality may spring
                        from the tired heart. If we are once good and tired, then we shall believe
                        more firmly in God, and shall find in Christ, through His word, a Friend and
                        Comforter. And then there may be times when we feel ‘thou removest my
                        iniquities from me as far as the east is from the west’, when we feel
                        something of ‘the zeal for Thine house hath eaten me up’ and ‘our God is a
                        consuming fire’ – when we shall again know what it is to be fervent in
                        spirit. Hope will not always fade away.</good_health>
                </p>
                <p>Let us not forget ‘the things which we have heard from the beginning’.</p>
                <p>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
                    God so loved the world, that He gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever
                    believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life. Nothing shall
                    separate us from the Love of Christ, neither things present, nor things to
                    come.Rejoice on earth, praise God on high,</p>
                <p>Let thankful tears stream from your eye</p>
                <p>For Him from whom all blessings flow.</p>
                <p>This joyful day then celebrate,</p>
                <p>The greatest the world has seen to date,</p>
                <p>On its horizon all aglow.Still welcoming us, that blessed night,</p>
                <p>In which the stars with beauteous light</p>
                <p>And heavenly hosts with one glad voice</p>
                <p>In Jesus’ coming do rejoice.I know in Whom my faith is founded,</p>
                <p>Though day and night change constantly,</p>
                <p>I know the rock on which I’m grounded,</p>
                <p>My Saviour waits, unfailingly.</p>
                <p>When once life’s evening overcomes me,</p>
                <p>Worn down by ills and strife always,</p>
                <p>For every day Thou hast allowed me,</p>
                <p>I’ll bring Thee higher, purer praise.The panting hart, the hunt escapèd,</p>
                <p>Cries no harder for the pleasure</p>
                <p>Of fresh flowing streams of water</p>
                <p>Than my soul doth long for God.</p>
                <p>Yea, my soul thirsts for the Lord,</p>
                <p>God of life, oh when shall I</p>
                <p>Approach Thy sight, and drawing nigh,</p>
                <p>Give Thee praise in Thine own house.Why art thou cast down, my soul,</p>
                <p>Disquieted in me, oh why?</p>
                <p>Foster again the faith of old,</p>
                <p>Rejoice in praising Him most high.</p>
                <p>Oft hath he taken your distress</p>
                <p>And turned it into happiness.</p>
                <p>Hope in Him, eyes heavenward raised,</p>
                <p>For to my God I still give praise.Hope will not always fade forever.Last Sunday
                    morning I was in the French church here, which is very serious and dignified and
                    has something very appealing. The text was Hold that fast which thou hast, that
                    no man take thy crown. The end of the sermon was ‘If I forget thee, O Jerusalem,
                    let my right hand forget her cunning’.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="environment">After church I took a lovely walk alone on a dyke
                        running past the mills, there was a brilliant sky above the meadows that was
                        reflected in the ditches. There are curious things in other countries, such
                        as the French coast which I saw at Dieppe – the chalk cliffs with green
                        grass on top – the sea and sky – the harbour with old boats like Daubigny
                        paints them, with brown nets and sails, the small houses including a couple
                        of restaurants with little white curtains and green pine branches in the
                        window – the carts with white horses with big blue halters decorated with
                        red tassels – the drivers with their blue smocks, the fishermen with their
                        beards and oiled clothing and the French women with pale faces, dark, often
                        somewhat deepset eyes, black dress and white cap, and such as the streets of
                        London in the rain with the streetlamps, and a night spent there on the
                        steps of an old, small grey church, as happened to me this summer after that
                        journey from Ramsgate</unstress> – there are certainly curious things in
                    other countries, too – but last Sunday when I was walking alone on that dyke, I
                    thought how good that Dutch soil was, and I felt something akin to ‘today it is
                    in mine heart to make a covenant with my God’ – because memories of times past
                    came back to me, including how often we walked with Pa to Rijsbergen and so on
                    in the last days of February and heard the lark above the black fields with
                    young green wheat, the shimmering blue sky with white clouds above – and then
                    the paved road with the beech trees – O Jerusalem Jerusalem! or rather O Zundert
                    O Zundert! Who knows but that we may go walking at the seaside together this
                    summer? We really must remain good friends, Theo, and simply believe in God and
                    trust with that faith of old in Him who is able to do above all that we ask or
                    think – who can say to what heights grace can ascend?</p>
                <p>Hearty congratulations for today, it’s already half past 1 and therefore already
                    8 February. May God spare our Father for us for a long time yet ‘and may He join
                    us intimately to one another and let our love of Him make that bond ever
                    stronger’.</p>
                <p>Pa wrote that he had already seen starlings, do you remember how they used to sit
                    on the church at Zundert? I haven’t seen any here yet – though there are a lot
                    of crows on the Grote Kerk in the mornings. Now it’s almost spring again and the
                    larks will return again. ‘He reneweth the face of the earth’ and it is written,
                    Behold, I make all things new, and just as He renews the face of the earth, so
                    can He renew and strengthen the human soul and heart and mind – the nature of
                    every true son somewhat resembles that of the son in the parable who ‘was dead,
                    and is alive again’. Let us not forget the words ‘sorrowful, yet alway
                    rejoicing’, ‘unknown, and yet well known’, and write the word woespiritedness as
                    two words, woe and spiritedness, and believe in God who in His own good time can
                    make the loneliness disappear which we sometimes feel so much even in the
                    bustle, of whom Joseph said ‘He hath made me forget my Father’s house and all my
                    sorrow’ – and yet Joseph did not forget his father – you know that of course,
                    but you also know what he meant by those words. Do keep well, give my regards to
                    everyone at the Rooses’, and especially to Mr Tersteeg and his wife, and accept
                    in thought a handshake, and believe me</p>

                <p>Tell Mr Tersteeg that he shouldn’t be upset about the drawing examples being away
                    for so long, it’s for the high school, 30 have already been chosen – but they
                    still want to select some for the secondary school, which is why they have to
                    keep them for another week or so. You’ll get them back as soon as possible.Old
                    boy, send me that page from Michelet again, the one you sent me earlier is in my

                <p>Write again soon if you can find a moment, remain steadfast, be of good heart,
                    and He shall strengthen thine heart. Wrote something for us last night which I
                    enclose herewith, read it sometime.</p>
                <p>Last night I left the office at 1 o’clock and walked around the Grote Kerk again
                    and then along the canals and past that old gate to the Nieuwe Kerk and then
                        home.<unstress reason="environment"> It had snowed and everything was so
                        still, the only thing one saw was a little light here and there in one or
                        two upstairs rooms and, in the snow, the black figure of the rattleman. It
                        was high tide, and the canals and boats looked dark against the snow. It can
                        be so beautiful there by those churches. The sky was grey and foggy, and the
                        moon shone faintly through it.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>Thought of you while I was walking, and upon arriving home I wrote what I’m
                    sending you. It’s perhaps a time when one needs ‘the sound of a psalm of the
                    past and a lamentation from the Cross’. Behold, I thought in the dead of
                    night</p>
                <p>To hear His voice, so tender, so soft. You have of course a De Génestet. Do read
                    it much and often.</p>
                <p>Pa sent me this once when I was in Paris: When I was a lad. When I was a lad, my
                    life carefree as ever</p>
                <p>I girt myself up, did whatever I chose,</p>
                <p>Free to go wand’ring, to seek, to endeavour,</p>
                <p>Free in my travels, my dreams, my repose. Even for me, though, the hour was
                    nearing</p>
                <p>Of calling, of mercy, of seriousness,</p>
                <p>When in my bosom the voice I’d been hearing</p>
                <p>Enquired ‘Do you love Me?’ – my soul answered ‘Yes’. Since that hour of waking my
                    dreams are no longer,</p>
                <p>Another now leads me, at times ’gainst my will,</p>
                <p>Teaches my hands to reach eagerly further,</p>
                <p>To follow and carry, oh, happy and still.Yet now that life’s governed by the
                    Supreme Being</p>
                <p>Despite pain and fetters, my soul torn apart –</p>
                <p>I find what in life I’d once vainly been seeking:</p>
                <p>More rest and more peace for my uneasy heart.There is no Priest who can
                    explain</p>
                <p>Him whom no one seeks in vain. Although into Elijah I cannot transform</p>
                <p>The Lord soared past me after the storm. Writing to you in haste between tasks,
                    adieu, a hearty handshake in thought from</p>

                <p>A prayer from the sons of the parsonage, from the children of the minister of the
                    gospel; from those who were blessed by their Father when they left their
                    parents’ house and for whom their Mother prayed that day, ‘Father, I pray not
                    that Thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that Thou shouldest keep
                    them from the evil’. A prayer from the children of many prayers, a prayer from
                    two brothers who slept together for so long in the little upstairs room in their
                    parents’ house. And they lifted up their voices, and wept. O Lord, we love the
                    light of Thy sun and the soughing of Thy sea; we lift up our eyes to Heaven and
                    love the stars that Thou bringest out their host by number and that Thou callest
                    all by name. We love the early morning hours when Thou makest Thy sun to rise on
                    the evil and on the good, and the evening hour and the setting of the sun speaks
                    to us of the evensong coming from our parents’ house: I know in whom my faith is
                    founded,</p>
                <p>Though day and night change constantly,</p>
                <p>I know the rock on which I’m grounded,</p>
                <p>My Saviour waits, unfailingly.</p>
                <p>When once life’s evening overcomes me,</p>
                <p>Worn down by ills and strife always,</p>
                <p>For every day Thou hast allowed me,</p>
                <p>I’ll bring Thee higher, purer praise. Happily the farmer returns from
                    ploughing,</p>
                <p>Bidding the gathering darkness goodday,</p>
                <p>So happy are we after all our toiling</p>
                <p>That the day will end without delay.</p>
                <p>Hope will not always fade forever. O Joy when now all grief is banned,</p>
                <p>The pilgrimage is long forgotten,</p>
                <p>And we are in the Promised Land. When we admire Thy works, however, ah! then we
                    feel it, even when we thank Thee for the beauty of Thy creation, that we cannot
                    find sufficient comfort for our life; the light of the sun and the glittering of
                    the stars, Lord, that is not it, that cannot fulfil us, we need a different and
                    better light – the light of the spirit and the mind that was in Jesus Christ –
                    Love of Thee, of Christ and of one another in Him – the light of a Love that can
                    constrain and can ignite the fire of fervour in our heart.</p>
                <p>We know that all labour is God’s labour, and that there is something good in all
                    labour, but even that is not it, and we are often inclined to ask, with an eye
                    to the beauty of nature, ‘turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity’, and with
                    an eye to our labour ‘we labour for that which does not satisfy and that which
                    does not fulfil’ – what does that mean: Labour not for the meat which perisheth,
                    but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life.</p>
                <p>There is a question in us – ‘What must we do to be saved?’ – and the answer to
                    that question is ‘Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved’. If
                    thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God, He shall save His
                    people from their sins. We are surrounded by temptations of all kinds, by perils
                    to the most precious thing we have, ‘our heart and our soul’. We are already far
                    enough along life’s path to know that we are composed of great afflictions and
                    needs and miseries, that we cannot stand with our own strength but only through
                    Thy mercy and through the protection of Thy Love and the guidance of Thy Spirit.
                    Into Thy hands, o Abba, Father! we commend our heart. Father, we pray not that
                    Thou shouldest take us out of the world, but we pray and beseech Thee to keep us
                    from the evil. Be Thou our keeper and our shade upon our right hand and teach us
                    to fear Thee and to keep Thee ever in front of our eyes. And unite my heart and
                    aim</p>
                <p>In Thy truth, to fear Thy Name. Thou knowest, O Lord, that we love Thy words with
                    an old, old, deeprooted, singular, fervent and very tender Love, that we believe
                    that Heaven and Earth shall pass away, but Thy words shall not pass away, and
                    that without the will of our heavenly Father not a hair can fall from our head.
                    We believe in Thee and we love Thee, and though we live in everyday things, yet
                    is the eye of our soul fixed on Thee, yea, our soul waiteth for the Lord, more
                    than they that watch for the morning. Still welcoming us, that blessed
                    night,</p>
                <p>In which the stars with beauteous light</p>
                <p>And heavenly hosts with one glad voice</p>
                <p>In Jesus’ coming do rejoice. He who leads us through this earthly vale,</p>
                <p>He whose love for us will never fail,</p>
                <p>He has pledged His Love and a faithful hand</p>
                <p>To speed our journey to the Promised Land. Burning centre of our longing,</p>
                <p>Comforter of troubled minds,</p>
                <p>Jesus, hymns of our thanksgiving</p>
                <p>Praise Thy fervent love that binds.</p>
                <p>From Heaven above Thou wouldst be sent</p>
                <p>To Earth, tainted and torn apart,</p>
                <p>And take upon Thyself the debt</p>
                <p>That weighs upon our fearful heart. Love for Thee is our whole being,</p>
                <p>Thou who art our highest good,</p>
                <p>For Thy Cross gives life its meaning,</p>
                <p>Eternally rejoice we should.</p>
                <p>O how much to Thee we’re bound,</p>
                <p>Jesus, Saviour, God’s own son,</p>
                <p>Our hearts and voices do resound</p>
                <p>To God on high, we sing as one. And yet, O Lord, at present we are poor, and full
                    of sorrow, and we quake at Thy word. Yea, we love Thy Bible and are sons of Thy
                    Bible. Thy folk is our folk and Thou art our God. Intreat us not to leave Thee,
                    to return from following after Thee, because Lord, to whom should we go? Thou
                    hast the words of Eternal Life. Whom have we in Heaven but Thee? And there is
                    none upon Earth that we desire beside Thee. Yea, we love the old stories and our
                    heart is burning within us when we read them or when we are mindful of them. We
                    quake at Thy words with inner emotion. God so loved the world, that he sent His
                    only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not be lost, but have
                    Everlasting Life. And this is life Eternal, to know Thee the only true God, and
                    Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast sent. And so he that hath not loved knoweth not
                    God; for God is Love. Love never faileth, but beareth all things, believeth all
                    things, hopeth all things, believeth all things. Well, Faith is the substance of
                    things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. And there is no fear in Love,
                    because perfect Love casteth out fear.</p>
                <p>Lord, what is man, that Thou art mindful of him? And the Son of man, that Thou
                    visitest him? We quake at Thy words with inner emotion, we who are uncomforted,
                    tossed with tempest. ‘I have loved Thee with an everlasting Love.’ Can a woman
                    forget her child? And if she should forget, yet will I not forget Thee. I will
                    comfort Thee as one whom his Mother comforteth. Lord, thou woundest, but Thy
                    hands makest whole. Thy ways are higher than our ways, and Thy thoughts are
                    higher than our thoughts, as high as Heaven is above earth. Thou, O Lord, canst
                    remove our transgressions from us as far as the east is from the west, and
                    though our sins be as scarlet, Thou, O Lord, canst make them white as snow. And
                    faithful art Thou that callest us, who also will do it. Thou, Thou alone art
                    able to do above all that we ask or think, and if mercy is shown us, who can say
                    to what heights mercy can ascend?</p>
                <p>Therefore, because we have so much need of Thee, just as the disciples of old, on
                    the road when evening had fallen and the sun had gone down, we constrain Thee,
                    saying, ‘Abide with us’. Make our hearts Thy dwellingplace, and give us that
                    other Comforter whom Thou hast promised to all who pray for Him, even the Spirit
                    of truth, who will guide us into truth. Thy Love to us is wonderful, Thy Love to
                    us is better than the love of women. Thou art a friend that sticketh closer than
                    a brother. We are as unknown, and yet well known to Thee, make us whole and
                    thoroughly sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing. Teach us to lift up the hands which
                    hang down, and to strengthen the feeble knees, teach us to arise when we have
                    fallen, and when we have sat in darkness, be unto us a light. We also love Thy
                    dark words: ‘those which sat in darkness and in the shadow of death saw great
                    light’, they saw in their mind’s eye Jesus Christ, and Him crucified and Him in
                    Gethsemane. They saw the image of the serpent lifted up by Moses in the
                    wilderness, and they saw and understood and came unto Thee that they might have
                    life. They beheld Thee and believed in Thee, and Thou hast given them the water
                    of life freely. Make us Christians too – teach us to know Christ in His full
                    worth and teach us the meaning of ‘Come unto Me, all ye that labour and are
                    heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of Me;
                    for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my
                    yoke is easy, and my burden is light’. And yet he who hate not, even his own
                    life also, he cannot be My disciple.</p>
                <p>Without Thee, O Eternal Being, oh, what would man on earth be? But Thou art come
                    to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind and
                    to heal the brokenhearted. Thou art come to seek that which was lost, and to be
                    a physician for them that are sick. Therefore we pray to Thee, O Christus
                    Consolator, saying, Heal us, and we shall be healed; turn us, and we shall be
                    turned; save us, and we shall be saved. Give us the best that there is in the
                    world and in life, the bond of Love to Thee, which never lets go of us, not even
                    when we suffer the most, and which even teaches us to take pleasure in
                    infirmities and distresses and necessities and afflictions of all kinds. Into
                    Thy hands we commend this, our very greatest good, which is life in reverent and
                    pious and simple communion with Thee in prayer.</p>
                <p>Give us the spirit of prayer and supplication to Thee. May experience of life
                    make our eye single and fix it on Thee more and more, make us worshippers in
                    spirit and in truth, make us the poor in Thy kingdom. Make that the love of Thee
                    constraineth us to examine Thy words zealously and make godly sorrow worketh a
                    choice for salvation not to be repented of. Thy word is a light unto our life’s
                    path and a lamp unto our feet. Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every
                    word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. Thou art the bread of life which
                    came down from Heaven, and whosoever desireth the living water of Thy word, it
                    shall become in him as a source of living water. Whosoever eateth of that bread
                    and drinketh of that water shall never hunger and never thirst for all eternity.
                    Let us not depart from this life without having professed openly in one way or
                    other our Love of Thee. O Lord, join us intimately to one another and let our
                    Love for Thee make that bond ever stronger. Deliver us from evil, especially the
                    evil of sin. Give us the holiness and the regeneration of which Thy scriptures
                    speak, in Thee all things can become new at all times. We also think that we
                    desire a good thing of Thee when we pray that Thou shouldest grant, IN THY TIME,
                    that we be given a ring on our finger and that we may meet her on our way and
                    that we may become men and fathers. Convey us to the opposite shore, O Lord,
                    because we cannot rest until we rest in Thee. When we were children, we spoke as
                    children, we understood as children, we thought as children, but now that we are
                    become men, help us to put away childish things. Yet Lord, keep our memory
                    green, yea evergreen.Ensure that for us, too, that hour is nearing</p>
                <p>Of calling, of mercy, and seriousness,</p>
                <p>That in our hearts the voice we are hearing</p>
                <p>Enquires ‘Do you love Me?’, our soul answers ‘Yes!’Because we are sons, Thou hast
                    sent forth the Spirit of Thy Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father. Again we
                    commend ourselves to Thy Love, into Thy hands we commit our heart and our life.
                    Be Thou the Hearer of our prayers and of those of our parents and let us not go
                    before giving us Thy blessing, not now or ever. Amen, yea, Amen. Psalm 42</p>
                <p>As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after God. My soul
                    thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I come and appear before God?
                    My tears have been my meat day and night, while they continually say unto me,
                    Where is thy God? When I remember these things, I pour out my soul in me: for I
                    had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of God, with the
                    voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that kept holyday.</p>
                <p>Why art thou cast down, O my soul? And why art thou disquieted in me? Hope thou
                    in God: for I shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance.</p>
                <p>O my God, my soul is cast down within me: therefore will I remember thee from the
                    land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites, from the hill Mizar.</p>
                <p>Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts: all thy waves and thy
                    billows are gone over me.</p>
                <p>Yet the Lord will command his lovingkindness in the daytime, and in the night his
                    song shall be with me, and my prayer unto the God of my life. I will say unto
                    God my rock, why hast thou forgotten me? Why go I mourning because of the
                    oppression of the enemy? As with a sword in my bones, mine enemies reproach me;
                    while they say daily unto me, Where is thy God?</p>
                <p>Why art thou cast down, O my soul? And why art thou disquieted within me? Hope
                    thou in God; for I shall yet praise Him, who is the health of my countenance,
                    and my God. Because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of His Son into
                    your hearts, crying to Him, Abba, Father. If thou art wretched, shamed,
                    perplexed,</p>
                <p>Then do not sin, renounce thy will</p>
                <p>Speak to thyself and mend thy ways</p>
                <p>And be in thy God meek and still. Though many ask in desperation</p>
                <p>Who will shew us any good?</p>
                <p>Lord, after fearful lamentation,</p>
                <p>Show us the sweet light of Thy face</p>
                <p>Grant us Thy favour and Thy grace. Psalm 23</p>
                <p>The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green
                    pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.</p>
                <p>He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for His name’s
                    sake.</p>
                <p>Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no
                    evil: for Thou art with me; Thy rod and Thy staff they comfort me.</p>
                <p>Thou preparest a table before me in my presence: Thou anointest my head with oil;
                    my cup runneth over.</p>
                <p>Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will
                    dwell in the house of the Lord for ever. Who rejoices in grey hair, and in the
                    words of the Lord, which are a light unto life’s path and a lamp unto our feet?
                    Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright: for the end of that man is peace.
                    ‘Nothing troubles his end. It’s the end of a fine day.’Psalm 25</p>
                <p>Unto Thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul. O my God, I trust in Thee: let me not be
                    ashamed. Shew me Thy ways, O Lord; teach me Thy paths. Lead me in Thy truth, and
                    teach me: for Thou art the God of my salvation; on Thee do I wait all the day.
                    Remember, O Lord, Thy tender mercies and Thy lovingkindnesses; for they have
                    been ever of old. Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions:
                    according to thy mercy remember thou me for Thy goodness’ sake, O Lord. Good is
                    the Lord and upright: therefore will He teach sinners in the way. The meek will
                    He guide in judgment: and the meek will He teach his way. All the paths of the
                    Lord are mercy and truth unto such as keep His covenant and His testimonies.</p>
                <p>For Thy name’s sake, pardon mine iniquity; for it is great. What man is he that
                    feareth the Lord? Him shall he teach in the way that he shall choose. His soul
                    shall dwell at ease; and his seed shall inherit the earth. The secret of the
                    Lord is with them that fear Him; and he will shew them His covenant. Mine eyes
                    are ever toward the Lord; for He shall pluck my feet out of the net.</p>
                <p>Turn Thee unto me, and have mercy upon me; for I am desolate and afflicted. The
                    troubles of my heart are enlarged: O bring thou me out of my distresses. Look
                    upon mine affliction and my pain; and forgive all my sins. Consider mine
                    enemies; for they are many; and they have something cruel against me. O KEEP MY
                    SOUL, and deliver me: let me not be ashamed; for I put my trust in Thee. Let
                    integrity and uprightness preserve me; for I wait on Thee.</p>
                <p>Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles. Many are the afflictions of the
                    righteous: but the Lord delivereth him out of them all. Make us masters, because
                    we are Thy faithful servants and Thy true worshippers in spirit and in truth.
                    Amen, yea, amen. Lord, take not Thy holy spirit away from the sons, from their
                    Father and from their Father’s house, and grant that they may stand before the
                    door of their own house before they know it, although they now say, how shall we
                    ever get there? Grant that we may live in that house for many days and that that
                    may be the way to ‘my Father’s house where there are many mansions’. Grant also
                    that we may stand before the door of that house before we know it, although we
                    shall often say ‘how shall we ever get there?’ and grant that we may live
                    therein with the blessed who called to us What you are now, I used to be,</p>
                <p>what I am now, you will one day be! Grant that the Love of Christ may constrain
                    us. Amen, yea, amen.Grant that we may meet her on our path, grant that one day
                    Mrs van Gogh sits before us in the carriage. Amen. Psalm 91</p>
                <p>He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the
                    shadow of the Almighty. I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortress:
                    my God; in Him will I trust. Surely He shall deliver thee from the snare of the
                    fowler, and from the noisome pestilence. He shall cover thee with His wings, and
                    under His wings shalt thou trust: His truth shall be thy shield and buckler.
                    Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flieth
                    by day; nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the destruction
                    that wasteth at noonday. A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at
                    thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee. Only with thine eyes shalt thou
                    behold and see the reward of the wicked. Because Thou hast made the Lord, which
                    is my refuge, even the most High, thy habitation; there shall no evil befall
                    thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling. For He shall command His
                    angels and give them charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways. They shall
                    bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone. Thou shalt
                    tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample
                    under feet. Because he hath set his love upon Me, saith God, therefore will I
                    deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known My name. He shall
                    call upon Me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in trouble; I will
                    deliver him, and honour him. With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my
                    salvation. Lord, do not let us go, except Thou bless us. Father, into Thy hands
                    we commend our Spirit, our soul and our heart, make us Christians and sorrowful,
                    yet alway rejoicing. Amen. What old friends we are already, let us always remain
                    so! Ps. 27:14.</p>

            <body>
                <p>Thanks for your letter, be of good heart, and He shall strengthen thine heart.
                    Today I received a long letter from home in which Pa asked me if it would suit
                    us both to go to Amsterdam next Sunday to visit Uncle Cor. If it’s all right
                    with you, then I’ll come to you in The Hague on Saturday evening on the train
                    that arrives a few minutes after 11, and in the morning we’ll take the first
                    train to Amsterdam and stay till evening.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="family">We ought to do it, Pa seems very keen on the idea,
                        then we’ll be together again next Sunday. It is possible, isn’t it, for me
                        to stay with you that night?</unstress> Otherwise I’ll go to the Toelast.
                    Write a postcard now if you agree, let us stick close together.</p>
                <p>Herewith a few words for Uncle Cor, add something to it if you like. It’s already
                    late, <unstress reason="environment">this afternoon I took a walk, because I
                        felt such a need to, first around the Grote Kerk, then the Nieuwe Kerk, and
                        then up onto the dyke where all those mills are that one sees in the
                        distance if one walks along the railway tracks. There is so much in that
                        singular landscape and vicinity that speaks and seems to say ‘be of good
                        courage, fear not’.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>There are days in one’s life when all members suffer because one member suffers,
                    and where there is true ‘godly sorrow,’ God is not far, He who will hold us. If
                    we believe that, let us, in those days, fervently desire and ask for things we
                    should like to see happen, that we might also be heard. <stress reason="career"
                        >Would you also ask for me that a way be found for me to devote my life,
                        more so than is now the case, to the service of Him and the gospel? I
                        continue to insist and I believe that I’ll be heard, I say this in all
                        humility and bowing myself down, as it were. It is such an import and such a
                        difficult matter, and yet I desire it.</stress> One might say it isn’t
                    humanly possible, but if I think about it more seriously and delve beneath the
                    surface of what is humanly impossible, then truly my soul waiteth upon God, for
                    it is possible for Him who speaks, and it is done, who commands, and it stands,
                    and it stands fast. <bad_health>O Theo, Theo, old boy, if only it might happen
                        to me and that deluge of downcastness about everything which I undertook and
                        failed at, that torrent of reproaches I’ve heard and felt, if it might be
                        taken away from me and if I might be given the opportunity and the strength
                        and the love required to develop and to persevere and to stand firm in that
                        for which my Father and I would offer the Lord such heartfelt
                        thanks.</bad_health> A handshake in thought and regards to everyone at the
                    Rooses’, ask it for me in this thy day, and believe me</p>

            <body>
                <p>Thanks for your letter, want to make sure you receive a few words in Amsterdam.
                        <unstress reason="family">We’ll see each other Sunday, I hope, and it will
                        be good for us to be together again.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>My hearty congratulations to you on Willemien’s birthday, what a nice girl she’s
                    become. From Pa and Ma she’s getting ‘de wijde wijde wereld’, and from me ‘het
                    Kerstfeest aan de pool’ by Bungener. I’m glad for you that you left on your trip
                    so soon, that makes for a good change.</p>
                <p>
                    <good_health>I’m so sad and so alone, you say. ‘And yet I am not alone, because
                        the Father is with me’. ‘Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the
                        world’.</good_health>
                </p>
                <p>Holding fast in all places and in all circumstances to the thought of Christ,
                    that is a good thing. ‘I set the Lord before me alway, the Lord is my keeper, He
                    is the shade upon my right hand’, said David. What a hard life the farmers in
                    Brabant have; Aarssen, for example, where does their strength come from? And
                    those poor women, what is the support in their lives? Might it not be that image
                    of Christ, the wondrous power and attraction of that name? Might it not be what
                    the painter painted in his ‘Light of the world’? I cannot tell you how much I
                    sometimes yearn for the Bible. I do read something out of it every day, but I’d
                    so much like to know it by heart and to see life in the light of that word of
                    which it is said: Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.</p>
                <p>
                    <good_health>I believe and trust that my life will still be changed, and that
                        that longing for Him will be satisfied.</good_health>
                    <bad_health>I, too, am sometimes sad and alone, especially when I walk around a
                        church or a parsonage.</bad_health>

                <p>‘A poor man in the kingdom of heaven’, that is a name that attracts a man and is
                    a gospel to him. Let us not give up and go on seeking meekness and
                    longsuffering.</p>
                <p>And be true to your own nature and be separate, distinguish between good and evil
                    even if you don’t show it. Do it for yourself.</p>
                <p>‘Do not leave this life without having given evidence in one way or other of your
                    love for Christ’, says Claudius.</p>
                <p>You’ve had an experience that can make you wise your whole life long, do hold
                    that fast which thou hast.</p>
                <p>Feed me with the bread of my tears, truth, teach me. And it also says: ‘The
                    sacrifices of God are a broken heart and a broken spirit; a broken heart, O God,
                    thou wilt not despise’. HATE sin, be discerning, do you remember how Pa used to
                    pray every morning ‘Preserve us from all evil, especially the evil of sin’? And
                    he certainly knows. And it also says: he who hate not, yea his own life also, he
                    cannot be My disciple. I’m longing for Sunday, I hope you’ll have a good trip,
                    working is always a wonderful thing, and there is something good in all
                    labour.</p>
                <p>
                    <good_health>Am still busy until late at night, but glad it’s like
                        this.</good_health>
                </p>
                <p>Be sure to give my regards to Uncle Cor and Aunt. There are storks here already,
                    but I haven’t heard any larks yet. It’s often stormy, and then one sees swarms
                    of crows and starlings.</p>
                <p>The photograph of Mater Dolorosa that you sent is hanging in my room, how
                    beautiful it is. Do you remember it hanging in Pa’s study at Zundert?</p>
                <p>Now Theo, I wish you the very best, we’ll be seeing each other soon, I’m longing
                    to see the prints you wrote about, accept a handshake in thought, see you
                    Sunday, adieu, and believe me</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Want to make sure you receive a letter on your trip. <unstress reason="family"
                        >What a good day we spent together in Amsterdam, I stood there watching the
                        train you left in as long as it was still in sight. We’re such old friends,
                        aren’t we? How long we’ve walked together, starting in the black fields with
                        the young green wheat at Zundert, where we heard the lark at this time of
                        year with Pa.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="family">In the morning I went with Uncle Cor to see Uncle
                        Stricker, where we had a long talk about youknowwhat. In the evening at half
                        past six Uncle Cor brought me to the station, it was a beautiful evening and
                        in everything there was so much that seemed to speak, the weather was still
                        and there was a bit of mist in the streets, as is usually the case in
                        London. Uncle had toothache that morning, but fortunately it didn’t last, we
                        went to the flower market too, it’s good to love flowers and pine branches
                        and ivy and hedges of hawthorn, we have seen them from the very
                        beginning.</unstress> Wrote home about how we had spent our time in
                    Amsterdam and what we talked about. Arriving here I found a letter from home at
                    Rijken’s. Pa was unable to preach last Sunday and the Rev. Kam stood in for him
                    – <stress reason="career">I know that his heart is burning within him that
                        something might happen so that I could give myself over not only almost but
                        altogether to following Him, Pa always hoped I would do so, oh! may it come
                        to pass, and may there be a blessing on it.</stress> The print that you gave
                    me of ‘Heaven and earth shall pass away, but My words shall not pass away’ and
                    the portrait of the Rev. Heldring are already hanging in my room, oh,
                        <good_health>I’m so glad to have them, they give me hope.</good_health> Am
                    writing to you offhand about my plans; my idea becomes clear and firm by doing
                    so. For the time being I’m thinking of the words ‘it is my portion to keep Thy
                    word’, have such a desire to familiarize myself with the treasure of biblical
                    scripture, to know all those old stories thoroughly and lovingly, especially to
                    learn what we know about Christ. In our family, which is indeed a Christian
                    family in the full sense of the word, there has always been a minister of the
                    gospel as far back as one can see, from generation to generation. <stress
                        reason="career">Why should that voice not be heard in this and in following
                        generations? Why should a member of that family not now feel himself called
                        to that office and think, with some reason, that he can and must declare
                        himself and seek the means to achieve that goal? It is my prayer and deepest
                        desire that the spirit of my Father and Grandfather may rest upon me, and
                        that it may be given me to be a Christian and a Christian labourer, that my
                        life may resemble that of them whom I name – the more, the better – for
                        behold, that old wine is good and I desire not the new.</stress> Their God
                    shall be my God, and their people my people, that this may be my portion: to
                    know Christ in His full worth and to be constrained by His love. What that Love
                    is, is so beautifully said in the words ‘as sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing’, and
                    in 1 Cor. XIII, it beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things,
                    endureth all things, it never faileth. It is in my heart today, those words of
                    the pilgrims going to Emmaus when evening was come and the sun had gone down,
                    ‘But they constrained Him, saying, Abide with us’.</p>
                <p>You like it too, that ‘sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing’, keep it in mind, because
                    they are good words and a good cloak in the storm of life, keep it in mind at
                    this time, now that you’ve experienced so much lately. And be careful, because
                    even though it’s no small thing that you’ve experienced, yet, if I see rightly,
                    there is something greater in store, and you too will remember the words of the
                    Lord: I have loved thee with an everlasting Love, I will comfort you as one whom
                    his mother comforteth. I shall send you another Comforter, even the Spirit of
                    truth, I will make a new covenant with you, be separate, and touch not the
                    unclean thing, I will be your God, and you shall be My people, I will be a
                    Father unto you, and you shall be My sons and daughters. Hate sin and the places
                    where it resides, and come not nigh, it attracts so easily with a false
                    appearance of being something great, and does what the devil did to Christ when
                    he showed Him all the kingdoms of the earth and their glory and said, ‘All these
                    things will I give Thee, if Thou wilt kneel down and worship me’. There is
                    something better than the glory of worldly things: it is the feeling we get when
                    our heart burns within us upon hearing His word, it is faith in God, the Love of
                    Christ, faith in immortality, in a life after this life. Hold fast to what you
                    have. Theo, old boy, brother whom I love, <stress reason="career">I have such a
                        great longing for that thing which you know of, but how shall I ever get it?
                        How I wish that I, like Pa, had already done a lot of the difficult work of
                        a Christian labourer and minister of the gospel and sower of the
                        word.</stress> You see, Pa can count his services and Bible readings and
                    visits to the sick and the poor and his written sermons by the thousands, and
                    still he doesn’t look back but goes on doing good. Lift up your eyes for me and
                    pray that it may be given to me, just as I now do for you, may He give you the
                    desires of thine heart, He who knows us better than we know ourselves and who is
                    able to do above all that we ask or think, for His ways are higher than our ways
                    and His thoughts are higher than our thoughts, as high as the Heaven is above
                    the earth. And may you continue to think of Christ as a Comforter and God as a
                    refuge.</p>
                <p>I wish you well on your trip; write soon, and accept a handshake in thought,
                    adieu, and believe me ever</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo, </salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Want to make sure you get a letter quickly, I’m writing to you again from Etten,
                    as you see.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="friendship">Yesterday morning I got a letter from Pa in which Pa
                        wrote that Aertsen was dying and how Pa had been there again, as he wished
                        to see and speak to Pa again. When I heard that, my heart was drawn to
                        Zundert so strongly that I felt the need to go there again.</stress> But
                    more about this later – I just read your last letter and saw that your trip is
                    over and you’re back in The Hague. Do write to me again soon, too, and let’s
                    remain close to one another.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="family">Today a postcard from Anna to say she arrived safely,
                        may things go well for her. Haven’t you also noticed that something has come
                        over her that recalls the women who loved Jesus of whom the Bible
                        tells.</unstress> And every time I think of her I am reminded of the words
                    of Béranger: </p>
                <p>In palaces and under thatch,</p>
                <p>The Virgin said, with my hands</p>
                <p>I have prepared honey and balm</p>
                <p>For mankind’s suffering. And how sweet she was in that family in Welwyn, sharing
                    their joys and sorrows, keeping nothing back of what she had in her to be a help
                    and comfort to them, also during the time that child there was sick and died; I
                    saw so clearly how everyone there loved her. She did her very best from the
                    start, getting up early in the winter to make the fire with her own hands, even
                    though the first days weren’t easy and she wrote that she was thinking: Without
                    Thee, O Eternal Being, oh, what would become of man on earth? Whom have I in
                    heaven but Thee? And there is none upon earth that I desire beside Thee. And how
                    she wanted so much to attend the Lord’s Supper, and went there and found
                    strength in it. And Pa and Ma love her so much, and we all do too, yes, do let’s
                    stay close to one another.</p>
                <p>On Saturday evening I left on the last train from Dordrecht to Oudenbosch and
                    walked from there to Zundert.<unstress reason="environment"> It was so beautiful
                        there on the heath, even though it was dark one could make out the heath and
                        the pinewoods and the marshes stretching far and wide, it reminded me of
                        that illustration by Bodmer that’s hanging in Pa’s study. The sky was grey
                        but the evening star shone through the clouds, and now and then other stars
                        were visible too.</unstress> It was still very early when I arrived at the
                    cemetery in Zundert, where it was so quiet, I went to have a look at all the old
                    places and paths and waited for the sun to rise. You know the story of the
                    Resurrection, everything there reminded me of it in that quiet cemetery this
                    morning. <stress reason="friendship">I heard from Aertsen and Mientje, as soon
                        as they were up, that their Father had died that night, oh, they were so sad
                        and their hearts were so full, for Hein also arrived there early.</stress>
                    <good_health>I was glad to be there; I sympathized with them because I had also
                        been so fond of the man.</good_health>
                </p>
                <p>The aunts send you their regards, and Jan Doome too, whom I also went to see.
                    From there I walked with Hein to Rijsbergen, and was in the house around an hour
                    and we read together. Woutje Prins had also sat up for 3 nights with the
                    deceased, and had stood by him till the last. His passing was peaceful.</p>
                <p>I’ll never forget that noble head lying there on the pillow; one saw, besides the
                    signs of suffering, an expression of peace and something holy. Oh, it was so
                    beautiful, I’d say that it spoke of all the singularity this land has and the
                    life of these Brabant folk.</p>
                <p>And they were all so full of praise for Pa and what Pa had always been to them,
                    and how fond those two were of each other.</p>
                <p>Then I walked with Hein Aertsen to Etten and am now at home, leaving early
                    tomorrow morning.</p>
                <p>Goodbye, old boy, it’s time for the post, accept a handshake in thought and
                    believe me, after giving my regards to all your housemates,</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Thanks for your letter of yesterday, which I answer today, having an hour of
                    time.</p>
                <p>Remembered that when we were at the Van der Hoop Museum we talked about the book
                    by Bürger, which you’ll be receiving in the post, in it you’ll also find a
                    woodcut after G. Doré, Judith and Holofernes, and one after Brion &amp;c. for
                    your scrapbook. Do go on with it, because you’ll turn it into something
                    beautiful in time.</p>
                <p>Do accept my small contribution, I need so much to commune with you by way of
                    such trifles; <unstress reason="family">when I come back to my room I’m reminded
                        of you again and again by the illustrations on the wall.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>The love between brothers is a great support in life, that is an ageold truth,
                    let us seek that support, let the fire of love between us not be extinguished,
                    but let instead the experience of life make that bond ever stronger, let us
                    remain upright and candid with each other, let there be no secrets – as things
                    stand today.</p>
                <p>Thanks for your last letter. ‘It’s not over yet’, you say – no, it cannot be over
                    yet. Your heart will need to trust itself and to pour forth – you’ll be torn
                    between the two – her and my Father – I think that our Father loves you more
                    than she does – that his love is worth more – these words are ‘fine gold’:The
                    child puts great faith in his Father</p>
                <p>As befits the father’s worth.</p>
                <p>For who is closer than thy Father, is he nearer</p>

                    <stress reason="family">This week I got a letter from Uncle Vincent, who wrote
                        that he thought it unnecessary to continue the correspondence, that he
                        cannot help me in this matter.</stress> A letter came at the same time from
                    Mr Gladwell, in which he wrote about Harry – who must have endured much anguish,
                    being very hard pressed to make him act as he did.</p>
                <p>Mr Görlitz is in Etten today to talk to Pa about the vacancy for a teaching post
                    at Leur. I sincerely hope he’ll get it. Today was the first early sermon, which
                    I attended, the sermon was very beautiful, about Jesus showing himself to the
                    disciples at the sea of Tiberias, John 21. Herewith a few poems by Uhland which
                    I found moving. Do write soon, old boy, give my warm regards to your housemates,

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>I received your letter of 21 April, thanks for writing so quickly –
                        <good_health>and that letter gave me a feeling of joy such as the woman must
                        have had who found the piece of silver she had lost,</good_health> namely,
                    you wrote that Aunt Koos’s little readingdesk containing Pa and Ma’s letters was
                    found at the Rooses’ when the house was being cleaned.</p>
                <p>What fear and worry I felt last year, looking for it and imagining that I’d taken
                    it to England and that it got left behind at one of the houses I stayed at in
                    London. It’s wonderful that it has turned up, I’m so grateful, keep it for the
                    time being, I’ll be needing it in Amsterdam when I’m ‘on the way’.</p>
                <p>I now remember very clearly having left it behind at the Rooses’ when I left for
                    England, because there wasn’t much room in my trunk and also because I thought
                    it would be safer there than travelling with me in foreign parts.</p>
                <p>It seems to me to be new proof, as it were, and a sign like others that I think
                    I’ve been noticing recently, that my efforts will be blessed, that things will
                    go well for me, and the thing I desire so fervently will be granted me –
                    something of the faith of old has come alive in me that my thoughts shall be
                    established and a right spirit renewed and the soul restored to the old faith. I
                    alone am making a choice for my life. Set your heart and mind, you too, on
                    something good, on a good cause, and desire it of the Lord.</p>
                <p>Uncle Jan was in Etten and said that my room was already ready. Mr Braat is
                    negotiating with someone, so in May I’ll probably put my hand to the plough.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="family">Hanging in that little room will be the prints I got
                        from you, and so I’ll be reminded of you daily</unstress> – beneath that one
                    after Rosenthal, that monk, I have written ‘Take my yoke upon you, and learn of
                    Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.
                    For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light. Whosoever will come after Me, let
                    him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me – in the kingdom of
                    heaven they do not marry, and are not given in marriage’. Beneath its pendant,
                    The imitation of Jesus Christ (after Ruipérez), I wrote what we used to hear Pa
                    say: ‘Lord, I should so much like to be earnest’.This morning I heard a very
                    beautiful sermon by the Rev. Keller van Hoorn on ‘and that from a child thou
                    hast known the scriptures’. <unstress reason="friendship">This afternoon
                        Görlitz, Mager, Ten Broek and I went to the museum to see the Scheffers –
                        they’re really beautiful.</unstress> Have I already told you that Görlitz
                    went to Etten to apply for the teaching position that has fallen vacant in
                    Leur?</p>
                <p>He came back filled with everything he had seen there. Pa had given a sermon on
                    Jacob who slept in the field at Bethel, and he had found it all so moving.</p>
                <p>I’d be happy for him if he got the position; then he would probably marry very
                    soon.</p>
                <p>Last week I got a letter from Harry Gladwell himself. Something has happened to
                    him, a little different, admittedly, and yet essentially the same as what
                    happened to you, and he is in dangerous surroundings there – the fowlers are
                    many and clever. I hope to hear more soon, and we’ll talk about it sometime.</p>
                <p>I know little of Taine’s life, I assume that he travelled a lot in France, Italy,
                    England and also Holland, one could deduce as much from his writings. He is
                    certainly an artist. I still have the first book by Bürger, Musées. Now, Theo,
                    have a nice Sunday today. I hope to see you if I go to Amsterdam.</p>
                <p>For a ‘sower of the word’ as I hope to become, sufficient unto the day is the
                    evil thereof, just like for a sower of corn in the field – and the earth shall
                    bring forth all manner of thorns and thistles – do let’s continue to support
                    each other and to seek brotherly love.</p>
                <p>Adieu, give my regards to your housemates, and accept a handshake in thought, and
                    believe me ever</p>

                <p>It’s raining here today and one could imagine oneself in London. But how green
                    everything outside is becoming. This morning Görlitz, Ten Broek and I went for a
                    walk while it was still early. <unstress reason="environment">Isn’t it beautiful
                        in the Scheveningen Bosjes as well? Shall we walk there together again, and
                        on the beach? I hope so! When I go to post this I hope to take that small
                        path behind the station again where we walked together.</unstress> See Luke

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>My hearty congratulations on this day, many happy returns, have a good day
                    tomorrow, and many good days in the year you’re now beginning. Time passes
                    quickly and the days fly past – yet something can remain and the past isn’t
                    entirely lost – <good_health>we can become richer and firmer of spirit, of
                        character, of heart, we can become richer in God, we can become richer in
                        the fine gold of life, the love for one another and the feeling ‘and yet I
                        am not alone, because the Father is with me’.</good_health> May it be so for
                    all of us, it is a good prayer, that one of Father’s: O Lord, join us intimately
                    to one another and let our love for Thee make that bond ever stronger.</p>
                <p>I hope to see you soon, because when I go to Amsterdam I’m planning to stop in
                    The Hague for a while. Don’t tell anyone about this, though, because my main
                    purpose in doing so is to see you. </p>
                <p> I’m going to Etten this Wednesday, to stay there for a few days before putting
                    my hand to the plough. </p>
                <p> I should have liked you to be here yesterday; in the morning I heard the Rev.
                    Hooyer’s farewell sermon in the little French church. The church was full, he
                    spoke with fire and feeling, <unstress reason="environment">I was moved by the
                        sight of that distinguished, singular congregation, the mood was very
                        earnest.</unstress> He thanked them for the love that he had received from
                    many of them, especially at difficult times, in the beginning, four years ago,
                    when he was wrestling with the difficulties of speaking in French, because he’s
                    a Dutchman. There were various other clergymen in the congregation. </p>
                <p> In the afternoon I went to the Grote Kerk to hear the Rev. Keller van Hoorn,
                    whose text was ‘Our Father’; in the evening I heard the Rev. Greeff, whom I’d
                    heard on my first Sunday evening here in Dordrecht. By chance, he took for his
                    sermon yesterday the same text he had taken that first time: Now we see through
                    a glass, darkly; now I know in part, but then shall I know even as also I am
                    known. </p>
                <p> After church I walked along that path behind the station where we walked
                    together, thinking of you and wishing we could be together – and kept on walking
                    until I came to the cemetery at the end of a black cinder road running through
                    the meadows that looked so beautiful in the twilight. <unstress
                        reason="environment">The cemetery looks a little like that drawing by Apol
                        in ‘Eigen Haard’, there’s a canal around it and there’s a house surrounded
                        by pine trees, yesterday evening the light was shining through the windows
                        in such a friendly way – it’s an old house that looks like a
                        parsonage.</unstress> There can still be much good in store for both of us,
                    let us learn to say after Pa ‘I never despair’ and after Uncle Jan ‘the devil is
                    never so black that one cannot look him in the face’. </p>
                <p> Write again soon, this Wednesday, then, I’ll be in Etten. Do you have De Plancy,
                    Légendes des artistes, with woodcuts after Rochussen? I hope to bring it for
                    you. </p>
                <p> These last few days I’ve managed, in between times, to work my way through the
                    whole story of Christ from a catechism book written by Uncle Stricker, and I
                    copied out the texts, which brought to mind so many paintings by Rembrandt and
                    others. It is, I believe and trust, a choice not to be repented of, which I’ve
                    made in an attempt to become a Christian and a Christian labourer. Yes, all
                    things of the past can work together for good, familiarity with cities like
                    London and Paris and life in such places as that school in Ramsgate and in
                    Isleworth makes one more drawn and attached to many things and such books of the
                    Bible as The Acts of the Apostles. Knowing and loving the work and life of such
                    men as Jules Breton, Millet and Jacque, Rembrandt, Bosboom and so many others,
                    can also be a source of ideas. What a similarity there is between the work and
                    life of Pa and that of such men; that of Pa I rate even higher. </p>
                <p> God help us, old boy, He can make you and all of us and me say, Lord, it is
                    enough. </p>
                <p>Adieu, accept a handshake in thought and again, hearty congratulations from</p>

            <body>
                <p>Thanks for your letter and for the church’s attestation, it’s a pity you didn’t
                    go to Etten for Whitsun; I sincerely hope you’ll be able to go one Sunday soon.
                    Did you get the attestation easily? Thanks for taking the trouble. </p>
                <p> Yesterday morning I went to the early service and heard a sermon, ‘I shall not
                    always strive with man’, how after a time of disappointment and grief in life a
                    time may come when one’s innermost desires and wishes may be fulfilled. At 10 in
                    the morning I heard Uncle Stricker on Acts II:14, the pouring forth of the Holy
                    Spirit. A very beautiful, warm address from the heart; this morning I’m going to
                    hear Uncle again and must go now, I’ll write and tell you presently what his
                    text was. </p>
                <p> It’s rainy today, and a long walk along Buitenkant to the Noorderkerk. <unstress
                        reason="environment">There, by the Schreijerstoren, where one has a view of
                        the IJ, the city looked like a painting by J. Maris.</unstress> The text was
                    I Corinthians 12:13, For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body. There
                    are some beautiful churches here. This week I walked as far as the Zuiderzee on
                    a dyke going to Zeeburg. This takes one past the Jodenkerkhof, which I visited
                    as well. It’s very simple, full of old tombstones standing upright with Hebrew
                    inscriptions and elderberries here and there, and covered with long, dark grass.
                        <unstress reason="environment">Yesterday (Sunday) afternoon I went with
                        Uncle Jan to Baarn, how beautiful it is there, we walked in the wood in the
                        avenues of spruce and beech trees and saw the sun go down behind the oak
                        copse. You can imagine how beautiful it is in the evening, around the time
                        we came home yesterday, for example, at the wharf and the dockyard and the
                        shore of the IJ, and there’s such a glorious smell of tar in the air that
                        reminds one of pinewoods. </unstress>
                </p>
                <p> Yesterday Uncle gave me some old black gloves and scarves. Thought we’d share
                    them in brotherly fashion. You’ll receive them in a day or two as ‘samples
                    without value’, because black gloves are a good thing, good like ivy, for
                    example, and ‘mosses green and lichens fair’, and good like the fixed habit of
                    going to church. </p>
                <p> This afternoon I’m going to Uncle Stricker’s, who asked me to come, Vos, Kee and
                    Paul’s girl will be there too. </p>
                <p> Do you know an old English engraving ‘The vicar’s daughter’? It’s hanging at
                    Baarn and struck me yesterday; look out for it if you come to Baarn. Its
                    atmosphere recalls Die Abendglocke. </p>
                <p> Nevertheless, I find it such a pity that there, as well as in Uncle Jan’s best
                    rooms, there is nothing hanging like Christus Consolator or Ecce Homo. The
                    latter is hanging in your room, surely, at least I thought I noticed it there.
                    Do make a habit of hanging it up everywhere you live, for that is right and is
                    your due. </p>
                <p> This morning in church I saw a little old woman, probably the footstove woman,
                    who reminded me so much of that etching by Rembrandt, a woman who has been
                    reading the Bible and has fallen asleep leaning her head on her hand. C. Blanc
                    writes about it so beautifully and with so much feeling, and I think Michelet
                    does as well in his: there is no such thing as an old woman. The poem by De
                    Génestet, ‘Haar pad in ’t leven loopt eenzaam af’ also reminds me of it. Will we
                    also find ourselves in the evening of our life before we know it, as it were? –
                    when we feel the days flying by, passing ever more quickly – it helps me to
                    believe and trust that ‘man proposes, but God disposes’. </p>
                <p> Were you at the gallery in the mornings over the Whitsun holidays? I do hope you
                    had a good time all the same. </p>
                <p> 22 May. Yesterday evening I was at Uncle Stricker’s, where it was very
                    convivial. Vos, Kee, Paul’s girl and Jan were there, and it was after 11 when I
                    got home, then I wrote until 12, how I wish that we could go to places together,
                    I’d have liked you to be with us last night.Do write a few words again soon,
                    when you have a moment. <good_health>This morning I still have a lot of work to
                        do, I see that it isn’t easy and will no doubt become much more difficult,
                        yet have unfaltering hope that I’ll succeed, and I’m also convinced that
                        I’ll learn to work by working, and that my work will become better and more
                        substantial.</good_health> I’ve already begun studying the Bible, but only
                    in the evenings, when I’ve finished my work for the day, or early in the morning
                    – after all, that’s the most important thing – even though it’s now my duty to
                    dedicate myself to studying other things, which I do, of course.Yesterday at the
                    Strickers’ I had to tell them about London and Paris, and whenever I do that I
                    see it all before me again, all things from that past can also work together for
                    good, I’m fond of much there, and that, ah, I’ve experienced that everywhere
                    I’ve been, I also feel that when I walk the streets of The Hague or Zundert, for
                    example, I shan’t easily forget that last journey there. Before I went to the
                    Strickers’ I walked briefly through the Trippenhuis in order to see several
                    paintings again, I’m sure you know which ones. </p>
                <p>Now, Theo, give my regards to one person or another you might see, write soon, I
                    wish you the very best, accept a firm handshake in thought, and believe me.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p> Today Uncle Jan found some clothes that were Hendrik’s which he’s grown out of,
                    and asked if I could use them, and I said if I might share them with you I’d
                    gladly take them. So herewith a pair of duffle trousers which may well be of use
                    to you in the autumn and winter, by which time you’ll likely be in need of them.
                    I have a black pair. </p>
                <p> Today was stormy, on my way to my lessons this morning I looked towards the
                    Zuiderzee from the bridge. There was one white stripe on the horizon with dark
                    grey clouds above it, the rain pouring down from them in slanting lines in the
                    distance, standing out against this was the long row of houses with the
                    Oosterkerk. </p>
                <p> Uncle Jan went to Leiden yesterday, so I was alone that day. In the morning I
                    went to the Oosterkerk and heard a sermon on Isaiah 55:8 and 9, ‘For My thoughts
                    are not your thoughts, neither are your ways My ways, saith the Lord. For as the
                    Heavens are higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than your ways, and My
                    thoughts higher than your thoughts’. </p>
                <p> Walked to the seaside in the afternoon, and spent the rest of the day writing.
                        <stress reason="career">The work and writing don’t yet go as fast and easily
                        as I’d wish,</stress> but I hope to learn by practice, but, old boy, if I
                    could I’d like to skip over a few years, <unstress reason="love">though I trust
                        that I shall succeed and that my lips shall speak the fullness of preaching
                        the gospel and that my hand shall write it, and I pray that that be given
                        me, but first one must get some rest when one already has several years of
                        work behind one and feels one is on the way and is doing the same thing as
                        those whom one loves.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p> This morning I was in Uncle Stricker’s study, it’s beautiful and he has a
                    portrait of Calvin after Ary Scheffer hanging there, although I should have
                    liked very much to see more prints on the wall. Last week I got as far as Gen.
                    XXIII, the burial of Sarah in the field that Abraham bought to bury her there in
                    the cave of Machpelah, and <work origin="new" stage="sketch">I couldn’t help
                        making a little drawing of how I imagined that place to be, it’s nothing
                        very special but I’m enclosing it anyway.</work>
                </p>
                <p> A good letter from home yesterday, wrote back today, also to Anna. You must also
                    write again soon, for I’m longing to hear from you. </p>
                <p> Right now all the people are leaving the dockyard to go home, that’s nice to
                    see. One hears them already early in the morning, I think there are around 3,000
                    of them, the sound of their footsteps is something like the sound of the sea.
                    This morning bought from a Jew ‘Tobias’ after Rembrandt, a small engraving, for
                    six cents. </p>
                <p> Uncle Jan sends you many regards, write him a word or two, or else write a
                    sentence in a letter to me that I can read to him to thank him for the clothes. </p>
                <p> How is Mrs Tersteeg doing? I’m also eager to hear whether you’ve been to see
                    Mauve. </p>
                <p> Aunt Mina and Paul’s girl will soon be going to Etten, that will be nice for
                    them at home. Pa wrote that the church had been whitewashed and the organ
                    painted. Yesterday 3 children were baptized. Lips is still no better, and Willem
                    van Eekelen’s wife is also very ill. Did you hear that Uncle Vincent has
                    bronchitis again, and it seems to be serious? It’s fortunate that Uncle is back
                    in the country, and in his own house, and that Pa and Ma visit him almost every
                    day. </p>
                <p>Now, old boy, I wish you the very best, give my regards to your housemates,
                    please forgive me for not being able to pay the postage on the parcel, old chap,
                    do write soon and accept in thought a hearty handshake, and believe me</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Thanks for your letter of today, I have to do a few things and so am writing in
                    haste. Gave your letter to Uncle Jan, accept his warm regards and he thanks you
                    for writing.</p>
                <p>
                    <bad_health>There were some words in your letter that touched me, ‘I should
                        really like to get away from everything, I’m the cause of everything and
                        only make others sad, I alone have caused all this misery to myself and
                        others’. Those were words that touched me – because that same feeling,
                        exactly the same, nothing more and nothing less, is also on my
                        conscience.</bad_health>
                </p>
                <p>When I think of the past – when I think of the future, <bad_health>of nearly
                        insurmountable difficulties, of much and difficult work which I have no
                        passion for</bad_health>, which I – <bad_health>the evil part of
                        me</bad_health>, that is – would prefer to avoid, when I think of the eyes
                    of so many that are fixed upon me – who, if I do not succeed, will know the
                    reason why – <stress reason="career">who will not utter any ordinary reproaches
                        but who, because they have been tried and are well versed in what is good
                        and proper and fine gold, as it were, will say it by the expression on their
                        faces: we helped you and have been a light unto you – we did for you what we
                        could. Did you sincerely desire it? What are our wages and the fruits of our
                        labours? You see, when I think of all that and of so much else, all manner
                        of things – too many to mention, of all the troubles and worries which do
                        not become less as one progresses through life, of suffering, of
                        disappointment, of the danger of failing to a scandalous extent, then that
                        desire is no stranger to me either – I would really like to get away from
                        everything!</stress>
                </p>
                <p>And yet – I go on – but with caution and in the hope that I’ll succeed in warding
                    off all these things, so that I can somehow answer all the reproaches that
                    threaten, <good_health>trusting that in spite of everything that seems to be
                        against me I shall attain that thing that I desire, and, God willing, shall
                        find grace in the eyes of some whom I love, and in the eyes of those who
                        shall come after me.</good_health>
                </p>
                <p>It is written, lift up the feeble hands, and the knees which hang down, and when
                    the disciples had toiled all night and had taken nothing, it was said unto them,
                    Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets again.</p>
                <p>
                    <bad_health>My head is sometimes numb and is often burning hot, and my thoughts
                        are confused</bad_health> – <stress reason="career">how shall I ever get all
                        that difficult and detailed study into it?</stress> – I don’t know – after
                    those turbulent years, becoming accustomed to plain, well-ordered work and
                    persevering in it isn’t always easy. <stress reason="career">And yet I go on, if
                        we’re tired, isn’t it because we’ve already gone a long way, and if it’s
                        true that man’s life on earth is a struggle, isn’t feeling tired and having
                        a burning head a sign that we have struggled?</stress> When one labours at
                    difficult work and strives for good results, one fights the good fight, the
                    reward of which, surely, is already this: that one is preserved from much that
                    is evil. And God beholds the labour and the sorrow, and can help in spite of
                    everything. </p>
                <p>
                    <good_health>Faith in God is for me a certainty</good_health> – not some notion,
                    not an idle belief, it is so, it is true – there is a God that lives – and He is
                    with our parents, and his eye is also upon us, and I am certain that He intends
                    us for something, and that we do not belong entirely to ourselves, as it were –
                    and that God is none other than Christ of Whom we read in our Bible, whose word
                    and story are also deep in your heart. <stress reason="career">If only I had
                        worked at it sooner with all my might, yes, it would be better for me now –
                        but even now He will be a mighty help, and it is in His power to make our
                        life bearable, to keep us from evil, to let all things work together for
                        good, to make the end of us peace.</stress> There is evil in the world and
                    in ourselves, terrible things, and one doesn’t have to have gone far in life to
                    dread much and to feel the need for unfaltering hope in a life after this one,
                    and to know that without faith in a God one cannot live – cannot endure. But
                    with that faith one can long endure. And now, there are words in our Bible that
                    are emphatically repeated in various places, on various occasions, under various
                    circumstances, Fear not, our Father took that to heart and he says ‘I never
                    despair’, let us repeat it after him. Isn’t it your experience, too, that
                    whenever you wanted to do something bad, you were held back – that whenever
                    there was something upsetting you and you saw no way out, you came through it
                    all unharmed? A book by Bunyan tells of a traveller who sees a lion lying at the
                    side of the road he must traverse – and yet he continues on his way – there is
                    nothing else he may or can do – and when he arrives at the place he notices that
                    the lion is chained up and is only there to test the travellers’ courage. Thus
                    it is in life more than once. There is much in store for us, but others have
                    lived, and so whosoever loves his parents must follow them on life’s path. If
                    you value the love and esteem of young people, declare your beliefs openly
                    whenever suitable, and admit that you love Christ and the Bible, doesn’t a son
                    love his Father better for this reason than for any other? Women and children
                    and the simple often feel and know these things so deeply, and there is hidden
                    in so many a heart a great and vigorous faith. We, too, are in need of this when
                    we think of much that is in store for us, He spoke from all His experience of
                    life, and we know how much must have been going on in the heart whose plenitude
                    made His mouth utter the words ‘in the Heavenly Kingdom they do not marry, and
                    are not given in marriage’, and who said, he who hate not, even his own life
                    also, he cannot be My disciple. Yes, those words of the Lord, surely they are
                    the words issuing from the mouth of God whereby man shall live – and not by
                    bread alone and the more one seeks in those words, the more one shall find
                    therein. When I was standing next to Aertsen’s body, the calm and seriousness
                    and solemn stillness of death contrasted so greatly with us who were living,
                    that everyone felt what his daughter said in her simplicity: he is delivered
                    from the burden of life which we must still bear. And yet we are so attached to
                    that old life because there is cheerfulness to counter despondency, and our
                    heart and our soul are gladdened, just as the lark who cannot help singing in
                    the morning, even if our soul is sometimes cast down within us and is disquieted
                    in us. And the memory of everything we have loved remains and returns in the
                    evening of our life. It is not dead, but sleepeth and it is good to collect a
                    great store of it. Accept a handshake in thought, and I wish you the very best,
                    and write again soon to</p>

                <location>Amsterdam</location>, Thursday, <date>31 May 1877</date>.</head>
            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p> It’s already late and everyone is already asleep, but I feel the need to write a
                    few words to you again. You must persevere – you must go onward – as I must, too
                    – we’re going through the same ordeal in many respects. </p>
                <p> In your last letter you write that you were thinking about moving elsewhere if
                    possible, and you mention London and Paris. </p>
                <p> That might be good – oh, old boy, <good_health>how deeply I love those cities,
                        that’s to say I love much of what one meets with there,</good_health>
                    <bad_health>there’s also much that I hate</bad_health> – or at least don’t love
                    as much as the hedges of thornbush and the green grass and the little grey
                    churches. What you’re thinking of is not bad at all. </p>
                <p> Be aware, though – we must both make sure that we survive the time between now
                    and the age of 30 or so – and we must beware of sin – after all, we’re in the
                    midst of life – well then, we must fight a good fight – and we must become men –
                    which we aren’t yet, neither of us – there is something greater in store for us,
                    my conscience tells me so, we are not what others are – well then, but we can
                    endeavour to become so. You know what I want. <stress reason="career">If I may
                        become a clergyman, if I fulfil that position so that my work is equal to
                        that of our Father, then I shall thank God. </stress>
                    <good_health>I have good hope that I shall succeed</good_health>, it was once
                    said to me by someone who was further on in life than I, and who was no stranger
                    in Jerusalem – I mean someone who had sought it himself and had also found it;
                    it was once said to me: I believe that you are a Christian, you see, it was so
                    good for me to hear those words. You too hold fast, no matter what you wish for
                    yourself, to the thought of Christ and keep His saying, as you do. It is good to
                    believe that there is a God who knows what we need, better than we know it
                    ourselves, and who helps us when we need help. It is also good to believe that,
                    just as in the olden days, now, too, an angel is not far from those who feel
                    godly sorrow – not only from those who are almost angels themselves, but
                    especially those who need help from a higher power to keep them from evil, from
                    the evil that we know is in the world and not far from us, not far from those
                    who have a broken heart and a contrite spirit. <bad_health>I’ve carefully read
                        the story of Elijah so often, and so often has it given me strength up to
                        now:</bad_health>And when he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and
                    came to Beersheba, which belongeth to Judah, and left his servant there. But he
                    himself went a day’s journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a
                    juniper tree: and he requested for himself that he might die; and said, It is
                    enough; now, O Lord, take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers. And
                    as he lay and slept under a juniper tree, behold, then an Angel touched him, and
                    said unto him, Arise and eat. And he looked, and, behold, there was a cake baken
                    on the coals, and a cruse of water at his head. And he did eat and drink, and
                    laid him down again. And the Angel of the Lord came again the second time, and
                    touched him, and said, Arise and eat; because the journey is too great for thee.
                    And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that meat forty
                    days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of God. And he came thither unto a
                    cave, and lodged there; and, behold, the word of the Lord came to him, and he
                    said unto him, What doest thou here, Elijah? And he said, I have been very
                    jealous for the Lord God of hosts: for the children of Israel have forsaken Thy
                    covenant, thrown down Thine altars, and slain Thy prophets with the sword; and
                    I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away. And He said, Go
                    forth, and stand upon the mount before the Lord. And, behold, the Lord passed
                    by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the
                    rocks before the Lord; but the Lord was not in the wind: and after the wind an
                    earthquake; but the Lord was not in the earthquake: and after the earthquake a
                    fire; but the Lord was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice.
                    And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and
                    went out, and stood in the entering in of the cave. And, behold, there came a
                    voice unto him, and said, What doest thou here, Elijah? And he said, I have been
                    very jealous for the Lord God of hosts. And the Lord said unto him, ‘Go, return
                    on thy way’.And that story does not stand alone, we read of the Angel who
                    strengthened Him in Gethsemane, who was sorrowful, even unto death, of the Angel
                    who woke Peter from his sleep in prison, of the Angel who appeared to Paul in
                    the night and said ‘Fear not’. And we, although we saw no Angel, although we are
                    not the same as those men of old, should we not know that there is strengthening
                    from Above? </p>
                <p> This afternoon it was stormy and rained here, and I walked to the sea past the
                    Jewish cemetery, a few days ago I also went for a walk there on Buitenkant near
                    the Oosterspoor, where they’re working on the sand works. What a beautiful and
                    heartening story that is too, the one about Jesus walking on the sea, Matthew
                    XIV:2233, And straightway Jesus constrained His disciples to get into a ship,
                    and to go before Him unto the other side, while He sent the multitudes away. And
                    when He had sent the multitudes away, He went up into a mountain apart to pray:
                    and when the evening was come, He was there alone. But the ship was now in the
                    midst of the sea, tossed with waves: for the wind was contrary. And in the
                    fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them, walking on the sea. And when the
                    disciples saw Him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a
                    spirit; and they cried out for fear. But straightway Jesus spake unto them,
                    saying, Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid. And Peter answered Him and
                    said, Lord, if it be Thou, bid me come unto Thee on the water. And He said,
                    Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to
                    go to Jesus. But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning
                    to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me. And immediately Jesus stretched forth
                    his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore
                    didst thou doubt? And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased.
                    Believe in God, through faith one can become ‘sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing’
                    and evergreen and we need not complain ‘if our youth disappears at the maturing
                    of our powers’. </p>

                    my regards to your housemates and any acquaintances you might see, and accept in

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p> Well, what do you say about Anna? <unstress reason="family">It surprised me, and
                        it seems to be serious too, and will certainly take place, one would venture
                        to say. It could be good.</unstress> The difficulties of holding a
                    subordinate position, especially when one perseveres in it for a longer period,
                    as she has in fact done for years in all honour and virtue, are very great and
                    sometimes become a hard struggle, and the seemingly easy becomes extremely
                    difficult. </p>
                <p>There’s nevertheless much poetry in it, and such years are a treasure not easily
                    lost, and when one denies and humbles oneself, especially the first time, one
                    has a wonderful feeling of inner peace, <bad_health>but I would understand very
                        well if the future was sometimes dark for her too</bad_health> – it might be
                    sensible of her, for her part, to have already decided to take this step. And I
                    also maintain that she truly loves him, I believe that and trust in it
                    absolutely, otherwise things wouldn’t have gone this far. And so I sincerely
                    hope that she won’t be disappointed but that this, with God’s guidance, will be
                    the path to her lasting happiness. May the Lord grant that she find peace, that
                    dear sister, and bless her, and give her good things in life. On this occasion I
                    congratulate you, too, as I have Anna and Pa and Ma. </p>
                <p>How are you, old chap? I had wanted to write to you earlier and answer your last
                    letter. I have a lot to do and the work isn’t easy.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="environment">Then again, I go to church a lot, there are
                        beautiful old churches here, and outstanding preachers, I often hear Uncle
                        Stricker, and what he says is very good, and he speaks with much warmth and
                        feeling. </unstress>I’ve heard the Rev. Laurillard three times, you would
                    like him too, because he paints, as it were, and his work is at once lofty and
                    noble art. He has the feeling of an artist in the true sense of the word, as
                    someone like Andersen had when he says, for example:</p>
                <p>Every evening came the moon and whispered in my ear, Telling of the quiet night
                    and what its eye Had lit on from its watchpost in the sky. It who knows
                    centuries – through ages did it roam, Casting, high above the Flood and crest of
                    foam, On the floating ark a soft silver glow, Just as it now lights my lonely
                    window Then, too, when the folk of Israel knelt down To weep by the waters of
                    Babylon It illumined with sad twinkling down below The unstrung harp, hanging on
                    the willow.</p>
                <p> The moon still shines now, and the sun and the evening star, which is fortunate,
                    and they often speak of God’s Love and call to mind the words, lo, I am with you
                    alway, even unto the end of the world. </p>
                <p>
                    <work origin="new" stage="middle">Am busy making a summary of the history of the
                        Reformation</work>, there’s much that is stimulating and appealing in the
                    history of those days. </p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="environment">The room in the Trippenhuis where Rembrandt’s

                    that portrait by Van der Helst. </p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p> I feel the need to write to you again, let me have a word from you too, if you
                    have time. </p>
                <p> This morning I went to the early sermon, and the text was Eph. 5:14, Awake thou
                    that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.
                        <unstress reason="environment">When I left here it was raining, and also
                        when leaving the church, though during the sermon the sun had been shining
                        brightly through the windows.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p> Pa had to lead the early service today in Etten, and afterwards Pa had to go to
                    Zundert. </p>
                <p> After that I heard dear Uncle Stricker in the Oudezijdskapel on the words
                    ‘Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees’, which is a warning
                    not to become too attached to outward forms and ceremonies without truly sincere
                    religious feeling of the heart, as opposed to a life without belief in the
                    things that are higher than those in this life. There were very few people in
                    the church, apart from the orphan boys and orphan girls with their red and black
                    clothes, who filled a large part of the little old church nonetheless. If you
                    come here again I hope to take you there, that Oudezijdskapel is in a very
                    narrow street, Zeedijk, near the part of Buitenkant called ‘the old taryards’
                    and near Warmoesstraat. It’s a very nice part of town and reminds one of the
                    heart of London, like Booksellers’ Row or some such place. May it be granted me
                    in time to speak as I have heard so many do, and hear each Sunday again. I’m
                    doing my best to become skilled at it with all the power in me. </p>
                <p> Last week I spent an evening at the old Rev. Meijjes’s and met his son there,
                    the Rev. Jeremie Meijjes with his wife, a daughter of Professor Tilanus, and two
                    of his sons – one of them attends the gymnasium here and the other is training
                    to be an engineer. The latter helped to build those roofs here at the dockyard
                    (underneath which the ships are built, where we went with Uncle that afternoon
                    you were here), as well as the new Kattenburg bridge. It was a pleasant evening
                    and we talked about all kinds of foreign matters. He’s a very gifted man and has
                    a pure talent and a great faith, heard him in the Westerkerk. Saw him coming
                    from the pulpit and walking through the church after the sermon, and that tall,
                    noble figure and that tired, pale face and that noble head, the hair already
                    showing some grey, made a great impression on me. To be tired in such a way from
                    that work, that is a blessing. </p>
                <p> Today you’ll perhaps go to Scheveningen, have a good Sunday, how I’d like to
                    visit your little room. Heard from home that you’ll probably go to see Mauve
                    again soon in his house in the dunes, and will stay overnight, I can imagine you
                    sitting there, and I also know what you’ll discuss. Last week Mendes told me
                    about a very interesting part of the city, namely the area extending from the
                    Leidsepoort (thus close to Vondelpark) to the Hollandsche Spoor station. Went
                    there yesterday, I knew part of it already, and you do too, I think, namely the
                    part near the station. There are a great many mills, sawmills, workers’ houses
                    with little gardens, old houses too, of all kinds, and very populous, and the
                    area is crisscrossed by all kinds of small canals and waterways full of barges,
                    and all kinds of picturesque bridges and so on. It must certainly be a wonderful
                    thing to be a minister in such a district. </p>
                <p> This study is difficult, old chap, but I must persevere, and to that end may He
                    help me of Whom it is written: If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God,
                    that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not. </p>
                <p> Ma wrote in her last letter something about ‘Anna’s house’, which is a new
                    expression that doesn’t sound bad, she’ll perhaps be very happy one of these
                    days, may she have made a good choice and one not to be repented of. The best we
                    can do for the time being is, I think, simply be very happy about it. </p>
                <p> If you should happen to visit Mauve and Jet one of these days, give them my warm
                    regards and spend some pleasant hours together, and bid goodday to the dunes and
                    the sea for me. And tell Mauve that the photograph of his drawing, the plough in
                    the field, is hanging in my little room and constantly reminds me of him. </p>
                <p> Are you reading something beautiful? I’d like so much to start reading a great
                    many books but may not, if you can get hold of John Halifax do read it again,
                    even though we read it with nostalgia, still, let us not say ‘that is not for
                    me’, because it’s good to go on believing in everything that’s good and noble. I
                    heard that the man whose life and character prompted the book to be written died
                    recently, he was called Harper and ran a large bookshop in London. I once met
                    the painter Millais on the street in London, <good_health>just after I had been
                        so happy to see various of his paintings,</good_health> and that noble
                    figure made me think of John Halifax. Millais once painted The lost penny, a
                    young woman looking in the early morning twilight for the penny she has lost
                    (there’s an engraving of it, the lost mite) and not the least beautiful of his
                    work is an autumn landscape, Chill October. </p>
                <p>Adieu, old chap, accept in thought a hearty handshake, and believe me, after
                    giving my regards to your housemates, in haste, because I have to go to church,

            <body>
                <p> Thanks for your last letter, I heard from home that you’ve already been to
                    Mauve’s, that was undoubtedly a good day, I’ll certainly hear about it sometime,
                    when the opportunity arises. Herewith a contribution for your collection, namely
                    three lithographs after Bosboom and two by J. Weissenbruch, found them this
                    morning at a Jewish bookseller’s. Is that one after Bosboom the church in
                    Scheveningen? The other is the Grote Kerk in Breda, the third after his painting
                    that was at the large exhibition in Paris. <good_health>Those two after
                        Weissenbruch moved me</good_health> – perhaps you already have them, but
                    then again possibly not. Do go on collecting such prints, and books too. </p>
                <p> I’m now collecting Latin and Greek themes and all kinds of writings on history
                    and so on. <work origin="new" stage="middle">Am working on one on the

                    <stress reason="career">Recently spoke to a young man who had just done his
                        entrance examination for the Leiden college with a good result – it isn’t
                        easy, he told me what they asked him, but I do keep up my courage, and with
                        God’s help I’ll pass them,</stress> and the following examinations as well.
                    Mendes has given me every reason to believe that at the end of three months
                    we’ll be as far as he imagined we would be if everything went well. Still, Greek
                    lessons in the heart of Amsterdam, in the heart of the Jewish quarter on a very
                    warm and oppressive summer afternoon, with the feeling hanging over me that many
                    difficult examinations will have to be taken, set by very learned and cunning
                    professors, are rather more oppressive than a walk on the beach or in the
                    Brabant wheatfields, which will certainly be beautiful now, on a day like that.
                    But we must ‘strive on’ through everything, as Uncle Jan says. </p>
                <p> A couple of days ago a couple of children fell into the water near the
                    Kattenburg bridge. Uncle saw it and commandeered the sloop of the Makasser that
                    is in dock here. A little boy was pulled out; I went along with two ship’s
                    doctors whom Uncle had sent over, and the men carrying the boy into a chemist’s
                    shop made every effort to resuscitate the child, but to no avail. In the
                    meantime it was recognized by the father, who’s a stoker at the dockyard, and
                    the little body was taken home in a woollen blanket. The search went on for an
                    hour and a half, as it was thought that a girl had fallen in as well, though
                    happily that seems not to be the case. In the evening I went back to see the
                    people, it was then already dark in the house, the little body lay so still on a
                    bed in a side room, he was such a sweet little boy. <bad_health>There was great
                        sorrow, that child was the light of that house, as it were, and that light
                        had now been put out. Even though coarse people express their grief in a
                        coarse way and without dignity, as the mother did, among others, still, one
                        feels a great deal in such a house of mourning, and the impression stayed
                        with me the whole evening when I took a walk.</bad_health>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="environment">Last Sunday morning I made a nice excursion,
                        namely first to the early sermon, the Rev. Posthumus Meijjes in the
                        Noorderkerk, then to Bickerseiland, where I walked on the dyke along the IJ
                        until it was time for church again, and then to the Eilandskerk where Uncle
                        Stricker preached.</unstress> Thus the time passes, and quickly too, already
                    we’re almost at the end of the week again.How are you, old chap? So very often,
                    daily, do I think of you. </p>
                <p> God help us, struggling, to stay on top, it is good that you associate with good
                    artists; I, too, still cling to the memory of many of them. Overcome evil with
                    good, it is written, and one can seek to do it – and to this end God can help
                    and make our days bearable with much good in the meantime, and preserve us from
                    too much selfreproach. </p>
                <p> When Uncle Jan commandeered the sloop and the doctors to go and help on the
                    afternoon that accident happened, I saw him in his element. </p>
                <p> Now I must get to work, though I still have to fill this page. Anna is in
                    Leiden, as you surely know, and will come here one of these days with our future
                    brotherinlaw, am looking forward to seeing them very much, Pa wrote so
                    cheerfully about last Sunday when they were in Etten and everything was good in
                    his eyes, and they see rightly, <good_health>so let us view what has happened to
                        our sister as a blessing on our house, in which we all share; if one member
                        be glad, let all the members be glad with her.</good_health>
                </p>
                <p> Next week, or perhaps even tomorrow, Uncle and Aunt Pompe are coming to stay
                    here, and also Fanny and Bet ’s Graeuwen, it’s been a long time since I’ve seen
                    any of them. </p>
                <p> Am quite often up rather early in the morning, and when the sun rises over the
                    yard and the workers come a while later it’s a wonderful sight from the window,
                    and I should wish to have you here. <work origin="new" stage="planned">Will I
                        later be working on such a morning on a sermon on ‘He maketh His sun to rise
                        on the evil and on the good’, or on ‘Awake thou that sleepest, and arise
                        from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light’, or on ‘It is a good thing
                        to praise the Lord in the morning’ and ‘It is a pleasant thing for the eyes
                        to behold the sun’</work> – I hope so. </p>
                <p> All the same, <unstress reason="environment">it seems that the sun never shines
                        so beautifully as it does in a parsonage or in a church. It’s wonderful to
                        work on ‘the writings’ early in the morning.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>If you have the time and a stamp and paper, then write again soon. Uncle Jan
                    sends you his regards, that evening you described there in the dunes must have
                    been pleasant. <unstress reason="environment">In Uncle Cor’s shop I recently saw
                        The Gospels by Bida, how beautiful it is, </unstress>how wonderful it must
                    be to be a Christian labourer like that, but it’s impossible to put into words
                    how beautiful it is, that’s it again, there is much in that work that reminds
                    one of Rembrandt. And now a handshake in thought, and I sincerely wish you the
                    best, and believe me ever</p>

                <location>Amsterdam</location>, Friday, <date>3 August 1877</date>.</head>
            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p> Thanks for your last letter, which I was happy to receive and for which I
                    heartily thank you. What you write about Mr Tersteeg’s loss, that his youngest
                    child has died, moved me, and I felt the need to start corresponding with him
                    again. </p>
                <p> Yesterday a letter from Anna, who arrives today at 12:45 with Van Houten, am
                    very much looking forward to meeting them, he seems to have made a good
                    impression on you, as he did on everyone at home, we must simply consider it an
                    asset. </p>
                <p> So you were at Mauve’s and had a good time there, did you draw anything while
                    you were there? I was also in Weissenbruch’s studio once, a couple of days
                    before my first trip to London, and the recollection of what I saw there in the
                    way of studies and paintings is still very clear, as is that of the man himself.
                    When next you write, tell me something about the exhibition that will have
                    opened yesterday, how much the artists would be able to find here at the
                    dockyard that’s fit to be painted. The Rev. Meijjes was here a few days ago with
                    2 of his sons, and Uncle gave us permission to go and see the yard and the
                    workshops, the forges and so on were of course in use, everything was standing
                    still that Sunday we were there together. Was also with Uncle Pompe and Jan on
                    the guardship the Wassenaar, which is also very interesting. This week the house
                    here was full of people, Uncle and Aunt Pompe and Jan, Uncle Cor and Vincent,
                    Fanny and Bet ’s Graeuwen and Bertha van Gogh from Haarlem, the last is a very
                    sweet girl. </p>
                <p> Went last Sunday to the early sermon given by the Rev. Hasebroek, and again in
                    the morning to that Oudezijdskapel I already told you about. The Rev. Van Marken
                    preached very beautifully on Matth. IX:9. Jesus saw a man, named Matthew,
                    sitting at the receipt of custom: and he saith unto him, Follow Me, and in the
                    next part of that chapter: Jesus ate with publicans and sinners. They that be
                    whole need not a physician, but they that are sick. I am not come to call the
                    righteous, but sinners to repentance. </p>
                <p> So day by day I do my best to settle in, especially in Latin and Greek, and have
                    already written quite a few themes, composed of phrases that remind me of the
                    old schooldays, such as ‘Which eminent philosopher was sentenced to death by the
                    Athenians? The very good and wise Socrates. Our life is very similar to a
                    journey, and open to very many and very great catastrophes and accidents. The
                    nature of Odysseus, and the grapes of the vineyard’. I was up early this
                    morning, it had rained a lot during the night, but the sun broke through the
                    clouds very early, the ground and the piles of timber and beams in the yard were
                    drenched, and the sky reflected in the puddles was completely golden due to the
                    rising sun, and at 5 o’clock one saw all those hundreds of workers looking like
                    little black figures fanning out on all sides. <good_health>I go to Uncle
                        Stricker’s study quite a lot. He’s very clever and has lots of beautiful
                        books, and he has a great love for his work and his position.</good_health>
                    Got a very cheerful letter last Monday from Pa in Helvoirt. </p>
                <p>I heard from home that you got a bill from Dr Coster for 40 guilders, that’s
                    rather a burden, and paying it will remind you of the feeling one has when a
                    tooth is pulled, if only I could help you, but you know that I have neither gold
                    nor silver. I often have to use my cunning to get money for the collection at
                    church, for example by exchanging stamps for cents at a tobacconist’s, but old
                    boy, struggling we stay on top, and you know that it is said of the poor in the
                    kingdom of heaven that they are blessed. <good_health>Every time I see Uncle
                        Vincent I’m moved by something indescribably kind and, I might say,
                        something good and spirited in him, I don’t know what it is</good_health>,
                    Pa has much more of it still, and Uncle Jan has it in another form, and it’s in
                    Uncle Cor as well, among a hundred people one wouldn’t always find even one who
                    calls them to mind, do let us preserve their image and their memory. Could it be
                    that which Fénelon describes as follows in his Télémaque?The man to whom he had
                    by chance presented himself was a stranger, who had an air of majesty, and yet
                    something that was sad and downcast; at times he appeared dreamy, at others he
                    had something that was either very determined or excited and agitated. At first
                    he hardly listened to Telemachus’s question, but at last he replied: You are not
                    mistaken, Ulysses was received at the home of King Alcinous, as in a place where
                    God is feared and hospitality is practised, but he is no longer there, and you
                    would search for him in vain; he has departed for Ithaca, if indeed the angry
                    Gods eventually permit him to see his household deities again. Telemachus looked
                    at him intently; the longer he looked, the more moved and astonished he was.
                    This stranger, he said to Mentor, answered me like a man who scarcely listens to
                    what is said to him, and who is full of bitterness. I pity the unfortunate since
                    I have become one of them, and I feel that my heart is drawn toward this man,
                    without knowing why. He did not receive me well; he hardly deigned to listen to
                    me, or to reply. And so Mentor said to him, I am not at all astonished, my dear
                    Telemachus, to see you thus moved; the cause of your pain, who is a stranger to
                    you, is not so to Mentor, it is nature that speaks and makes itself felt, it is
                    nature that softens your heart. The stranger who caused you such strong emotion
                    is the great Ulysses. He is sailing straight to Ithaca, he is already very close
                    to port, and at last he sees again those places so long yearned for. Your eyes
                    saw him, but without knowing him; soon you will see him and you will know him —
                    and he will know you, but now the Gods could not allow you to acknowledge each
                    other, away from Ithaca. His heart was no less moved than yours; he is too wise
                    to reveal himself to any mortal, in a place where he could be exposed to
                    treachery. Ulysses, your father, is the wisest of all men; his heart is like a
                    deep well, its secret could not be drawn from it. He loves truth, and never says
                    aught that might wound it, but he speaks it only out of necessity, and wisdom,
                    like a seal, ever keeps his lips closed to needless words. How moved he was when
                    speaking to you! What violence did he do himself, so as in no wise to disclose
                    himself! What did he not suffer, seeing you? That is what made him sad and
                    downcast.And now, old chap, a hearty handshake in thought, let us but keep our
                    faith in God and continue to worship what we know, give my regards to those at
                    Mauve’s and anyone else you might see, especially your housemates, I wish you
                    the very best, I sincerely hope you find a way of paying that bill, adieu and
                    believe me</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>
                    <good_health>It felt wonderful to hear Gladwell’s voice in the hall as I sat
                        upstairs studying and to see him a moment later and to shake his
                        hand</good_health>.<unstress reason="environment"> Yesterday we took a nice
                        walk through the main streets and past most of the churches</unstress>, and
                    got up this morning before 5 to see the people coming to the dockyard and
                    afterwards walked to Zeeburg and also saw a cemetery and went to the Trippenhuis
                    (twice) and he alone to Van der Hoop, and he was also at Uncle Cor’s gallery
                    (who isn’t in town, however) and with Mendes in the room. Now we also have plans
                    to go to Uncle Stricker’s (because I’ve been invited to eat there today and will
                    simply risk it and take him along), and if we have time also to see Vos and Kee.
                    And I would also like very much to go with him to Bickerseiland, but perhaps
                    there won’t be time. Have also strongly suggested that he go to Haarlem to see
                    the paintings by Frans Hals, and now he’s going there and not to Antwerp as he
                    had planned, but will save Belgium for later and is concentrating now
                    exclusively on Holland. </p>
                <p> We also spent a lot of time in the little study and talked of things new and
                    old. </p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="friendship">When he’s sitting beside me I again feel the same
                        feeling that drew me to him so often, as though he were a son of the same
                        family and a brother in faith because he loves ‘the man of sorrows and
                        acquainted with grief’.</unstress> Who is our God and in Whose teachings and
                    resurrection we believe, Whose spirit we seek, of Whose love we ask that it
                    constrain us in life and that nothing separate us from it, nor things present,
                    nor things to come. In him, too, godly sorrow shall work that which in many it
                    has worked and works and shall work, a choice not to be repented of, for that
                    good part which shall not be taken away, and choosing the only thing necessary
                    and worthy of bringing forth fruits meet for repentance. He is a Christian and
                    will become one more and more. <unstress reason="friendship">This morning we
                        read together the story of Elijah by the brook Cherith</unstress> and at the
                    widow’s – because when we lived together in Montmartre we found that the barrel
                    of meal did not waste and the cruse of water did not fail – and yesterday
                    evening the parable of the sower and others. Now he’ll stay with you for a while
                    as well, and is longing to see your little room and what you have in the way of
                    prints. </p>
                <p> Received from him Bunyan, The pilgrim’s progress, that is an asset, as is
                    Bossuet, Oraison funèbres, which I recently bought very cheaply, and The
                    imitation by T. a Kempis in Latin, which I got from Vos and which I hope to be
                    able to read in Latin some day.He read here various bits of Bungener, Esquiros,
                    Lamennais, Souvestre, Lamartine (Cromwell), and took pleasure in the lithographs
                    after Bosboom, we bought one from a Jew, and he gave me instructions to buy some
                    more for him when the opportunity presents itself. </p>
                <p> I sincerely hope that you’ll have a pleasant evening with him, and I believe
                    that the more you seek in him the more you will find in him. </p>
                <p> We talked about this and that, and what we said to each other is this: many,
                    having come to a point in life where one must make a choice about life, have
                    chosen for their part ‘the love of Christ and poverty’, or rather ‘give me
                    neither poverty nor riches, feed me with bread convenient for me’. <unstress
                        reason="friendship">The time together flew past for me, and I wished we
                        could have stayed together a little longer; </unstress>but it cannot be, and
                    everyone must return to his way and continue to do whatsoever the hand findeth
                    to do in the calling wherein he was called, and <good_health>I for my part am
                        thankful from the bottom of my heart that I was able to see him
                        again</good_health>, and found in him that which drew me to him. He told me
                    that you will certainly make the trip with the nouveautés, probably in about 4
                    weeks’ time, so I also hope to see you again then. </p>
                <p> I sincerely hope that he’ll have pleasant and good memories of his visit to
                    Holland, it’s courageous of him to have persisted with that plan. </p>
                <p>Give my regards to your housemates, have a good evening with him; should wish for
                    you to be attached to him as I feel attached to him at the moment, and accept in

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p> The time is approaching when you’ll go travelling for the Messrs Cie, and I’m
                    already looking forward to seeing and talking to you again. </p>
                <p> What I wanted to ask you is this. Wouldn’t you be able to arrange it so that we
                    could be together for a while, quietly and calmly, I was thinking of at least
                    one whole day. Mendes was out of town this week, staying for a few days with a
                    Rev. Schröder in Zwolle who had lessons from him at one time. Being less
                    occupied because of this, <good_health>I could carry out my plan to see the
                        etchings by Rembrandt in the Trippenhuis, went there this morning and am
                        glad I did it.</good_health>
                </p>
                <p> When I was there I thought, won’t Theo and I be able to see them together
                    sometime? Think about whether you couldn’t go off on your own for a day or even
                    longer for such things. </p>
                <p> How much someone like Pa – who ofttimes travels at night, carrying a lantern, to
                    a sick or dying person, for example, to speak to him about Him whose word is
                    also a light in the night of suffering and mortal fear – would have a feeling
                    for Rembrandt’s etchings. Such as the flight into Egypt at night or the
                    entombment of Jesus. That collection in the Trippenhuis is splendid, and I saw
                    much that I’d never encountered before, there they also told me about drawings
                    by R. in the Fodor. If you think it’s a good idea, speak to Mr Tersteeg about
                    it, and write a few words in advance and tell me when you’re coming, then I’ll
                    study ahead to be free and at your disposal when you come. </p>
                <p> I can’t see anything of that kind, paintings either, for example, without
                    thinking of you and of Pa and everyone at home. </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="career">Am otherwise up to my ears in work</stress>, because
                    it’s becoming clear to me what I actually have to know, what they know and what
                    inspires those whom I should like to follow. ‘Search the scriptures’ is not
                    written for nothing, but those words are a good guide, and I’d really like to
                    become such a scribe who is like unto a man that is an householder, which
                    bringeth forth out of his treasure things old and new. </p>
                <p> I spent Monday evening with Vos and Kee, they’re fond of each other and one
                    certainly notices that where Love lives the Lord commands His blessing. It’s
                    nice at their house, only a great pity that he couldn’t go on being a minister.
                    When one sees them sitting there together in the evening by the kindly light of
                    their lamp in the little living room and close by the bedroom of their little
                    boy, who wakes from time to time and asks his mother for this or that, it’s an
                    idyll, but they also know dreadful days and sleepless nights, and fear and
                    anxiety. Walked back over the big sand works by the Oosterspoor which you know,
                    and along Buitenkant, the moon was shining and everything was full of M. Maris
                    or Andersen. </p>
                <p> From there it’s such a wonderful sight across the city and towers, with lights
                    here and there, on one side the IJ and on the other Bickerseiland. And
                    everything was so deathly still, ‘the withered leaf does not rustle, the stars
                    alone speak. When all sounds cease, God’s voice is heard under the stars’. </p>
                <p> Was in the Oudezijdskapel last Sunday, where the Rev. Jer. Meijjes preached on
                    Eccl. XI:7XII:7.‘Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the
                    eyes to behold the sun: but if a man live many years, and rejoice in them all;
                    yet let him remember the days of darkness; for they shall be many. All that
                    cometh is vanity. Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer
                    thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the
                    sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all these things God will bring
                    thee into judgement. Therefore remove heaviness from thy heart, and put away
                    evil from thy flesh: for childhood and youth are vanity. Remember now thy
                    Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days come not, nor the years
                    draw nigh, nor the stars be darkened, nor the clouds return after the rain. </p>
                <p> In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall
                    bow themselves, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those that look
                    out of the windows be darkened, and the door shall be shut in the streets, when
                    the sound of the grinding is low, and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird,
                    and all the daughters of musick shall be brought low; also when they shall be
                    afraid of that which is high, and fears shall be in the way, and the almond tree
                    shall flourish, and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail:
                    because man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about the streets: or
                    ever the silver bowl be loosed, or the wheel broken at the cistern. Then shall
                    the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall turn unto God Who
                    gave it.’ For whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap and he that
                    soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap Life Everlasting.I then heard the
                    Rev. Laurillard again in the early sermon on Jer. VIII:7, Yea, the stork in the
                    heaven knoweth her appointed times; and the turtle and the crane and the swallow
                    observe the time of their coming. </p>
                <p> He told about how he had walked on a road where the leaves were already falling
                    from the trees, and had seen a flock of migratory birds and spoke about the
                    phenomenon of birds migrating, and how man will also migrate once to a warmer
                    land. He treated this subject in the spirit of Michelet or Rückert, or as many
                    have also painted it, including Protais, Souvenirs of the homeland. </p>
                <p> Pa wrote that you’d been to Antwerp, am eager to hear what you saw there, long
                    ago I also saw the old paintings in the museum – and even seem to recall a
                    beautiful portrait by Rembrandt, it would be wonderful if one could remember
                    everything clearly, but it’s just like the sight of a long road, in the distance
                    things seem smaller and as though in a mist. </p>
                <p> There was a fire here one evening on the water, namely a barge with arrack or
                    something similar. Was with Uncle on the Wassenaar, there was no real danger as
                    they’d managed to get the burning barge out from between the other boats and had
                    tied it to a post. When the flames got up a bit one saw Buitenkant and the black
                    row of people standing there watching, and the little boats going back and forth
                    around the blaze also appeared black in the water in which the flames were
                    reflected, I don’t know if you’re familiar with photographs after Jazet that
                    were in the Galerie photographique at one time but have now been destroyed,
                    ‘Christmas Eve’, ‘The conflagration’ and others, it was something like that. </p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="environment">Twilight is already falling, ‘blessed twilight’
                        Dickens called it, and indeed he was right.</unstress> Blessed twilight
                    especially when two or three are gathered together in harmony of mind, and like
                    the scribes bring forth out of their treasure old and new things just like a
                    householder. Blessed twilight when two or three are gathered together in His
                    name and He himself is in the midst of them. And blessed is he who knows these
                    things and also does them. Rembrandt knew that, for out of the rich treasure of
                    his heart he brought forth, among other things, that drawing in sepia, charcoal,
                    ink. (which is in the British Museum) depicting the house in Bethany. In that
                    room twilight dominates, the figure of the Lord, noble and impressive, stands
                    out gravely against the window through which the evening twilight falls. Just
                    like the figure of John Halifax. He said he was a Christian, in front of a
                    window with white curtains in a room in Rose Cottage, I think, on an evening
                    like so many that are described with so much feeling in that book. At Jesus’
                    feet sits Mary, who had chosen that good part which would not be taken away from
                    her, and Martha is in the room busy with something or other, stirring up the
                    fire or something like that, if I remember rightly. I hope not to forget that
                    drawing, nor what it seemed to be saying to me: I am the light of the world: he
                    that followeth Me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life,
                    the light of the gospel that is preached to the poor in My Father’s Kingdom,
                    that shines, like a candle placed on a candlestick, on all that are in the
                    house. I am come that they shall have life and that they shall have abundance. I
                    am the Resurrection, and the Life: he that believeth in Me, though he were dead,
                    yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and believeth in Me shall never die. If
                    a man love Me, My Father will honour him and We will come unto him, and make our
                    abode with him, We will come in to him, and will sup with him. The twilight says
                    such things to those who have ears with which to hear and a heart with which to
                    understand and to have faith in God – blessed twilight. </p>
                <p> And it’s also twilight in that painting by Ruipérez, The imitation of Jesus
                    Christ, and also in another etching by Rembrandt, ‘David praying to God’, yes!
                    we may thank ‘blessed twilight’ for the words ‘as the hart panteth after the
                    water brooks, so panteth my soul after Thee, O God. My soul thirsteth for God,
                    for the living God. </p>
                <p> Deep calleth unto deep: all Thy waves and Thy billows are gone over me. Yet the
                    Lord will command His lovingkindness in the daytime, and in the night his song
                    shall be with me, and my prayer unto the God of my life. Why art thou cast down,
                    O my soul? And why art thou disquieted within me? Hope thou in God; for I shall
                    yet praise Him, Who is the health of my countenance, and my God’. </p>
                <p> But it isn’t always ‘blessed twilight’, as you see from my handwriting I’m by
                    the lamp upstairs, because there are people downstairs and I can’t sit with them
                    with my books. </p>
                <p> Uncle Jan sends you his regards, Hendrik and Marie were here for a day this past
                    week and have now left. Monday a telegram that the Madura had arrived at
                    Southampton. The day of their departure Uncle left in the morning with the 6
                    o’clock train with Mr Vos, who had come here the previous evening from Utrecht –
                    for Nieuwediep to say goodbye to them on board. </p>
                <p> I wish you well, write soon and do come soon, because it’s good to see each
                    other again and to talk, perhaps we could go together to see the exhibition that
                    will open one of these days. Give my regards, too, to your housemates. Old boy,
                    how wonderful it must be to have a life behind one like Pa has, God grant that
                    we be and that we may become more and more sons after His spirit and heart,
                    something may yet come of that, He can raise a person above that which is his
                    nature, His strength can be made perfect in our weakness. </p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Thanks for your last letter, which I was glad to get. Yes, old boy, that etching
                    after Jules Goupil is beautiful and forms, with all that’s associated with it, a
                    fine and good whole that is a thing to keep in one’s heart. I rather envy your
                    having read Carlyle, ‘French Revolution’, it’s not unknown to me but didn’t read
                    all of it, I found parts of it in another book, namely by Taine. </p>
                <p>
                    <work origin="new" stage="middle">Am busy making an extract from Motley,
                        including capture of Den Briel and siege of Haarlem, Alkmaar and Leiden,

                    studies on what he has done, for that is how I’d like to do it too. That history
                    of the 80 Years’ War is really wonderful, anyone would do well to make such a
                    good fight of his life. <stress reason="career">Truly life is a fight, and one
                        must defend oneself and resist and make plans and calculations with a
                        cheerful and alert mind in order to make it through and get ahead. It
                        becomes no easier the further one gets in life</stress>, and it has been
                    rightly said: </p>
                <p>Does the road go uphill then all the way? ‘Yes to the very end’ And will the
                    journey take all day long? ‘From morn till night, my friend.’</p>
                <p>
                    <good_health>But by fighting the difficulties in which one finds oneself, an
                        inner strength develops from within our heart,</good_health> which improves
                    in life’s fight (one matures in the storm), if we always endeavour to keep that
                    heart out of which are the issues of life, good and simple and rich toward God,
                    to restore that and make it thus more and more, and to bear in mind the words
                    that we must have a good conscience before God and before people. </p>
                <p> As we regard others so are we regarded by many eyes. It is from the conscience —
                    God’s finest gift, and the proof that His eye is upon us, allseeing and
                    allknowing, and also the assurance that He be not far from every one of us, but
                    as our shade upon our right hand, and that He keeps us from the evil — that our
                    light comes in the darkness of life and of the world. And if we feel an eye
                    watching us, as it were, then it is good to gaze upward sometimes as though
                    seeing Him who is invisible.I know that life of Frederick the Great illustrated
                    by Menzel, that’s a good acquisition, do go on with that collection; I also know
                    that woodcut after Jacque, The sheepfold, do bring those things home with you at
                    Christmas. </p>
                <p> Have bought from the Jew that lithograph after L. Steffens of which you once
                    showed me the painting, an old and a young priest conversing in a garden, it’s a
                    good lithograph. The scene reminds me of a painting by Jacquand, photographed in
                    the cartes de visite, it’s called ‘The new vicar’, I believe, it has the same
                    sentiment, and also of The novice by G. Doré. </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="career">Old boy, Latin and Greek and studying are
                        difficult</stress>, but a<good_health>ll the same I feel very happy with it
                        and am doing the things I have longed for.</good_health> I’m no longer
                    allowed to sit up late in the evenings, Uncle has very strictly forbidden it —
                    yet the words written below the etching by Rembrandt stick in my mind, In medio
                    noctis vim suam lux exerit (In the middle of the night the light diffuses its
                    strength) and I make sure that a small gaslight goes on burning the whole night,
                    and lie looking at it often in medio noctis, <good_health>thinking about my plan
                        for work the following day and considering how to go about that studying as
                        well as possible.</good_health> Hope in the winter to light the fire early
                    in the morning (and while obeying Uncle yet letting the light shine in the night
                    and darkness once in a while). The winter mornings have something special about
                    them, Frère painted that in that workman, ‘A cooper’ (the etching is hanging in
                    your room, I believe), among other things. </p>
                <p> Fill my soul with a holy bitterness that shall be agreeable to Thee, and I shall
                    humbly spend all the years of my life in Thy service, in the bitterness of my
                    soul, yea, even in Thy Service, O Man of sorrows and acquainted with grief. That
                    is certainly a good prayer, and I thought of it when I told you in simplicity
                    that it was good to steep oneself in coffee in everyday life. </p>
                <p> A person has needs, and requires strength and fortification to be able to work.
                    And one must make do with what one has and fight with such weapons as are within
                    one’s reach, and use the means at one’s disposal to make the most of it and gain
                    from it. </p>
                <p> (You can see from my handwriting that it had grown dark, but now the lamp is
                    on.) Ate hotchpot at Uncle Stricker’s one afternoon, and it occurred to me on
                    that occasion to make that extract from Motley, I’ll show it to you at
                    Christmas. Because here in town I’ve seen and walked over so awfully many
                    doorsteps and church floors and flights of steps up to houses, it occurred to me
                    to make those maps of rocky Scotland, and while colouring them in (green and
                    red) I thought of those pickles that Uncle is so fond of and I’ve grown fond of
                    too. A person’s soul is a singularly strange thing, and it is good, I think, to
                    have one like a map of England made with love and to have in it as much as
                    possible of that love which is holy and beareth all things and believeth all
                    things and hopeth all things and endureth all things and never
                        faileth.<good_health> That Love is the Light of the world, the true life
                        that is the light of men. The knowledge of languages is certainly a good
                        thing to have, and I follow after in the hope that I might also grasp
                        something of it.</good_health>
                </p>
                <p> When one eats a crust of black rye bread it’s certainly good to think of the
                    words ‘Tunc justi fulgebunt ut sol in regnum Patris sui’ (Then shall the
                    righteous shine forth as the Sun in the Kingdom of their Father), or also when
                    one very often has muddy boots or wet, dirty clothes. May we all at sometime
                    enter into that kingdom which is not of this world, where they do not marry and
                    are not given in marriage, where the sun shall be no more thy light by day,
                    neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee, but the Lord shall
                    be an Everlasting Light, and God our glory, where the sun shall no more go down,
                    neither shall the moon withdraw itself, for the Lord shall be thine Everlasting
                    Light, and the days of mourning shall be ended and God shall wipe away all tears
                    from the eyes. And so we can be leavened with the leaven of ‘sorrowful, yet
                    alway rejoicing’, being what we are through God’s grace, having in the secret
                    recesses of the heart the words ‘I never despair’ because we have faith in God.
                    And then ‘Set your face as a flint’ are really good words in many circumstances,
                    and also ‘be like an iron pillar or like an old oak tree’. It’s also good to
                    love thorns, such as the thornhedges around the little English church or the
                    roses in the cemetery, they’re so beautiful these days, yes, if one could make
                    oneself a crown of the thorns of life, not for the people but with which one is
                    seen by God, then one would do well. </p>
                <p> I imagine you know the woodcuts by Swain, he’s a clever man, his studio is in
                    such a nice part of London, not far from that part of the Strand where the
                    offices of the illustrated magazines are (Ill. Lond. News, The Graphic, Seeley),
                    not far from Booksellers’ Row either, full of all kinds of bookstalls and shops
                    where one sees all kinds of things, from the etchings of Rembrandt to the
                    Household edition of Dickens and Chandos classics, everything there has a green
                    cast (especially in foggy weather in the autumn, or during the dark days before
                    Christmas), and it’s a place that immediately reminds one of Ephesus, as it is
                    described with such singular simplicity in Acts. (Similarly, the bookshops in
                    Paris are also so interesting, in the Faubourg St Germain, for instance.) </p>

                    fervently to Him for the wisdom I’m in need of, and that He may one day grant
                    that I write and deliver many sermons, the more like our Father’s the better,

                <p> I was at Uncle Cor’s on Monday evening, and also saw Aunt and the whole family,
                    all send you their warm regards. Stayed rather a long time because I hadn’t seen
                    Aunt for a long time and one offends so easily without meaning to by giving the
                    impression of not appreciating and of neglecting people. Looked through that
                    book at Uncle’s, the engraved oeuvre of C. Daubigny. Went from there to Uncle
                    Stricker’s, Uncle was out but a son of the Rev. Meyboom was visiting (brother of
                    Margreet), an officer in the Navy, and his girlfriend and a young man,
                    Middelbeek, who has been in London for a while and is going back there.At 10
                    o’clock Uncle came home soaking wet, for it was raining quite a lot that
                    evening, and I had a long talk with him and Aunt, because Mendes had paid them a
                    visit a couple of days ago (one shouldn’t utter the word genius lightly, even if
                    one believes that there is more of it in the world than many people think, but
                    Mendes certainly is a very remarkable person, and I’m happy and grateful for my
                    contact with him) and hadn’t given them a bad report, fortunately, but <stress
                        reason="career">Uncle asked me if it wasn’t difficult, and I admitted that
                        it was very difficult and that I was doing my best to bear up and to be
                        alert in all kinds of ways.</stress> He gave me encouragement, however. But
                    now there’s still that terrible algebra and geometry, anyway, we’ll see — after
                    Christmas I have to have lessons in those as well, there’s nothing for it. </p>
                <p> I also cling to the church and to the bookshops, if I can think of an errand to
                    do there I do it. Today, for instance, I was at Schalekamp’s and at C.L.
                    Brinkman’s in Hartestraat (that shop of Schalekamp’s is an interesting sight)
                    and bought a couple of maps from the Teachers’ Society, of which there are
                    around 100 at a stuiver apiece, including the Netherlands in every possible
                    historical period. (So often, in the past as well, a visit to a bookshop has
                    cheered me up and reminded me that there are good things in the world.) </p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="environment">Sunday morning I went to the early service and
                        afterwards to the French church, where I heard an outstanding sermon from
                        the Rev. Gagnebin</unstress>: the house at Bethany. ‘One thing is needful
                    and Mary hath chosen that good part’. That Rev. Gagnebin has a pleasant
                    appearance and a worthy head, and his face has something of the Peace of God
                    which passeth all understanding. He does have something, I think, either of that
                    priest in The last victims of the terror or of that humble and faithful
                    manservant one sees in ‘The women of the boardinghouse’. </p>
                <p> That painting by Israëls you describe must be beautiful, I can picture it from
                    your clear description. Saw a small painting of his at C.M.’s, also one by
                    Mauve, very beautiful, shepherd with flock of sheep in the dunes. </p>
                <p> A good cheerful letter from home too, fortunately things seem to be going better
                    in Princenhage. I’m longing not a little for Christmas, do bring one thing and
                    another with you, as much as possible, it’s good for all of us. Don’t be in a
                    hurry to send the tobacco; still have some, it’s a good and necessary aid to
                    study. </p>
                <p> Wrote a long letter to Harry Gladwell that went off today, also sent your
                    regards. If you have the time and the opportunity, think of Michelet, you know
                    what, and J. Breton, but you know what it’s for and that there’s no hurry, and
                    if necessary Christmas is soon enough. Now, I must get to work and the sheet of
                    paper is nearly full, I wish you well, write if possible, I gave Uncle the
                    receipt enclosed in your letter. Uncle sends you his regards, also Uncle and
                    Aunt Stricker. Bid your housemates goodday from me, and should the opportunity
                    arise also Mauve and his wife and the Tersteegs and Van Stockums (how is she?)
                    and Haanebeeks, and Borchers if you run into him. Blessings on everything you
                    do, I wish you strength and vigour in these autumn days, and let it be Christmas
                    again with us together again before we know it, as it were, adieu, a handshake

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p> I feel the need to write to you again, because I often think of you and long so
                    much for Christmas, when we hope to see each other again. Well, the dark days
                    before Christmas are already in sight, and behind them lies Christmas, just like
                    the kindly light from the houses behind the rocks and the water that breaks
                    against them on a dark evening. </p>
                <p> The Christmas celebration was always a bright spot for us, and may it remain so. </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="career">An entrance exam has been held at the university here
                        for the first time — it’s here in the city that I’ll sit the exam as well.
                        In addition to the usual 4 subjects of Latin, Greek, algebra and geometry,
                        they also tested history, geography and Dutch.</stress>
                </p>
                <p> Have taken pains to find a teacher of Algebra and Geometry and have succeeded,
                    namely a cousin of Mendes, Teixeira de Mattos, a teacher at the Jewish School
                    for the Poor. He gives me hope that we’ll have met the requirements by around
                    October of next year. If I should then pass the exam, things will have gone very
                    well indeed.<stress reason="career">Because when I started they said that 2
                        years would be necessary for the first 4 subjects mentioned, whereas if I
                        should pass in October, I’ll have done more in an even shorter time. May God
                        give me the wisdom I need and grant me my heart’s desire, namely to complete
                        my studies as soon as possible and to be inducted into a living and the
                        practical duties of a minister. Doing that work, and being devoted to it, I
                        believe one would be doing what God wants one to do.</stress>
                </p>
                <p> The preparatory studies (i.e. those preceding the actual theological study and
                    practice in preaching and speaking) more or less comes down to the history,
                    languages and geography of Greece, Asia Minor (which can be taken to include
                    Palestine) and Italy. <stress reason="career">So I have to study these just as
                        diligently as a dog gnaws a bone</stress>, and similarly I should like to
                    know the languages, history and geography of the northern countries, i.e. those
                    around the North Sea and the English Channel. </p>
                <p> Have finally succeeded in making a map of Asia Minor, Greece and Italy, fairly
                    large (which now includes Paul’s travels as well), and also one of England which
                    finally has something of what I wanted it to have, at least Mendes sees it in
                    it, namely that it was not drawn without feeling and love. (I put in the names
                    from a map in the Atlas Antiquus of SprunerMenke that Mendes has, because it’s
                    one to be used for history.) Come on, do your best to take a look at that atlas
                    sometime, likewise the one by Stieler in particular. Because it is artistry.
                    (SprunerMenke, Atlas Antiquus.)On Sunday I heard the Rev. Ten Kate on John
                    XIV:16 (In my Father’s house are many mansions: Whosoever says that, what our
                    Father’s house holds in memories for us, what it promises us). He ended with:
                    The hour is coming in which the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of the
                    people and shall stand up, they that have done good, unto the Resurrection of
                    the Eternal Life. Blessed are the homesick, for they shall come home. The church
                    was so packed that I stood. </p>
                <p> Spent two evenings at Uncle Cor’s, once to look at old books (including volumes
                    of L’Illustration in which I found many old acquaintances, that is really an
                    interesting magazine, among other things an old portrait of Dickens and a
                    woodcut by De Lemud, ‘The cup of coffee’, a young man with rather severe and
                    sharp features and a serious expression who looks exactly as though he were
                    thinking about that passage from The imitation, On the monastic life, or as
                    though he were contemplating some difficult but good work or plan, as only a
                    soul in need can. Such work isn’t always the worst, but what one does in sorrow,
                    as it were, lives on. Happy the man who is instructed by Truth itself, not by
                    signs and passing words, but as it is in itself, are good words). </p>
                <p> Then I was also at Uncle Cor’s on Aunt’s birthday, i.e. last Friday, they played
                    cards that evening, and because I can’t I sat there reading A. Gruson, Histoire
                    des croisades (Panthéon classique 50 cmes). That’s a very beautiful little book,
                    I would almost say that here and there it was written with the sentiment of
                    Thijs Maris (herewith, among other things, a page that struck me), such as when
                    he paints an old castle on a rock with autumnal woods at twilight, with the
                    black fields with a peasant ploughing with a white horse in the foreground, and
                    it also made me think of Michelet and Carlyle. </p>
                <p> I should like so much for Pa to know that etching of A young citizen of the year
                    V. Do you approve of giving it on Pa’s birthday or before then, along with some
                    small photos of the Revolution, so that it forms a whole from which Pa can see
                    what we often think about? </p>
                <p> Perhaps you already know that there have been sad tidings today from Brussels,
                    that Pa has already gone there. Uncle Jan, who received a telegram containing
                    this news from Ma, telegraphed Pa and received the answer ‘Condition unchanged
                    don’t come yet I’m here’. Uncle Jan and Uncle Cor were already set to go there
                    together, now they’re awaiting further notice from faithful Pa. Will there then
                    finally be an end to that long and terrible suffering? </p>
                <p> Goodbye Theo, write soon, old boy, if you can, may God preserve our health and
                    give us the clarity of mind and the strength and vigour we need every day. Uncle
                    Jan, Uncle Cor and the Stricker family send you their regards, and accept a
                    hearty handshake in thought from </p>

                <p> That news about Uncle Hein comes while I’m writing this.Paul Stricker will in
                    all likelihood have to return to Holland because of his health. A good letter
                    from Johan van Gogh, and Willem is also doing relatively well, but does have to
                    look after himself and be careful.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p> I feel the need to write to you without waiting too long, the reason being first
                    of all that I must thank you for three things. <good_health>First of all, for
                        your excellent fourpage letter, with which you gave me the greatest
                        pleasure</good_health>, because it does one good to feel that a brother of
                    his also walks and lives on earth, <stress reason="career">when one has a lot of
                        things to think about and a lot to do, one sometimes gets the feeling, where
                        am I? what am I doing? where am I going?</stress> — and one starts to grow
                    dizzy — but then such a familiar voice, or rather familiar handwriting, makes
                    one feel firm ground beneath one’s feet again, as it were. </p>
                <p> T<good_health>hen I must thank you for an issue of the Galerie Contemporaine
                        about E. Frère. It’s very interesting and I’m happy to have something by
                        him.</good_health> And I also thank you for the 10 postage stamps, it really
                    is too much and you shouldn’t have done so much. A hearty handshake for
                    everything. </p>
                <p> Now I have a few things to tell you about St Nicholas; I received a good letter
                    from Etten with a money order for a pair of gloves enclosed. </p>
                <p> I already had some, however, so I bought something else with the money, namely
                    another map by Stieler, namely Scotland alone. At present I can get them singly
                    at Seyffardt’s, but there probably won’t always be that opportunity. I’ve drawn
                    that map and so have it double, and because I did want to give Harry Gladwell a
                    Christmas present I hope to send it to you for him, to enclose when a crate goes
                    to Paris. one must build one’s house upon a rock, Scotland, Normandy and
                    Brittany are really rather rocky, just take a look at that large map of Scotland
                    when you get it. If I compare the work of studying to the building of a house,
                    and these months to its foundation, then rocks accordingly lie at its base. </p>
                <p> But all of this by the by, now more about the evening in question. From Uncle
                    Cor I received Bossuet, Or<good_health>aisons funèbres, in a very good and handy
                        edition, very complete, it includes, among other things, the fine sermon
                        about Paul on the text ‘for when I am weak, then am I strong’. It’s a noble
                        book, you’ll see it at Christmas, I was so happy with it that until today
                        I’ve been carrying it around in my pocket,</good_health> though it’s time I
                    stopped that because something might happen to it. From Mendes I received the
                    works of Claudius, also a good, solid book; I had sent him Thomae Kempensis de
                    imitatione Christi and written in the front, There is neither Jew nor Greek in
                    Him, neither bond nor free, neither male nor female: but Christ is all, and in
                    all. From Uncle Stricker a box of cigars, you know what I did with them, they’re
                    always so friendly at the Rooses’ and I’d already been wondering if I had
                    anything to send when that box of cigars arrived as a godsend. And in the
                    evening I found a letter from Uncle Jan lying on my table. Was then briefly at
                    Vos and Kee’s, where Uncle and Aunt Stricker were as well, but couldn’t stay
                    because I had a lesson from 810 with Teixeira. Uncle Jan spent the evening at
                    Uncle Cor’s.Was at Uncle Stricker’s service this morning, i.e. in the
                    Eilandskerk, Uncle Cor was there too. The text was ‘by Thy light shall we see
                    light’. It’s always a nice walk to that Eilandskerk. This afternoon I took
                    another walk around the little English church with those maps of those rocky
                    countries, because I had a feeling that they were connected with that little
                    church. </p>
                <p> ‘The Church of God stands on a rock’, those words were in this morning’s hymn,
                    and that’s how Ruisdael painted it too, and Millet in the painting in the
                    Luxembourg. </p>
                <p> It’s a good plan of yours to write those names etc. on the map of Brittany.
                    Bring it along at Christmas, you know that I did that on the one I drew, then we
                    can compare them. Be sure and do it, for that is good. </p>
                <p> You talk about my coming to The Hague again on my way to Etten, I should really
                    like to, would it be possible to stay a night at the Rooses’? If so, then you do
                    not have to write, then I’ll count on it being possible if necessary. I should
                    like to see your room again and the tree with ivy, I hope that will be possible
                    and that I can leave here early enough. </p>
                <p> I can’t tell you how much I long for Christmas. And may Pa be satisfied with
                    what I’ve done. </p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="environment"> It was such wonderful weather today, and so
                        beautiful among those thornhedges by the little church when night began to
                        fall.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p> Had a talk with Mendes this week, or rather last week, about ‘He who hate not,
                    even his own life also, he cannot be my disciple’. He declared that expression
                    too strong, but I maintained that it was the simple truth, and doesn’t Thomas a
                    Kempis say it when he talks about knowing oneself and despising oneself? </p>
                <p>
                    <bad_health>If we look at others who have done more and are better than we are,
                        then soon enough we come to hate our own life because it’s not as good as
                        that of others.</bad_health> Just look at a man like Thomas a Kempis,
                    constrained by the love of Christ to write that little book, sincere and simple
                    and true as few others were, either before or since. Or in another sphere, just
                    take a look at the work of a Millet or that of a Stieler or The large oaks by
                    Jules Dupré. They did it: ‘let your light shine before men, that they may see
                    your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven’, and Pa is such a
                    man too; and however much we can do, you see, the best thing is to keep our
                    sights on such people and to seek whether we too may perhaps find something. And
                    to believe that it’s true what Pa said, that if someone asks ‘Lord, I should so
                    much like to be earnest’, that it will be heard and granted by God. </p>
                <p> Have a good Sunday today, how I’d like to be with you, Uncle Jan has gone to
                    Haarlem so I’m alone this evening, but still have to do as much as I possibly
                    can. You have really given me such pleasure with that magazine on E. Frère. I
                    once saw him myself at Goupil’s, he has something very unpretentious about him.
                    ‘At last, he triumphed’ it says in his biography, may it be so with us one day —
                    that can happen and it is good to say: I never despair. </p>
                <p> A person doesn’t get it all at once, and most of those who have become something
                    very good have gone through a long, difficult period of preparation that was the
                    rock upon which their house was founded. </p>
                <p> Man is depraved by nature, at best a thief — but — with God’s guidance and
                    blessing he can become something of higher worth, as there came for Paul a day
                    on which he could say with frankness and trust to Herod, I would to God, that
                    not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were such as I am, except
                    these bonds. </p>
                <p> Thanks for what you write about the lithographs. Something else —
                        <good_health>you also sent 2 pairs of Christus Consolator and pendant, I was
                        very glad to get them.</good_health> It could do no harm if you also had
                    that map of Scotland, then you would have three things from that atlas, and the
                    proverb says: all good things come in threes. So count on getting that one too,
                    and by no means buy it yourself, had first wanted to send you this one that is
                    now going to Gladwell, but I consider it my duty to let him hear from me now and
                    again. I hope he’ll be able to go to Lewisham at Christmas. You know that
                    painting by Cuyp in the museum here, an old Dutch family, when he saw that he
                    stood looking at it for a long time and then spoke of ‘the house built on the
                    rock’ and of his home in Lewisham. I, too, have memories of his father’s house
                    and will not easily forget it. Much and strong and great love lives there under
                    that roof, and its fire is in him still, it is not dead, but sleepeth. </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="career">Now I have to hurry, for I have to get to work.</stress>
                    So in all likelihood I’ll be coming to The Hague next week for a day, Thursday
                    say, possibly later, I have to see how it fits in best with my work. From The
                    Hague I hope to go to Dordrecht, and if it turns out that you can leave Saturday
                    evening, we’ll meet each other at the station in Dordrecht. </p>
                <p> In that case I would even spend two nights at the Rooses’, if I’m going to The
                    Hague anyway, it can’t hurt to stay a bit longer and call on some people. </p>
                <p> A pity, in a way, that Mauve is going to move, I hope that we’ll go there again
                    together, like that evening last spring, it was really pleasant then. </p>
                <p> Now make sure they don’t go to any trouble at the Rooses’. If I can’t stay there
                    you’ll know it without asking them and can write to me, and I’ll take it into
                    account; if I can, tell them only the day before. </p>
                <p> I wish you the very best and blessings in your work. You’ll be busy, but
                    actually one should be grateful for pressure and effort and all suchlike things
                    more than for anything else, for it is only by long training in that that one
                    develops. I sincerely hope that you’ll be able to leave Saturday, because at
                    home they’d surely like us to be in Etten the Sunday before Christmas. So
                    goodbye for now, if I hear nothing more from you I’ll come on Thursday or
                    Friday, 20 or 21 December. </p>
                <p> I finally decided to hang up that page again from Bargue’s Cours de dessin, Anne
                    of Brittany, yes, man is depraved by nature and at best a thief, but in the
                    battle of life he can become a being of higher worth; a being of higher worth,
                    those words sprang to mind when I had been looking for a long time at the
                    expression on the face of that beautiful woman Anne of Brittany, the expression
                    which explains why she also recalls the words ‘one of Sorrows and acquainted
                    with grief; sorrowful yet always rejoicing’. </p>
                <p>Adieu, give my regards to your housemates, and believe me</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p> I wish you much happiness for the new year, may it be blessed for you in many
                    ways. <good_health>Those were good days, when you were here, though they didn’t
                        last long.</good_health> My holiday will be over soon, too, but I’ll stay at
                    least a day longer because Pa’s so busy these days, and it would be good to
                    discuss calmly how best to pursue further study. </p>
                <p> Pa also has to preach at Princenhage on New Year’s Eve, because the Rev. Kuylman
                    fell and hurt himself, dislocating his arm, and so is unable to take his turn on
                    New Year’s Eve, and Pa has offered to do it for him. So Pa has to preach 9 times
                    in 10 days. </p>
                <p> If you haven’t yet sent that map. to Harry Gladwell, wait a while, I hear he’s
                    no longer in Paris, wrote to his father today. I may get a reply and will then
                    add something to the roll. </p>
                <p> You forgot to take the etching after Meissonier, I’ll send it to you one of
                    these days with the lithograph after Jules Breton, The fields in winter, because
                    I don’t want to accept it, it belongs in your collection. </p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="friendship">It snowed last week and Cor had fun with the
                        sledge and so did I, because I sledged on the road with him and a girl who
                        was staying at the Hackstrohs’.</unstress>
                    <unstress reason="family">Today Pa, Ma, Cor and I took a lovely walk</unstress>,
                    you should have been there. </p>
                <p> Yesterday I saw the sewing school that Ma now holds in the consistory, it is
                    indeed pleasant, one would like to have a painting of it, there are already
                    quite a few children coming to it. </p>
                <p> Another painting has occurred to me that is related to Brittany, namely Ribot,
                    The prayer, a number of children kneeling in a corner of a church at dusk,
                    there’s a large etching by him of the same thing, which you perhaps know. Jacque
                    once made an etching of the same subject, but smaller. </p>
                <p> Made a list today of everything I could remember about the French Revolution, so
                    as to write it on the back of the map of France, and I hope gradually to expand
                    on that work, recording, for instance, the most important things about the
                    Middle Ages, or the time of the 80 Years’ War, and so on. One must hold on to
                    what one has seen or what one knows, for it always comes in useful. </p>
                <p> If you should make such lists from time to time, send them to me when you have
                    the opportunity, then we can compare them, it’s good to do so — as far as
                    knowledge is concerned, it’s important to hold on to what one has and to absorb
                    it internally as much as one can; especially when one is short of money, it’s
                    good to fill the gaps with this and similar things.Give my regards to all your
                    housemates and wish them all the best from me. It’s not impossible that, on my
                    way to Amsterdam, I could spend another night in The Hague and bring you the
                    prints that you left here myself, but don’t count on it. </p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p> It’s Sunday evening, and I want to write a few words again, for I also really
                    long to get another letter from you, do write again soon, I am with you so often
                    in thought. I sincerely hope that you’ve had a good Sunday. </p>
                <p>
                    <good_health>As you know, Pa was here and I’m very glad of it, we went together
                        to Mendes, Uncle Stricker, Uncle Cor, Vos and Kee and both Meijjes families,
                        and the most pleasant memory of Pa’s visit is that morning we spent together
                        in my study, looking over my work and talking about all sorts of
                        things.</good_health> You can imagine that those days flew by and when,
                    after bringing Pa to the station and watching the train or even only the smoke
                    for as long as it was in sight, <bad_health>I came back to my room and Pa’s
                        chair was standing there by the little desk on which the books and notebooks
                        were still lying from the day before, even though I know that we’ll see each
                        other again quite soon, I broke down and cried like a child.</bad_health>
                </p>
                <p> You’ll already have heard that Mendes made a favourable impression on Pa as
                    well. In the evening, at Uncle Cor’s, we saw drawings and books, including
                    Doré’s Bible and Bida’s Le livre de Ruth and Histoire de Joseph. </p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="friendship">Was in the English church this morning and met
                        Wierda upon leaving the church, who had been there too. We went for a walk
                        together and he asked me if I’d like to come and see his room,</unstress> he
                    lives in Weteringstraat, about 10 minutes from Leidsestraat. I told him that for
                    a long time I had wanted to see his room and where and how he lived, so
                        <unstress reason="friendship">I went along and after drinking coffee I
                        stayed till around 3 o’clock and saw his books and heard a thing or two
                        about his life, where he had been previously and so on</unstress>, first he
                    was in Bolsward, then in Haarlem and then here. He has worked hard in his life
                    and will probably continue to do so and not give it up easily. Afterwards, at
                    home, translated a passage from Caesar, and this afternoon to Uncle Stricker’s,
                    I go there rather often now that Uncle is out of town and now that it’s lonely
                    again here in the house since Pa left. This evening they went to see Vos, who
                    isn’t any better. </p>
                <p> I still have to congratulate you on Pa’s birthday, even though it’s already been
                    and gone, it will have been a good day, with Anna there too, I’m longing for a
                    letter from home to hear how they celebrated that day. Anna was slightly
                    indisposed and hadn’t yet recovered completely, she wrote in a letter that Pa
                    received here. Perhaps Pa read Ma’s letter aloud to you, which she wrote while
                    Pa was here, it told about a visit to a sick person which sounded like something
                    out of Adam Bede.It’s foggy here today, fortunately Pa had good weather so that
                    we could walk quite a lot. </p>
                <p> I’m reminding you of that piece by Jules Breton, not that there’s any hurry, but
                    try and remember it sometime. </p>
                <p> Because in March you’ll probably make the trip again, won’t you, and also come
                    here again? </p>
                <p> Uncle Jan will most likely come back on Tuesday. </p>
                <p> You’ll certainly have a lot to do at the beginning of the year, like most
                    people. Wierda, too, unburdened himself on that score this morning. </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="career">For me, too, things are beginning to get more and more
                        serious as the exam approaches.</stress>
                    <good_health>I’ll be glad when it grows light a bit earlier in the morning and
                        we’re already beginning to get used to it.</good_health>
                </p>
                <p> Did Pa remember to give you the photograph of the Maris? The woodcut after Van
                    Goyen, Dordrecht, is hanging in its place. Went recently to see that painting
                    again here in the museum, it is good through and through. The next time you come
                    here I’d like to look through the etchings by Dürer here in the museum again, as
                    we did with Rembrandt’s last time. </p>
                <p> It’s no doubt beautiful in Scheveningen on these grey days, do you still go
                    there quite often? Perhaps it’s like that painting by Ruisdael in the museum in
                    The Hague. Do you have the lithograph of it that was once in the Kunstkronijk?
                    It’s really good. </p>
                <p> How are things going at Mauve’s? Very well, I hope. Have you been there
                    recently? </p>
                <p> I’m currently taking lessons from Uncle Stricker once or twice a week, that is a
                    bonus. Uncle is an expert in it, and I’m glad he could find the time to do it. </p>
                <p> Now, old boy, a hearty handshake in thought, I’ll set to work, give my regards
                    to your housemates, and also to Mauve if you run into him, I wish you the very
                    best, write soon, also congratulations on Anna’s birthday, even though it’s
                    still to come, and believe me ever</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>
                    <good_health>Thanks for your letter of 17 February, which gave me not a little
                        pleasure</good_health>, as I had been longing for it so very much. And I’m
                    going ahead and writing again so soon, old chap, because I think of you so often
                    and also long for you, and every morning the prints on the wall of my study
                    remind me of you, Christus Consolator and pendant, that wood engraving after Van
                    Goyen, Dordrecht, the portrait of the Rev. Heldring, The oven by T. Rousseau and
                    so on, because I got them all from you, and so the pot called the kettle black
                    when you wrote that it was so wrong of me to give you a print for your room now
                    and then, if I find something that goes with what you already have. So enough
                    about that, I say in turn, but write and tell me whether you’ve added some good
                    thing or other to your collection, do continue with it, because the way you do
                    it and set about it, it’s most certainly a good work. </p>
                <p> Yesterday evening at C.M.’s I saw a whole year of that magazine L’Art, of which
                    you have the issue with the woodcuts after Corot. <unstress reason="environment"
                        >What especially struck me were woodcuts after drawings by Millet, including
                        The leaffall (shepherd guarding his flock), The flock of crows, donkeys in a
                        marsh (misty effect), The woodcutters, Housekeeper sweeping her house,
                        Farmyard (nocturnal effect), also an etching after Corot, The dune, and
                        after Breton, The feast of Saint John and others, by Chauvel, among others,
                        and also one after Millet, The beans.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p> Was with Uncle Jan the whole afternoon and evening of Sunday, 17 Feb. at Uncle
                    Cor’s, where Aunt Antje is staying these days. </p>
                <p> It was Anna’s birthday, and it was also a good day for me. Got up quite early
                    and went in the morning to the French church, where a minister from the vicinity
                    of Lyon was preaching, he’d come to collect money for an evangelical mission.
                    His sermon consisted mainly of stories from the lives of factory workers there,
                    and although he wasn’t especially eloquent as far as ease of expression goes,
                    and though one even noticed how difficult it was for him and a little awkward,
                    as it were, his words were moving nonetheless, because they came from the heart,
                    and that alone has the power to make an impression on other hearts. Afterwards,
                    at 1 o’clock, I had to be at a Sunday school given by an English minister,
                    Adler, in Barndesteeg, he has a small but very respectable old church there. The
                    school, though, was held in a small room where the light had to be lit even at
                    that hour, i.e. in the middle of the day. There were perhaps some 20 children
                    from that poor neighbourhood. Although he’s a foreigner he nevertheless preaches
                    in Dutch (though the English service), and also gives confirmation classes in
                    Dutch, but very charmingly and capably. <work origin="existing" stage="finished"
                        >Had taken along the sketch of that map of the Holy Land that I’d made for
                        Pa’s birthday </work>(with red chalk on heavy brown paper) and I gave it to
                    him, because I thought that little room a nice place for it, and I’m glad it’s
                    hanging on the wall there. </p>
                <p> Had met him at Mr Macfarlane’s, the minister of that little English church in
                    the Begijnhof, where I had ventured to pay a visit. Was received with kindness
                    and hope to go there again sometime.I then paid a visit on Sunday afternoon to
                    Vos, who is but poorly and was lying in bed to rest a little, so I couldn’t see
                    him. And then on to Uncle Stricker and after that to Uncle Cor. This morning I
                    went back to see Vos, for I really wanted to see and speak to him myself. This
                    time I found him up, but he doesn’t look at all well and Kee looked rather tired
                    and pale too. </p>
                <p> Spent a long time there, they have a lot of worries, he brings up blood now and
                    then and coughs a lot. Jan is staying at Uncle Stricker’s for a few days. </p>
                <p> Apart from visiting the English minister, I also ventured to pay a visit to the
                    Rev. Gagnebin. Now that I’m really getting down to work and have thrown myself
                    into the fight, it’s important to try to do it boldly and to set to work with
                    relative forthrightness, even though there are still many obstacles to be
                    overcome. By working and doing, one grows into the work and the doing of it, and
                    perhaps the best way to acquire sufficient enthusiasm is to take the enthusiasm
                    one has in oneself and to employ it and expend it and use it. </p>
                <p> The Rev. Gagnebin took it well and said that I should come back one evening,
                    deciding on this evening, so I have to go there directly, and hope still to
                    write and tell you how it was. Pa also advised me to try and make the
                    acquaintance of a person or two. I did find it pleasant to speak French and
                    English again; it’s a strange feeling if one hasn’t done it for a long time. Old
                    boy, Dickens knew it, didn’t he, when he prayed, Lord keep my memory green yea
                    evergreen. Amen. </p>
                <p>
                    <work origin="existing" stage="middle">Twice I got up early in the morning to
                        work on a sketch of the map of the journeys of Paul that I still had, making
                        it more complete, so that now it looks good, with the names in French
                    </work>even better than on the ones I made for Pa and for my study, with the
                    idea of giving it to him, for if possible I wanted to highlight this visit,
                    because he’s a clever man from whom I may get good advice later on, once he
                    notices from one thing and another that I take it seriously. Also showed him the
                    map of Brittany and Normandy and some French texts I have. </p>
                <p> Last week Nico Mager, who’s here in town, came to visit, and that pleased me.
                    The contract he has with Mr Braat will expire in October or November, so he is
                    free, but also compelled by necessity, to seek another position. He’s thinking
                    of venturing abroad and had his eye on Geneva, where he’s been before, perhaps
                    that isn’t such a bad plan after all. If now, meaning by October, there was a
                    vacancy at Goupil’s, that would help him out immediately. He was planning to
                    write to Uncle Cent again, around Uncle’s birthday on 28 March. I’ve seen that
                    he can work well. He’s a nice chap, he asked me to send you his regards if I
                    wrote. From him I also heard some news from Dordrecht. Lord keep my memory
                    green. </p>
                <p> I took a walk with him as well. Also told him that I thought that a young man
                    who knew what he knew – namely what one learns when one has worked diligently
                    for some years in a bookshop or similar position – is almost sure to find, after
                    a time of searching and difficulties in London or some other large English city,
                    a position in which he could earn enough to support himself while also learning
                    to speak good English. That once he had found something like that he could count
                    on its being permanent, and that he would thus be secure, as it were, for a few
                    years.One can profit a great deal, especially when one does more than the shop
                    assistants there tend to do, and England certainly has an advantage over Paris
                    in that one has a better chance of finding decent lodgings and a kind of home in
                    middleclass surroundings, which is rather difficult in Paris. And I also told
                    him to ‘hold fast to that which you have already’ and to go forth and see with
                    your own eyes, because having been in a bookshop for so long and having worked
                    there faithfully, as he has done, is an asset. </p>
                <p> You must write again soon, and as soon as you know when you’ll be making the
                    trip, I’ll no doubt hear it, and I sincerely hope that when you’re here we’ll be
                    able to spend some time together and that you won’t be too busy. </p>
                <p> Was just at the Rev. Gagnebin’s, but was told he was too busy to receive me (and
                    yet he’d stipulated this hour and this day). I heard music in the house, so
                    apparently something or other was going on. I left what I’d made for him and
                    asked for it to be given to him. </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="career">I feel the need to do something like that now and then,
                        for it’s most certainly in doubt whether I’ll pass, i.e. all of the
                        requirements, 5 years at the least is a long time, if one begins younger
                        then one succeeds much more easily. </stress>Though I can work more and am
                    better able to keep clear from distractions, and I have no desire for those
                    things which many another craves, even so, I notice that I have difficulty
                    learning. And in case I don’t pass, I want nevertheless to be sure of having
                    left a sign of life here and there. </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="career">It’s an amazing amount that one has to know, and even
                        though they try to reassure me, it constantly gives me an indescribably
                        strong feeling of fear, and there’s nothing for it but to get back to work
                        again, for it has been clearly shown that I must do it, no matter what the
                        cost.</stress> Onwards, then, because standing still or going downhill are
                    things I’d rather not think about. If one did that, one would make things even
                    more difficult and become confused, and actually end up having to start all over
                    from the beginning. </p>
                <p> It’s already rather late and I’m really quite tired, for I’ve also walked a lot
                    today. What would it be like at Vos’s? At night he probably often has a bad time
                    of it, what with coughing and bringing up blood. </p>
                <p> A good letter from home, fortunately it appears that the journey agreed with Pa.
                    I’m longing to hear how Anna’s birthday was, in all likelihood she’ll celebrate
                    her next one in her own house. </p>
                <p> I wish you the very best and blessings on your work and everything you do, write
                    again soon if you can. Give my regards to everyone at the Rooses’, and accept in
                    thought a hearty handshake. Goodnight, and believe me </p>

                <p>Tuesday morning. Apropos. Have you sent those maps to Gladwell, i.e. to London?
                    Haven’t heard from him lately, and should like to know how he is and what his
                    plans are. It’s wonderful weather this morning, must go to Mendes in a little
                    while.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p> It’s time to write to you again, how I should like to have been with you today,
                        <unstress reason="environment">it was such beautiful weather here, and one
                        feels that spring is coming.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p> In the country one would probably have been able to hear a lark, but that’s
                    difficult in the city, unless one notices the sounds of the lark’s song in the
                    voice of some old minister whose words come from a heart tuned like a lark’s. </p>
                <p> Heard the Rev. Laurillard this morning, preaching in the Oudezijdskapel, Uncle
                    Stricker was in that church too, and I had coffee with him. Uncle Jan went this
                    morning to ’t Nieuwe Diep, but has come back again. Then to a Sunday school in
                    Barndesteeg, and then walked around the outer canals, visiting three Roman
                    Catholic churches along the way. </p>
                <p> Went yesterday to see Vos who is but poorly, it’s such a sad sight, seeing him
                    sitting with his feet on a stove, for he’s troubled by cold feet, staring out
                    the window with his hollow eyes. Kee is just as pale and looks so tired, went
                    from there to Uncle Cor’s again, he’s had the gallery newly wallpapered and a
                    new grey carpet laid on the floor, now those beautiful cupboards containing the
                    whole Gazette des BeauxArts etc. in red volumes stand out better than
                        before.<bad_health> Uncle told me that Daubigny has died, I freely admit
                        that it made me sad to hear it,</bad_health> just as it did to hear that
                    Brion had died (his Saying grace is hanging in my room), because the work of
                    such men, if one understands it, moves one more deeply than one is aware of, it
                    must be truly good, when one dies, to be conscious of having done a thing or two
                    in truth, knowing that as a result one will continue to live in the memory of at
                    least a few, and having left a good example to those who follow. A work that is
                    good — it can hardly last for eternity but the idea expressed in it can, and the
                    work itself almost certainly continues to exist for a long time and, if others
                    appear later, they can do no better than to follow in the footsteps of such
                    predecessors and to do it the same way. </p>
                <p> Speaking of a good work, would you care to have a Flemish Imitation of Christ? I
                    hope to send it to you shortly, a little book that one can easily put in one’s
                    pocket if necessary. </p>
                <p> When Uncle told me about Daubigny, his etchings after Ruisdael, The bush and The
                    ray of sunlight, came to mind, and he promised to send for them sometime, since
                    he didn’t know them at all. </p>
                <p> Was at the Rev. Gagnebin’s last Monday evening and also saw his wife and
                    daughter, and was also in his study, where I talked to him until about 11
                    o’clock. </p>
                <p> He said, among other things, that at certain times in his life he had benefited
                    from forgetting himself altogether and throwing himself into work without a
                    second thought; that he had done a lot then and had later found himself stronger
                    and more advanced in what he intended to do and clear in his mind. That
                    nevertheless, even now, nobody had any idea how much effort his sermons cost
                    him. <work origin="new" stage="finished">Have worked my way through the history
                        of the Netherlands and made an extract of 30 pages, closely written. (I was
                        pleased to come across the Battle of Waterloo and the 10day campaign
                        again.)</work> Did you know that Rochussen once painted the siege of Leiden?
                    The painting belongs, I think, to Mr de Vos.<work stage="middle" origin="new">
                        Am now working on general history as well.</work> I really long for you to
                    come here again, be sure and do your best to stay as long as possible. And write
                    again soon if you can, for you must know that you always give me so much joy by
                    doing so. </p>
                <p> Have you read anything beautiful lately? Do make sure somehow to get hold of and
                    read the books by Eliot, you won’t be sorry, Adam Bede, Silas Marner, Felix
                    Holt, Romola (Savonarola’s story), Scenes of clerical life. You know we gave the
                    3 underlined ones to Pa on his birthday last year. </p>
                <p> When I get the time for reading, I’ll read them again. Both the Rev. Macfarlane
                    and the Rev. Adler spoke to me about them, i.e. advised me to read them. </p>
                <p> Wrote to Harry Gladwell again this week, since he didn’t answer my last letter
                    and I wanted so much to know what he’s doing and what he’s planning to do. </p>
                <p> I still have hopes of his becoming a minister, and if that happens he’ll do it
                    well, of that I’m convinced, but it would be no easy thing for him to carry it
                    off. </p>
                <p> Have you ever seen an etching by Millet himself, a man pushing a wheelbarrow of
                    dung into a garden on a day like today in early spring? And don’t forget that he
                    also made the etching ‘The diggers’, if you ever run into it you won’t easily
                    forget it. Thought today of the former, this morning when Uncle Stricker was
                    looking for texts in which the word dung occurs, one of which is ‘let it alone
                    this year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung it’. </p>
                <p> Recently made a list of the paintings by Brion that I could remember, next time
                    you come you must tell me whether I’ve forgotten many. Lord keep my memory
                    green! One must say that over and over again. </p>
                <p> Was last Sunday evening at cousin Vrijdag’s in Houttuinen, there are still 7
                    children at home, it was a pleasant little circle, most of them are still very
                    young. </p>
                <p> Couldn’t you say a bit in advance when you’ll be coming? I’ll count on it, then,
                    by working ahead a little so we can spend some time together. Adieu, a handshake
                    in thought, and believe me</p>

            <head>
                <location>Amsterdam</location>, Wednesday, <date>3 April 1878</date>.</head>
            <salutation/>
            <body>
                <p> I’ve been thinking about what we discussed, and I couldn’t help thinking of the
                    words ‘we are today what we were yesterday’. This isn’t to say that one must
                    stand still and ought not try to develop oneself, on the contrary, there are
                    compelling reasons to do and think so. </p>
                <p> But in order to remain faithful to those words one may not retreat and, once one
                    has started to see things with a clear and trusting eye, one ought not to
                    abandon or deviate from that. </p>
                <p> They who said ‘we are today what we were yesterday’, those were honnêtes hommes,
                    which is apparent from the constitution they drew up, which will remain for all
                    time and of which it has rightly been said that it was written with a ray from
                    on high and a finger of fire. It is good to be an ‘honnête homme’ and truly to
                    endeavour to become one both almost and altogether, and one does well if one
                    believes that being an ‘homme intérieur et spirituel’ is part of it. </p>
                <p> If one only knew for certain that one belonged among them, one would always go
                    one’s way, calmly and collectedly, never doubting that things would turn out
                    well. There was once a man who went into a church one day and asked, can it be
                    that my zeal has deceived me, that I have turned down the wrong path and have
                    gone about things the wrong way, oh, if only I could rid myself of this
                    uncertainty and have the firm conviction that I will eventually overcome and
                    succeed. And then a voice answered him, And if you knew that for certain, what
                    would you do? Act now as though you knew it for certain and thou shalt not be
                    ashamed. Then the man went on his way, not faithless but believing, and returned
                    to his work, no longer doubting or wavering. </p>
                <p> As far as being an homme intérieur et spirituel is concerned, couldn’t one
                    develop that in oneself through knowledge of history in general and of certain
                    people of all eras in particular, from biblical times to the Revolution and from
                    The odyssey to the books of Dickens and Michelet? And couldn’t one learn
                    something from the work of the likes of Rembrandt or from Weeds by Breton, or
                    The four times of the day by Millet, or Saying grace by Degroux, or Brion, or
                    The conscript by Degroux (or else by Conscience), or his Apothecary, or The
                    large oaks by Dupré, or even the mills and sand flats by Michel? It’s by
                    persevering in those ideas and things that one at last becomes thoroughly
                    leavened with a good leaven, that of sorrowful yet alway rejoicing, and which
                    will become apparent when the time of fruitfulness is come in our lives, the
                    fruitfulness of good works. </p>
                <p> The ray from on high doesn’t always shine on us, and is sometimes behind the
                    clouds, and without that light a person cannot live and is worth nothing and can
                    do nothing good, and anyone who maintains that one can live without faith in
                    that higher light and doesn’t worry about attaining it will end up being
                    disappointed. </p>
                <p> We’ve talked quite a lot about what we feel to be our duty and how we should
                    arrive at something good, and we rightly came to the conclusion that first of
                    all our goal must be to find a certain position and a profession to which we can
                    devote ourselves entirely. </p>
                <p> And I think that we also agreed on this point, namely that one must pay special
                    attention to the end, and that a victory achieved after lifelong work and effort
                    is better than one achieved more quickly. </p>
                <p> He who lives uprightly and experiences true difficulty and disappointment and is
                    nonetheless undefeated by it is worth more than someone who prospers and knows
                    nothing but relative good fortune. For who are they, those in whom one most
                    clearly notices something higher? — it is those to whom the words ‘workers, your
                    life is sad, workers, you suffer in life, workers, you are blessed’ are
                    applicable, it is those who show the signs of ‘bearing a whole life of strife
                    and work without giving way’. It is good to try and become thus. </p>
                <p> So we go on our way ‘undefessi favente Deo’. </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="career">As far as I’m concerned, I must become a good minister,
                        who has something to say that is good and can be useful in the world, and
                        perhaps it’s good after all that I have a relatively long time of
                        preparation and become secure in a firm conviction before I’m called upon to
                        speak about it to others.</stress> It is wise, before one begins that work,
                    to gather together a wealth of things that could benefit others. </p>
                <p> Do let us go on quietly, examining all things and holding fast to that which is
                    good, and trying always to learn more that is useful, and gaining more
                    experience. </p>
                <p> Woespiritedness is quite a good thing to have, if only one writes it as two
                    words, woe is in all people, everyone has reason enough for it, but one must
                    also have spirit, the more the better, and it is good to be someone who never
                    despairs. If we but try to live uprightly, then we shall be all right, even
                    though we shall inevitably experience true sorrow and genuine disappointments,
                    and also probably make real mistakes and do wrong things, but it’s certainly
                    true that it is better to be fervent in spirit, even if one accordingly makes
                    more mistakes, than narrowminded and overly cautious. It is good to love as much
                    as one can, for therein lies true strength, and he who loves much does much and
                    is capable of much, and that which is done with love is well done. If one is
                    moved by some book or other, for instance, just to mention something, ‘The
                    swallow, the lark, the nightingale’, The longing for autumn, ‘From here I see a
                    lady’, ‘Never this unique little village’ by Michelet, it’s because it’s written
                    from the heart in simplicity and with poverty of spirit. </p>
                <p> If one were to say but few words, though ones with meaning, one would do better
                    than to say many that were only empty sounds, and just as easy to utter as they
                    were of little use. </p>
                <p> Love is the best and most noble thing in the human heart, especially when it has
                    been tried and tested in life like gold in the fire, happy is he and strong in
                    himself who has loved much and, even if he has wavered and doubted, has kept
                    that divine fire and has returned to that which was in the beginning and shall
                    never die. If only one continues to love faithfully that which is verily worthy
                    of love, and does not squander his love on truly trivial and insignificant and
                    fainthearted things, then one will gradually become more enlightened and
                    stronger. The sooner one seeks to become competent in a certain position and in
                    a certain profession, and adopts a fairly independent way of thinking and
                    acting, and the more one observes fixed rules, the stronger one’s character
                    becomes, and yet that doesn’t mean that one has to become narrowminded. </p>
                <p> It is wise to do that, for life is but short and time passes quickly. If one is
                    competent in one thing and understands one thing well, one gains at the same
                    time insight into and knowledge of many other things into the bargain. </p>
                <p> It’s sometimes good to go about much in the world and to be among people, and at
                    times one is actually obliged and called upon to do so, or it can be one way of
                    ‘throwing oneself into one’s work unreservedly and with all one’s might’, but he
                    who actually goes quietly about his work, alone, preferring to have but very few
                    friends, goes the most safely among people and in the world. One should never
                    trust it when one is without difficulties or some worry or obstacle, and one
                    shouldn’t make things too easy for oneself. Even in the most cultured circles
                    and the best surroundings and circumstances, one should retain something of the
                    original nature of a Robinson Crusoe or a savage, for otherwise one hath not
                    root in himself, and never let the fire in his soul go out but keep it going,
                    there will always be a time when it will come in useful. And whosoever continues
                    to hold fast to poverty for himself, and embraces it, possesses a great treasure
                    and will always hear the voice of his conscience speaking clearly. Whosoever
                    hears and follows the voice in his innermost being, which is God’s best gift,
                    ultimately finds therein a friend and is never alone. Happy is he who has faith
                    in God, for he shall overcome all of life’s difficulties in the end, though it
                    be not without pain and sorrow. One cannot do better than to hold fast to the
                    thought of God and endeavour to learn more of Him, amidst everything, in all
                    circumstances, in all places and at all times; one can do this with the Bible as
                    with all other things. It is good to go on believing that everything is
                    miraculous, more so than one can comprehend, for that is the truth, it is good
                    to remain sensitive and lowly and meek in heart, even though one sometimes has
                    to hide that feeling, because that is often necessary, it is good to be very
                    knowledgeable about the things that are hidden from the wise and prudent of the
                    world but that are revealed as though by nature to the poor and simple, to women
                    and babes. For what can one learn that is better than that which God has put by
                    nature into every human soul, that which in the depths of every soul lives and
                    loves, hopes and believes, unless one should wilfully destroy it? There, in
                    that, is the need for nothing less than the boundless and miraculous, and a man
                    does well if he is satisfied with nothing less and doesn’t feel at home until he
                    has acquired it. </p>
                <p> That is the avowal that all great men have expressed in their works, all who
                    have thought a little more deeply and have sought and worked a little harder and
                    have loved more than others, who have launched out into the deep of the sea of
                    life. Launching out into the deep is what we too must do if we want to catch
                    anything, and if it sometimes happens that we have to work the whole night and
                    catch nothing, then it is good not to give up after all but to let down the nets
                    again at dawn. </p>
                <p> So let us simply go on quietly, each his own way, always following the light
                    ‘sursum corda’, and as such who know that we are what others are and that others
                    are what we are, and that it is good to have love one to another namely of the
                    best kind, that believeth all things and hopeth all things, endureth all things
                    and never faileth. </p>
                <p> And not troubling ourselves too much if we have shortcomings, for he who has
                    none has a shortcoming nonetheless, namely that he has none, and he who thinks
                    he is perfectly wise would do well to start over from the beginning and become a
                    fool. </p>
                <p> We are today what we were yesterday, namely ‘honnêtes hommes’, but ones who must
                    be tried with the fire of life to be innerly strengthened and confirmed in that
                    which they are by nature through the grace of God. </p>
                <p>May it be so with us, old boy, and I wish you well on your way, and God be with
                    you in all things, and make you succeed at that, that is what is wished you with
                    a hearty handshake at your departure by</p>

            <salutation>&gt;My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p> It’s time you received a few words from me, Pa already wrote that you’ve arrived
                    safely and have already written how you roamed around the city the first few
                    days. I’m really longing to hear what your impressions are of this and that, and
                    that’s why I urge you to write a few words as soon as you can find the time.
                    It’s true, though, that first impressions don’t last, for we know all too well
                    that all that glitters is not gold, and that when there is a friendly dawn there
                    is a midnight too, and scorching and oppressive heat in the afternoon. But just
                    as the morning hour is a blessed hour and the early bird catches the worm, so it
                    is with first impressions, and they have their value even though they pass, for
                    it is they which later appear to have been correct, and one comes back to them.
                    The first thing that attracts and strikes a child is the light, and an old man
                    also searches again fearfully for it. So write and tell me what you saw during
                    those first few days, and what you thought. </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="family">You’ll have heard that Lies didn’t pass her exam and has
                        fallen ill, and that because she longed so much for home, Ma went to fetch
                        her, poor girl, it will be no small disappointment for her and for everyone
                        at home, and yesterday was perhaps a less cheerful Sunday.</stress> Pa
                    nevertheless wrote again, and in his mouth that is the truth, that with all
                    disappointment and at every serious moment of life, faith becomes more alive and
                    stronger. </p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="environment"> The weather has been beautiful here the last few
                        days, and probably in Paris too. You’ll soon notice that in the summer it’s
                        at times rather warmer there than it is here, and you’ll probably see stormy
                        skies like those Bonington painted.</unstress> It’s really a nice
                    neighbourhood where you live. If one roams the streets there, whether in the
                    morning or evening, or walks in the direction of Montmartre, one is struck by
                    many workshops and many rooms that recall ‘a cooper’ or The seamstresses or
                    other paintings by E. Frère, and it does one good sometimes to see such things,
                    which are simple, as one occasionally sees a good many people who for various
                    reasons have strayed a long way from everything that is natural, thereby
                    throwing away their true and inner lives, and also many who are rooted in misery
                    and loathsome things, because in the evening and at night one sees all manner of
                    those dark figures walking about, both men and women, who personify, as it were,
                    the terror of the night, and whose misery must be classified among the things
                    that have no name in any language. </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="friendship">Vos isn’t well, he has coughed up blood again more
                        than once. </stress>Was there recently one afternoon when he was up, sitting
                    hand in hand with Kee, both of them dressed in black and their faces equally
                    pale, looking out of the window at the Church and the trees across the street,
                    when there was a dark stormy sky and the leaves and the dust were whirling
                    around in a strange way and the pavingstones looked so much whiter than usual,
                    and the little black figures of the people stood out against them so much more
                    sharply, as is often the case before a thunderstorm. He has become so much paler
                    and thinner than when you saw him, and sometimes looks like a ghost. It has
                    become a veritable house of mourning, and Uncle Stricker’s too, in fact, for
                    when one member suffers, all the members suffer with it, for they have been
                    planted together. </p>
                <p> Last week one of the ministers here died who was very well known throughout the
                    country (Pantekoek). The funeral was on Saturday, it was something that reminded
                    one of ‘In memoriam’, that procession along the path by the green borders of the
                    Amstel. He was the father of 6 children, the eldest around 20. A very large
                    crowd followed, literally jostling one another. Yesterday there were sermons
                    occasioned by the event in nearly every church. Heard Uncle Stricker, among
                    others, who had been a close acquaintance of his. It was his turn to preach in
                    the Oudezijdskapel, where the boys from the orphanage and those from the
                    nautical college usually go. There was a lot of spirit in it, spoke, among other
                    things, of the words: Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? It was a
                    long and terrible suffering that was his lot. Heard one of his last sermons one
                    evening, and even then it was clearly evident from what he said that he trembled
                    at and recoiled from each new day and night, and especially from one that
                    followed upon the effort of preaching. Even then one couldn’t hear him without
                    feeling for him, as it were, and one couldn’t help shuddering, for it is a dark
                    path, the one to his long home, and happy is he who, when that darkness and
                    night are approaching, is strengthened even then by the hope for a better life
                    and the resurrection as we know befell Mary Magdalen and Him Whom she supposed
                    to be the gardener in the garden by the sepulchre, by the hope: who knows what
                    shall be on the morrow? Saw his son yesterday at the early service, if one can
                    compare the faces of people with other faces, then his looks very much like an
                    eagle, especially then, when he was stricken by what had just happened. </p>
                <p> You must try to read some beautiful book or other over there, by Michelet, for
                    instance, on the Revolution or something by Thoré or T. Gautier on Paris and the
                    time of the young painters and writers. Oh, old boy, how I’d like to roam
                    through the city with you. </p>
                <p> Hope to take a long walk today through a neighbourhood I haven’t seen much of
                    yet. I found the house in Breestraat where Rembrandt lived. We talked about it,
                    you know, when you were here. </p>
                <p> Don’t forget about that painting in the Luxembourg, He that receiveth you
                    receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me, and write and
                    tell me who made it. </p>
                <p> It can be so glorious in Paris in the autumn, well, you’ll be seeing something
                    of it at the end of September. </p>
                <p> Give my warm regards to everyone at the Soeks’, I still think so often of an
                    excursion I made with his family to Villed’Avray. Going into the church there,
                    it struck me that there was, I believe, even more than one painting by Corot
                    hanging there. You know that he spent a lot of time there. </p>
                <p>Bid goodday to Braat, and Mutters too. I wish you well, and write soon, and
                    accept in thought a hearty handshake, and believe me ever</p>

                <location>Etten</location>, Monday, <date>22 July 1878</date>.</head>
            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p> I’m enclosing a note in the letter from Pa and Ma; was glad to hear things are
                    still going well for you there, and that you also continue to enjoy life. How
                    much I’d like to walk with you there. </p>
                <p> As Pa has certainly already written to you, Pa and I went to Brussels last week
                    in the company of the Rev. Jones of Isleworth, who stayed here over Sunday. The
                    impression we brought home from that journey was satisfactory inasmuch as we
                    think that, with time, a place and position can be found there — that the road
                    is most certainly shorter and less expensive than in Holland, and that it’s
                    therefore best to fix our eyes on Belgium and to go on looking there until we
                    find something. </p>
                <p> We saw the Flemish training college, it has a 3year course while, as you know,
                    in Holland the study would take another 6 years at the very least. And one is
                    not even required to complete the training before competing for a place and
                    position as an Evangelist. What is required is the talent to give easy,
                    warmhearted and popular lectures or speeches to the people, better short and to
                    the point than long and learned. So less attention is paid to great knowledge of
                    ancient languages and much theological study, although everything one knows
                    about such things is a great recommendation, and more consideration is given to
                    one’s suitability for practical work and one’s natural faith. <stress
                        reason="career">We aren’t there yet, though, first of all because one
                        doesn’t suddenly possess, nor can one acquire it except by much practice,
                        the gift of speaking to the people with earnestness and feeling and without
                        stiffness and forcedness, but naturally and as though constrained by love
                        and as a master of his subject matter, knowing how to say what one has to
                        say to the people clearly and understandably, while what one has to say must
                        have meaning and import and strong grounds to whet his listeners’ interest
                        in it, that they shall endeavour to let their affections take root in
                        truth.</stress> In a word, one must be a lay preacher to succeed over
                    there.Those gentlemen in Brussels wanted me to come there for a period of 3
                    months to make closer acquaintance, but in the long run this, too, would be
                    costly, and that must be avoided as much as possible. It’s for this reason that
                    at present I shall continue here in Etten to do some work as preparation, going
                    from here from time to time to pay a visit to the Rev. Pieterszen in Mechelen or
                    the Rev. De Jonge in Brussels, in so doing becoming more closely acquainted with
                    one another. </p>
                <p> How long things go on like this depends entirely on what else they’ll say over
                    there. Both Pa and I have just written to them again. </p>
                <p> Pa wants me to write, to the best of my ability, a theme or two to have on hand
                        (<work origin="new" stage="middle">I’m now busy, for instance, on
                        Rembrandt’s painting ‘The carpenter’s house’ in the Louvr</work>e). </p>
                <p> Yesterday Pa had to preach at Zundert, and I went along. The Aunts sent you
                    their regards, we also went to C. van Ginneken who, as you’ve probably heard, is
                    going to marry Marie van Mens and has bought the Ropsentuin to put a tannery
                    there. </p>
                <p> Was also at Jan Doomen’s, who has been suffering a lot from rheumatism in his
                    leg, and complains that he wouldn’t even be able to walk to Breda any more, but
                    it didn’t bother him so much working in the field or the garden, only in the
                    morning the pain drove him to get up very early. Old age is accompanied by
                    ailments, the old Rev. Meijjes would say. </p>
                <p> What an outstandingly beautiful wood engraving of ‘A young citizen of the year
                    V’ by Jules Goupil was recently published in L’Illustration! Have you seen it?
                    Have managed to get hold of one and it’s now hanging on the wall of the little
                    room here where I’m allowed to take up residence, i.e. the classroom that looks
                    out on the garden and against which the ivy grows. But regarding that painting,
                    the magazine said this: ‘Eyes that have seen the spectacle of the dreadful
                    guillotine, a mind that has survived all the sights of the Revolution. He is
                    almost surprised to find himself still alive after so many disasters’. </p>
                <p> It was a remarkable presence in art and will continue to have a similar effect
                    on many and continue to make a deep impression on those with a feeling for high
                    art, like a portrait by Fabritius or some other rather mystical paintings from
                    the school of Rembrandt. </p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="environment">In the evening, when we rode back from Zundert
                        over the heath, Pa and I walked a way, the sun set red behind the pines and
                        the evening sky was reflected in the marshes, the heath and the yellow and
                        white and grey sand were so resonant with tone and atmosphere.</unstress>
                    <good_health>You see, there are moments in life when everything, within us too,
                        is peace and atmosphere, and all of life seems to be like a path across the
                        heath, though it isn’t always so.</good_health>
                </p>
                <p> And this morning Cor, who’s on holiday, and I went to the heath and the pinewood
                    again, a way past Molenend, and went to fetch heather for his rabbits, which are
                    apparently very fond of it, for it’s their natural food for a good part, as well
                    as a thing or two to fill a flower basket. We sat for a while in the pinewood,
                    and together we drew a map of Etten and its surroundings with the Bremberg and
                    Haansberg and ’t Slagveld and Geestestraat and Sprundel and Het Heike and
                    Hoeven. </p>
                <p> Anna is but poorly, she’s so quiet and sometimes looks so very weak — poor
                    sister — it seems to me that it’s better to be well and truly married than to be
                    engaged, and I should sincerely wish for her sake that she were already safely
                    three years or so further along in life — may God spare her and protect her from
                    all evil, He about Whom it is written that He is our Keeper and our Shade upon
                    our right hand. </p>
                <p> Would you give my warm regards to Soek and all his family (if you happen to go
                    there), also to Frans Braat and Ernest and the others if the opportunity should
                    arise? I think about you a lot and am so glad that things are going well for you
                    and that you’re finding things over there that stimulate you and are, as it
                    were, good food for the true life. That too is high art, as are the works of
                    those who work with their heart and with their mind and spirit, just as so many
                    you know and will perhaps meet personally, whose words and works are spirit and
                    life. That you too, and, if possible, all of us may become more and more rooted
                    and grounded in that same principle, so that our affections take root in truth,
                    this is wished you with a hearty handshake in thought by </p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p> I’m enclosing a few words with Pa and Ma’s letter to bid you good morning. It’s
                    raining outside and has done so a lot lately, with strong winds too. It was nice
                    the day Anna and Joan registered their banns. Now that Joan is here, Anna looks
                    a lot more cheerful and better than before. For their honeymoon they’re thinking
                    of making a journey through Belgium, first to Brussels and from there probably
                    south to Liège or Chaudfontaine or the cave in Han. Wrote and told the Rev. De
                    Jonge that I was ready to come to Brussels straightaway if work or duty should
                    call me, but that if there were no sound reasons that made it desirable for me
                    to go there now, I’d like to stay here another week (because of Anna’s wedding),
                    coming in that case before Sunday, 25 Aug. I’m very curious to know whether the
                    exhibition of paintings there will still be open, I should so much like to see
                    it. </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="family">Things are very sad at Princenhage, Aunt suffers a lot,
                        and they’re all very worried about her.</stress>
                </p>
                <p> I long for a word from you, hope to write to you in more detail as soon as I’m
                    in Brussels, also about the exhibition, at least if it isn’t over yet. </p>
                <p> Give my regards to Braat and Soek, if you see them, and Ernest. Adieu, I wish
                    you the very best, not a day goes by that we don’t speak of you. Do write again
                    soon, and accept a hearty handshake in thought from </p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p> On the evening of the day we spent together, which for me passed as if in a
                    twinkling, I want to write to you after all. <good_health>It was a great joy for
                        me to see and talk to you again, and it’s fortunate that such a day that
                        passes in a twinkling and a joy of such short duration nevertheless remains
                        in our memory, and that the remembrance of it is of a lasting
                        nature.</good_health> After we’d taken leave of each other I walked back,
                    not the shortest way but along Trekweg. There are workshops of all kinds there
                    that look pleasant, especially lit up in the evening, which also speak in their
                    own way to us who are, after all, labourers and workers, each in the sphere and
                    in the work whereunto we have been called, if only we care to listen, for they
                    say, work while it is day, before the night cometh, when no man can work, and
                    they remind us that the Father worketh hitherto, and that we too must work. </p>
                <p> It was the very moment when the streetsweepers were coming home with their carts
                    with old white horses, there was a long line of those carts standing by the
                    socalled sludge works at the beginning of Trekweg. Some of those old white
                    horses resemble a certain old aquatint that you perhaps know, an engraving with
                    no very great artistic value but which nevertheless struck me and made an
                    impression on me. I mean the last of the series of prints titled ‘The life of a
                    horse’. That print depicts an old white horse, emaciated and spent and worn out
                    to death by a long life of heavy labour and much and difficult work. The poor
                    animal stands in an indescribably lonely and forsaken place, a plain with lank,
                    withered grass and here and there a twisted tree, bent and cracked by the storm
                    wind. On the ground lies a skull and in the distance, in the background, the
                    bleached skeleton of a horse lying next to a hut, where the man who slaughters
                    horses lives. </p>
                <p> A stormy sky hangs over the whole, it’s a foul and bleak day, sombre and dark
                    weather. It’s a sorrowful and profoundly melancholy scene that must move
                    everyone who knows and feels that we, too, must one day go through that which we
                    call dying, and that at the end of human life there are tears or grey hair. What
                    lies beyond is a great mystery that God alone comprehends, who has however
                    revealed this irrefutably in His word, that there is a resurrection of the dead. </p>
                <p> The poor horse — the old faithful servant, stands patient and submissive, but
                    courageous nonetheless and as resolute, as it were, as the old guard who said
                    ‘the guard dies but does not surrender’ — waits for its final hour. I couldn’t
                    help thinking of that print this evening when I saw those dustcart horses. And
                    now, as far as the drivers themselves are concerned, with their dirty, dingy
                    clothes, they seemed to be sunk or rooted in poverty almost more deeply than
                    that long row or rather group of poor people drawn by master Degroux in his
                    paupers’ pew. Write and tell me if you know that print. I’d like to speak to the
                    dustmen, if they would only come and sit in the paupers’ pew and consider it
                    worthwhile to come and hear about the gospel and the lot of the poor and God,
                    too, their Keeper and their Shade upon their right hand. You see, it always
                    strikes me and it is remarkable, when we see the image of unutterable and
                    indescribable forsakenness — of loneliness — of poverty and misery, the end of
                    things or their extremity — the thought of God comes to mind. At least this is
                    the case with me, and doesn’t Pa also say: There is no place I would rather
                    speak than a cemetery, for there we are all on equal ground — there we not only
                    stand on equal ground but there we also feel that we are standing on equal
                    ground, and elsewhere we don’t always feel that. </p>
                <p> I’m glad that we saw the museum together, especially the works by Degroux and
                    Leys and so many other remarkable paintings, such as that landscape by
                    Coosemans, among others. <good_health>I’m very happy about the two prints you
                        gave me,</good_health> but you should have let me give you that small
                    etching, The three mills. Now you’ve paid it all yourself, not just half of it
                    as I had so wished — you must keep it in your scrapbook, however, because it’s
                    remarkable, even though it isn’t very well executed. In my ignorance I’d think
                    it attributable to Peasant Bruegel rather than to Velvet Brueghel. I hereby
                    enclose that scratch, ‘The Au charbonnage café’. I should really rather like to
                    start making rough sketches of some of the many things one meets along the way,
                    but considering I wouldn’t actually do it very well and it would most likely
                    keep me from my real work, it’s better I don’t begin. <work origin="new"
                        stage="middle">As soon as I got home I began working on a sermon on ‘the
                        barren fig tree’, Luke XIII:69.</work>I sincerely hope that you’ll have had
                    good days at home, that you also will have stayed over Sunday and found things
                    well at Princenhage. </p>
                <p> When you arrive home in The Hague write a quick note if you can find the time,
                    and be sure to give my warm regards to the Rooses. That little drawing, ‘The Au
                    charbonnage café’ is really nothing special, but the reason I couldn’t help
                    making it is because one sees so many coalmen, and they really are a remarkable
                    people. This little house is not far from Trekweg, it’s actually a simple inn
                    right next to the big workplace where the workers come in their free time to eat
                    their bread and drink a glass of beer. Back during my time in England I applied
                    for a position as an evangelist among the coalminers, but they brushed my
                    request aside and said I had to be at least 25 years old. You surely know that
                    one of the root or fundamental truths, not only of the gospel but of the entire
                    Bible, is ‘the light that dawns in the darkness’. From darkness to Light. Well
                    then, who will most certainly need it, who will have an ear to hear it?
                    Experience has taught us that those who work in darkness, in the heart of the
                    earth like the mineworkers in the black coalmines, among others, are very moved
                    by the message of the gospel and also believe it. In the south of Belgium, in
                    Hainaut, from around the area of Mons to the French borders and even extending
                    far beyond them, there is a region called the Borinage, where there is one of
                    those populations of labourers who work in the many coalmines. I found this and
                    other things about them in a geography book: The Borins (people who live in the
                    Borinage, an area west of Mons) do nothing but mine coal. They’re an impressive
                    sight, these coalmines, opened up 300 metres underground, down which a working
                    population worthy of our respect and sympathy descends every day. The coalminer
                    is a type peculiar to the Borinage; daylight hardly exists for him, and he
                    scarcely enjoys the sun’s rays except on Sunday. He works with great difficulty
                    by the light of a lamp whose illumination is pale and feeble, in a narrow
                    gallery, his body bent double, and sometimes forced to crawl; his work is to
                    pull from the earth’s entrails this mineral substance whose great usefulness we
                    know, he thus works in the midst of a thousand constantly recurring dangers, but
                    the Belgian foreman has a cheerful character, he’s used to this way of life, and
                    when he goes down the pit, his hat topped with a little lamp whose job is to
                    guide him in the darkness, he entrusts himself to his God Who sees his labours
                    and Who protects him, his wife and his children. His clothing consists of a hat
                    of boiled leather, a jacket and a pair of canvas trousers. So the Borinage lies
                    to the south of Lessines, where one finds the stonequarries. </p>
                <p> I should like to go there as an evangelist. The threemonth trial period set by
                    Messrs De Jonge and the Rev. Pieterszen is nearly over. Paul spent three years
                    in Arabia before he became active as a preacher and began his great missionary
                    journeys and his actual work among the heathens. If I could spend three years or
                    so in a similar region, working in peace and always learning and observing, then
                    I wouldn’t return from there without having something to say that is indeed
                    worth hearing; I say this in all humility yet with frankness. If God wills it
                    and spares my life, I’d be ready by about the age of 30 and could begin, with my
                    special training and experience, having more mastery of my affairs and more
                    maturity for the work than I do now. I’m writing this to you again, even though
                    we’ve already talked about it. There are already a number of small Protestant
                    congregations in the Borinage, and certainly schools as well, may God point me
                    to a place where I can be active as an evangelist in the way we spoke about, by
                    preaching the gospel to the poor, thus to those who have need of it and for whom
                    it is suited to perfection, and devoting my time during the week to
                    teaching.You’ve no doubt been to SaintGilles. I once took a walk from there to
                    the ‘old boundary mark’. Where the road to Mont Saint Jean begins there’s
                    another hill, the Alsemberg. Here, on the right, is the cemetery of SaintGilles,
                    full of cedars and ivy, from which one can look out over the city. Further on
                    one comes to Forest. The region is very picturesque there, standing on the high
                    slopes are old houses like the huts in the dunes that Bosboom painted. One sees
                    people doing all kinds of farm work, sowing wheat, lifting potatoes, washing
                    turnips, and everything, right down to woodgathering, is picturesque and looks
                    very much like Montmartre. </p>
                <p> There are old houses with ivy or Virginia creeper and charming inns, among the
                    houses I noticed was that of a mustardmaker, one Verkissen. His place would be
                    perfect for a painting by Thijs Maris, for example. There are places here and
                    there where stones are found and therefore small quarries to which sunken roads
                    with the deep ruts of cart tracks lead, where one sees small white horses with
                    red tassels and drivers with blue smocks, and the shepherd is not lacking, nor
                    old women in black with white caps reminiscent of those by Degroux. There are
                    also places here — as there are everywhere, for that matter, thank God — where
                    one feels at home more than elsewhere, where one gets a remarkable, familiar
                    feeling like homesickness, which has something bitterly melancholy about it but
                    which nevertheless strengthens and awakens the spirit in us and gives us new
                    strength and appetite for work and stimulates us, we know not how or why. That
                    day I walked on, past Forest, and took a side road to an old church overgrown
                    with ivy. I saw many lime trees, even more entwined with one another and even
                    more Gothic, so to speak, than those we saw in the park, and at the side of the
                    sunken road leading to the cemetery twisted bushes and the roots of trees, as
                    gnarled as those Dürer etched in ‘Knight, Death and the Devil’. Have you ever
                    seen a painting, or rather a photo of it, by Carlo Dolci, The Garden of Olives?
                    There’s something Rembrandtesque about it, saw it recently. You no doubt know
                    the large, rough etching of the same subject after Rembrandt, being the pendant
                    of the other, Reading the Bible, with those two women and the cradle. It came to
                    mind after you told me that you had seen the painting by père Corot of the same
                    subject; I saw it at the exhibition of his work shortly after he died, and it
                    moved me deeply. </p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="love">How much there is in art that is beautiful, if only one
                        can remember what one has seen, one is never empty or truly lonely, and

                <p> Adieu Theo, I shake your hand right heartily in thought, I wish you well, may
                    you thrive in your work and encounter many good things on your path in life,

                    for his letter of some time ago. If you go to Mauve’s, give him my regards, and

                <p> I kept this letter for a couple of days. 15 Nov. has passed, so the three months
                    are up. Spoke with the Rev. De Jonge and with Master Bokma, they say there is no
                    opportunity to be at the school under the same conditions they offer to native
                    Flemings — I can attend the lessons, for free if necessary — but this is the
                    only privilege — in order to stay, therefore, I would need to have more
                    financial means at my disposal than I do now, which is none. So I’ll probably
                    soon try the Borinage plan. Once out of the city I shan’t easily return to a big
                    city. It wouldn’t be easy to live without believing in Him and without having
                    the faith of old in Him, and without that one would lose heart.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p> It’s time I write to you again, first of all to wish you happiness at the
                    beginning of a new year. May much good be your share, and God’s blessing be on
                    your work in this year that we’re beginning. </p>
                <p> I’m eagerly longing for a letter from you, to hear again how things are going
                    and how you are, also perhaps to hear if you have recently seen anything
                    beautiful or remarkable. </p>
                <p> As far as I’m concerned, you surely understand that there are no paintings here
                    in the Borinage, that in general they haven’t the slightest idea of what a
                    painting is, so it goes without saying that I’ve seen absolutely nothing in the
                    way of art since my departure from Brussels. But this doesn’t mean that this
                    isn’t a very special and very picturesque country, everything speaks, as it
                    were, and is full of character. There was snow these last few days, the dark
                    days before Christmas. Then everything was reminiscent of the medieval paintings
                    by Peasant Bruegel, among others, and by so many others who were so good at
                    expressing the singular effect of red and green, black and white. Time and
                    again, what one sees here reminds one of the work of Thijs Maris or Albrecht
                    Dürer, for example. </p>
                <p> There are sunken roads here, overgrown with thornbushes and with old, twisted
                    trees with their gnarled roots, which look exactly like that road in the etching
                    by Dürer, The knight and Death. </p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="environment">These last few days, for instance, it was an
                        extraordinary sight, with the white snow in the evening around the twilight
                        hour, seeing the workers returning home from the mines. </unstress>These
                    people are completely black when they come out of the dark mines into the
                    daylight again, they look just like chimneysweeps. Their houses are usually
                    small and could better be called huts, scattered along the sunken roads and in
                    the wood and against the slopes of the hills. One sees mosscovered roofs here
                    and there, and the light shines kindly in the evening through the smallpaned
                    windows.Just as in Brabant we have the copse and the oak wood, and in Holland
                    the pollard willows, so here one sees those black thornbushes around the
                    gardens, fields and land. The recent snow gave it the effect of letters written
                    on white paper, like the pages of the gospel. </p>
                <p> I’ve already spoken here at various times, both in a fairly large room,
                    specially furnished for religious meetings, and in the gatherings that are
                    customarily held in the workers’ houses in the evenings, which one can best call
                    Biblereading. Spoke, among other things, on: the parable of the mustard seed,
                    the barren fig tree, the man who was blind from his birth. On Christmas, of
                    course, on the stable of Bethlehem, and Peace on earth. </p>
                <p> May it come to pass with God’s blessing that I be placed here permanently
                    somewhere; I should sincerely wish it. </p>
                <p> Everywhere around here one sees the big chimneys and the huge mountains of coal
                    at the entrance to the mines, the socalled coalpits. You know that large drawing
                    by Bosboom, Chaudfontaine, it conveys the character of the land here well, only
                    here everything is coal, in the north of Hainaut stonequarries, and
                    Chaudfontaine more iron ore. </p>
                <p> I still think so often of that day when you were in Brussels and of our visit to
                    the Museum. And I often wish that you were a bit closer and we could be together
                    more often. Do write again soon. Again and again I look at that etching of A
                    young citizen. The mineworkers’ language is not all that easy to understand, but
                    they understand normal French well if one can speak it rapidly and fluently,
                    then it naturally resembles their dialect, which is spoken amazingly fast. At a
                    gathering this week I spoke on the text Acts XVI:9 ‘And a vision appeared to
                    Paul in the night; There stood a man of Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come
                    over into Macedonia, and help us.’ And they listened attentively when I tried to
                    describe what that Macedonian was like who needed and longed for the comfort of
                    the gospel and the knowledge of the Only True God. How we should imagine him as
                    a worker with signs of sorrow and suffering and fatigue on his face, without
                    form or glory but with an immortal soul that has need of the meat which endureth
                    unto everlasting life, namely the Word of God, for man cannot live by bread
                    alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. </p>
                <p> How Jesus Christ is the Master who can strengthen, comfort and enlighten a man
                    like the Macedonian, a workman and labourer who has a hard life. Because He
                    himself is the great Man of Sorrows, who knows our diseases, who himself is
                    called the carpenter’s son, even though He was the Son of God and the great
                    physician of sick souls. Who worked for 30 years in a humble carpenter’s
                    workshop to carry out God’s will; and God wants man to live and walk humbly upon
                    the earth, in imitation of Christ, minding not high things, but condescending to
                    men of low estate, learning from the gospel to be meek and lowly in heart. </p>
                <p> I’ve already had the opportunity to visit a few sick people, for many people
                    here are ill. Wrote today to the president of the Comité d’Evangelisation to
                    request that my case be brought before the next meeting of the committee. </p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="environment">It thawed last night, I cannot tell you how
                        picturesque the hilly countryside looks in the thaw, now that the snow is
                        melting and the black fields with the green of the winter wheat are again
                        becoming visible.</unstress> For foreigners the villages here are truly a
                    maze, with countless narrow streets and alleyways with the small houses of the
                    workers, at the foot of the hills as well as on their slopes and at the top. It
                    can best be compared to a village like Scheveningen, especially the poor
                    quarters, or to those villages in Brittany that we know from paintings. For that
                    matter, you rode through this region yourself on the railway journey to and from
                    Paris, and maybe remember it a little. The Protestant churches are small,
                    similar to the one in Hoeven, but slightly larger, but where I spoke was only a
                    simple, large room that can hold a hundred people if necessary. I also attended
                    a service in a stable or barn, so it’s quite simple and novel. </p>
                <p> Write soon when you have the time, and remember that you are repeatedly, even
                    constantly, in my thoughts. Wishing again that God’s best blessings may be your
                    share in the new year, and shaking your hand in thought, believe me ever </p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p> I heard from Pa and Ma that they were recently surprised by a visit from you,
                    just when Pa had returned from here. <good_health>I’m very glad that Pa was
                        here.</good_health> Together we visited the 3 ministers of the Borinage and
                    walked through the snow and visited a miner’s family and saw coal being hauled
                    up from a mine called Les trois Diefs (the three heaps of earth) and Pa attended
                    two Bible readings, so we did a great deal in those couple of days. I believe
                    that Pa received an impression of the Borinage that he won’t easily forget, as
                    it would be with anyone who visited this singular, remarkable and picturesque
                    region of the country. </p>
                <p> It’s been a long time since I wrote to you. If, with God’s blessing, I succeed
                    in getting settled here, then you must come here sometime, perhaps when you have
                    to go to Paris again, or tying it in with a business trip. </p>
                <p> I recently found in the house of an elderly man who had worked in the mines for
                    many years a list of all the seams of coal south of Mons, which are 155 in
                    number. The country and the people here appeal to me more each day, one has here
                    a familiar feeling as though on the heath or in the dunes, there’s something
                    simple and kindhearted about the people. Those who have left here are homesick
                    for their country, just as, conversely, foreigners who are homesick may come to
                    feel at home here.How are Mauve and Maris? Have you seen a lot lately? The
                    spring that is beginning will renew and change their subject matter. What did
                    Israëls make this winter? How much they would notice here that would make an
                    impression on them! When the cart with a white horse (l’blanc ch’val) brings an
                    injured man home from the mine, one sees things that remind one of Israëls’s
                    shipwreck, and over and over again there is something that moves one. </p>
                <p> Write a few words soon, and remember that if you tell me about the painters, I
                    still understand something of it, even though it’s been a long time since I’ve
                    seen many paintings. </p>
                <p>
                    <good_health>Have rented a small house where I’d really like to live entirely on
                        my own, but which now serves only as a workplace or study, because Pa thinks
                        it better that I board with Denis, and I do too. I have prints on the wall
                        there and all sorts of things.</good_health>
                </p>
                <p> I have to go out and visit the sick as well as the healthy. Write soon, and I
                    wish you the very best. </p>
                <p> Give my regards to Mauve, if you see him, and to your housemates. </p>
                <p> Spring is beginning, for one hears larks here, and in the woods the branches and
                    buds are beginning to sprout, especially the alders, but when Pa was here
                    everything was covered with snow, so that Pa saw the singular effect of the
                    black coalpits and the many black chimneys in the snow. There are many places
                    here that remind one of that drawing by Bosboom, Chaudfontaine. </p>
                <p>Adieu, a handshake in thought, and believe me ever</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p> It’s time that you hear something from me again. I heard from home that you were
                    in Etten for a couple of days and that you were travelling for the firm. I
                    sincerely hope that your trip went well. </p>
                <p> These days you’ll no doubt be in the dunes and in Scheveningen now and then.
                        <unstress reason="environment">Here it’s also attractive in the country in
                        the spring; here and there are places where one could imagine oneself in the
                        dunes, because of the hills.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p> I went on a very interesting excursion not long ago; the fact is, I spent 6
                    hours in a mine. </p>
                <p> In one of the oldest and most dangerous mines in the area no less, called
                    Marcasse. This mine has a bad name because many die in it, whether going down or
                    coming up, or by suffocation or gas exploding, or because of water in the
                    ground, or because of old passageways caving in and so on. It’s a sombre place,
                    and at first sight everything around it has something dismal and deathly about
                    it. The workers there are usually people, emaciated and pale owing to fever, who
                    look exhausted and haggard, weatherbeaten and prematurely old, the women
                    generally sallow and withered. All around the mine are poor miners’ dwellings
                    with a couple of dead trees, completely black from the smoke, and thornhedges,
                    dungheaps and rubbish dumps, mountains of unusable coal. Maris would make a
                    beautiful painting of it. </p>
                <p>
                    <work origin="new" stage="planned">Later I’ll try and make a sketch of it to
                        give you an idea of it. </work>Had a good guide, a man who has already
                    worked there for 33 years, a friendly and patient man who explained everything
                    clearly and tried to make it understandable. </p>
                <p> We went down together, 700 metres deep this time, and went into the most hidden
                    corners of that underworld. </p>
                <p> The maintenages or gradins (cells where the miners work) that are farthest
                    removed from the exit are called ‘des caches’ (hidden places, places where one
                    searches). This mine has 5 levels, 3 of which, the uppermost ones, are exhausted
                    and abandoned, one no longer works in them because there’s no more coal. If
                    anyone were to try and make a painting of the maintenages, that would be
                    something new and something unheardof or rather neverbeforeseen. Imagine a
                    series of cells in a rather narrow and low passageway, supported by rough
                    timberwork. In each of the cells is a worker in a coarse linen suit, dingy and
                    soiled as a chimneysweep, chipping away at the coal by the dim light of a small
                    lamp. In some of the cells the worker stands upright, in others (‘seams worked
                    lying down’) he lies flat on the ground. </p>
                <p> The arrangement is more or less like the cells in a beehive, or like a dark,
                    sombre passageway in an underground prison, or like a series of small looms, or
                    actually they look like a row of ovens such as one sees among the peasants, or
                    like the separate tombs in a vault. The passageways themselves are like the
                    large chimneys of the Brabant farmsteads. </p>
                <p> In some, water leaks in everywhere and the light of the miner’s lamp creates a
                    peculiar effect and reflects as in a cave full of stalactites. Some of the
                    miners work in the maintenages, others load the loosened coal into small wagons
                    that are transported along rails resembling a tramway. It’s mostly children who
                    do this, both boys and girls. There’s also a stable there, 700 metres below
                    ground, with around 7 old horses that transport larger amounts, bringing them to
                    the socalled accrochage, that being the place where they’re hauled up. Other
                    workers are busy restoring the antiquated passageways to prevent them from
                    caving in, or are making new passageways in the coal seam. Just as sailors on
                    land are homesick for the sea, despite all the dangers and difficulties that
                    threaten them, so the mineworker would rather be below ground than above. </p>
                <p> The villages here have something forsaken and still and extinct about them,
                    because life goes on underground instead of above. One could be here for years,
                    but unless one has been down in the mines one has no clear picture of what goes
                    on here. </p>
                <p> The people here are very uneducated and ignorant, and most of them can’t read,
                    yet they’re shrewd and nimble in their difficult work, courageous, of rather
                    small build but squareshouldered, with sombre, deepset eyes. They’re skilled at
                    many things and work amazingly hard. Very nervous dispositions, I mean not weak
                    but sensitive. Have a festering and deeprooted hatred and an innate distrust of
                    anyone who tries to boss them around. With charcoalburners one must have a
                    charcoalburner’s nature and character, and no pretensions, pridefulness or
                    imperiousness, otherwise one can’t get on with them and could never win their
                    trust.Did I tell you at the time about the miner who was badly burned by a gas
                    explosion? Thank God he has now recovered and goes out and about and is
                    beginning to take long walks as practice, his hands are still weak and it will
                    be some time before he’s able to use them for his work, yet he has been saved.
                    But since then there have been quite a few cases of typhus and virulent fever,
                    including what is known as ‘foolish fever’, which causes one to have bad dreams
                    such as nightmares and delirium. So there are again many sickly and bedridden
                    people, lying emaciated on their beds, weak and miserable. </p>
                <p> In one house everyone is sick with fever, and they have little or no help, which
                    means that there the sick are taking care of the sick. ‘Here it is the sick who
                    nurse the sick,’ said the woman, just as it is the poor who befriend the poor. </p>
                <p> Have you seen anything beautiful recently? I’m eagerly longing for a letter from
                    you. </p>
                <p> Has Israëls been working a lot lately, and Maris and Mauve? </p>
                <p> A couple of nights ago a foal was born in the stable here, a nice small creature
                    that was quick to stand firmly on its feet. The workers keep a lot of goats
                    here, and there are young ones in the houses everywhere, just like the rabbits
                    commonly to be found in the workers’ houses. </p>
                <p> Must go out and visit the sick, so have to finish now, let me hear from you
                    soon, to give a sign of life, should you have the time. </p>
                <p> Give my regards to your housemates, and to Mauve when you get the chance, I wish
                    you the very best, and believe me ever, with a handshake in thought, </p>

                <p>Going down in a mine is an unpleasant business, in a kind of basket or cage like
                    a bucket in a well, but then a well 500700 metres deep, so that down there,
                    looking upward, the daylight appears to be about as big as a star in the sky.
                    One has a feeling similar to one’s first time on a ship at sea, but worse,
                    though fortunately it doesn’t last long. The workers get used to it, but even
                    so, they never shake off an unconquerable feeling of horror and dread that stays
                    with them, not without reason or unjustifiably. Once down there, however, it
                    isn’t so bad, and the effort is richly rewarded by what one sees.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p> It’s already rather late, i.e. nearly 12 o’clock, but I still want to write a
                    few words to you today. First of all, because it was such a long time ago that I
                    wrote to you — but old chap, what should I write to you? — <stress
                        reason="career">am swamped with all kinds of work here, so that the days
                        pass by, but often one doesn’t even have time to think or do things that
                        would otherwise appeal to one.</stress> But what particularly compels me to
                    write is what I heard from home, namely that they’ve offered to send you to
                    Paris for 6 weeks. If you go there, you’ll pass by the Borinage. Wouldn’t you
                    consider spending a day here, or longer if possible? I’d so much like you to
                    know this country, because there’s so very much that’s unique to be noticed by
                    those who look at things closely. Wouldn’t it be remarkable for someone who had
                    never seen a seaside village to see Scheveningen or Katwijk or some other
                    village? Well then — there’s no sea here, but the character of all things is
                    interesting and worth getting to know. So should you feel the desire and are so
                    inclined, and can find the time and opportunity, please stop over here, but
                    write ahead of time when you’re coming and whereabouts I can find you, at which
                    station and on which train. </p>
                <p> I’ll give this letter to Ma when she comes, because in all likelihood I’ll be
                    meeting her when she returns from Paris. Am eagerly longing to see her. </p>
                <p> Fortunately for Uncle, the danger seems to have been averted for the time being. </p>
                <p> What affected me deeply was hearing that Frans Soek died, I’d like to hear some
                    particulars in the matter from you, if you happen to know anything, poor chap,
                    life wasn’t easy for him, but rather quite a struggle. </p>
                <p> We had a terrible storm here a couple of days ago, around 11 o’clock in the
                    evening. There’s a place nearby where one can see in the distance, below, a
                    large part of the Borinage, with the chimneys, mountains of coal, small workers’
                    houses, small black figures moving about during the day as though in an ants’
                    nest, in the far distance dark fir woods with small white workers’ houses in
                    front of them, a couple of little towers in the distance, an old mill. Usually a
                    sort of fog hangs over it, or else there’s the fanciful effect of light and
                    shade owing to the shadows of clouds that remind one of paintings by Rembrandt
                    or Michel or Ruisdael. But on the occasion of that storm in the pitchblack
                    night, it was a special effect caused by the flashes of lightning that made
                    everything visible just for a moment now and then. Nearby, the large, sombre
                    buildings of the Marcasse mine, standing alone and set apart on the flat field,
                    which that night, during the violent rains, truly reminded one of the hulk of
                    Noah’s ark, as it would have appeared in the darkness of the Flood by the light
                    of a lightning flash. Inspired by the impression made by that storm, I included
                    a description of a shipwreck in the Bible reading this evening. </p>
                <p> Am currently reading Uncle Tom’s cabin a lot — there’s still so much slavery in
                    the world — and in that astonishingly beautiful book this extremely momentous
                    matter is treated with such wisdom, with a love and a zeal and interest in the
                    genuine welfare of the poor and oppressed, that one can’t help coming back to it
                    again and again and finding more in it each time. </p>
                <p> I know no better definition of the word Art than this, ‘Art is man added to
                    nature’, nature, reality, truth, but with a meaning, with an interpretation,
                    with a character that the artist brings out and to which he gives expression,
                    which he sets free, which he unravels, releases, elucidates. </p>
                <p> A painting by Mauve or Maris or Israëls speaks more and more clearly than nature
                    itself. So it is with books as well, and in Uncle Tom’s cabin in particular,
                    things have been put in a new light by the artist, and thus in that book, even
                    though it’s already beginning to be an old book, i.e. one written years ago, all
                    things are made new. It’s so subtly felt, it’s so well worked out, it’s so
                    masterly. It was written with so much love, so much seriousness and so faithful
                    to the truth and with knowledge of the subject. It’s so humble and simple but at
                    the same time so truly sublime, so noble and so distinguished. </p>
                <p> Recently read a book about the English coalmining district, but it didn’t give
                    very many details. Herewith a woodcut for your scrapbook. </p>
                <p> Lately made the acquaintance of someone who supervised the workers for years. Is
                    of humble origins but worked his way up. Now he has a chest complaint, quite
                    serious, and can no longer stand the terribly exhausting work down in the mine.
                    It’s very important to hear him talk about the subject. He has always remained
                    the workmen’s friend (in contrast to many others who worked their way up, not
                    because of true distinction but because of money, driven by motives less noble
                    and many times more base). He has a labourer’s heart, true and honest and
                    courageous, but is far above most of them as regards intellectual development. </p>
                <p> On more than one occasion during a strike, he was the only person who could
                    exert any influence on the workers. </p>
                <p> They would hear no one, they would listen to no one but him, and at the critical
                    moment no one was obeyed but him alone. When I met him for the first time, I
                    thought of the etching after Meissonier, with which you are familiar, The
                    reader. One of Denis’s boys is as good as engaged to his daughter, which is why
                    he comes here to the house, though but seldom, and I made his acquaintance.
                    Since then I’ve visited him a few times. </p>
                <p> Have you ever read Legouvé’s Les pères et les enfants, that’s a remarkable book,
                    found it there in the house and read it with interest. </p>
                <p> Received a letter a few days ago from the Rev. Jones of Isleworth in which he
                    writes about the building of wooden churches here in the Borinage. Is it
                    feasible? Is it desirable? He has a mind to work towards that goal, i.e.
                    erecting the first of such buildings. </p>
                <p> Even talks about coming over here sometime in the autumn to discuss the matter. </p>
                <p> I truly wish that such a thing may come to pass. </p>
                <p> Write a few words if you have time, and if you can, stop here on your way to
                    Paris. In any event, let me know if possible on which train you’ll be passing
                    through one of the railway stations in the vicinity of Wasmes, and which
                    station, because I’ll do my best to be there. </p>
                <p>Blessings on your work, and believe me ever</p>

            <body>
                <p> I’m writing to you in haste. Won’t you be going to Paris quite soon now? If so,
                    write and tell me which day and what time, and in all likelihood I’ll see you at
                    the station. If you have time to stay here for a day, or longer or shorter, I
                    sincerely wish that this could happen. </p>
                <p> Would be able to show you some drawings, types from here, not that they alone
                    make it worth your while to get off the train, but <unstress

                        you in the scenery and in the singularity of everything, for there’s so much

                    read Dickens, ‘Les temps difficiles’, I’m giving you the title in French because

                    Bibliothèque des meilleurs romans étranger. It’s masterly, one of the characters
                    is a worker, Stephen Blackpool, who’s well portrayed and extremely likeable. </p>

                <location>Cuesmes</location>, between about Monday, 11 and Thursday, <date>14 August
                    1879</date>.</head>
            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p> It’s mainly to tell you that I’m grateful for your visit that I’m writing to
                    you. It was quite a long time ago that we saw each other or wrote to each other
                    as we used to. All the same, it’s better that we feel something for each other
                    rather than behave like corpses towards one another, the more so because as long
                    as one has no real right to be called a corpse by being legally dead, it smacks
                    of hypocrisy or at least childishness to pose as such. Childish in the manner of
                    a young man of 14 years who thinks that his dignity and social standing actually
                    oblige him to wear a top hat. The hours we spent together in this way have at
                    least assured us that we’re both still in the land of the living.
                        <bad_health>When I saw you again and took a walk with you, I had the same
                        feeling I used to have more than I do now, as though life were something
                        good and precious that one should cherish, and I felt more cheerful and
                        alive than I had been for a long time, because in spite of myself life has
                        gradually become or has seemed much less precious to me, much more
                        unimportant and indifferent.</bad_health>
                    <bad_health>When one lives with others and is bound by a feeling of affection
                        one is aware that one has a reason for being, that one might not be entirely
                        worthless and superfluous but perhaps good for one thing or another,
                        considering that we need one another and are making the same journey as
                        travelling companions.</bad_health> Proper selfrespect, however, is also
                    very dependent on relations with others. </p>
                <p> A prisoner who’s kept in isolation, who’s prevented from working, would in the
                    long run, especially if this were to last too long, suffer the consequences just
                    as surely as one who went hungry for too long. Like everyone else, <stress
                        reason="friendship">I have need of relationships of friendship or affection
                        or trusting companionship, and am not like a street pump or lamppost,
                        whether of stone or iron, so that I can’t do without them without perceiving
                        an emptiness and feeling their lack,</stress> like any other generally
                    civilized and highly respectable man — and I tell you these things to let you
                    know what a salutary effect your visit had on me. </p>
                <p> And just as I wished that we not drift apart, this is also the case with regard
                    to those at home. Even so, at the moment I really dread going there and am
                    strongly inclined to stay here. It could, however, be my fault, and you could be
                    right in thinking that I don’t see things straight, which is why it may be that,
                    despite my great reluctance and notwithstanding that it’s a hard journey, I’m
                    going to Etten for at least a few days. </p>
                <p> As I think back on your visit with thankfulness, our talks naturally come to
                    mind. I’ve heard such talks before, many, in fact, and often. Plans for
                    improvement and change and raising the spirits — and yet, don’t let it anger
                    you, I’m a little afraid of them — also because I sometimes acted upon them and
                    ended up rather disappointed. How much has been well thought out that is,
                    however, impracticable. </p>
                <p> The time spent at Amsterdam is still so fresh in my memory. You were there
                    yourself, and so you know how the pros and cons were weighed, considered and
                    deliberated upon, reasoned with wisdom, how it was well meant — and yet how
                    pitiful the result, how daft the whole business, how grossly stupid. I still
                    shudder at the thought. It was the worst time I’ve ever gone through. How
                    desirable and appealing the rather difficult and troubled days here in this poor
                    country, in these primitive surroundings, seem to me compared with then.
                    Something similar, I fear, will be the result of following wise counsel given
                    with the best of intentions. </p>
                <p> For such experiences are pretty drastic for me. The damage, the sorrow, the
                    heart’s regretfulness is too great for both of us not to have learned the hard
                    way. If we don’t learn from this, what shall we then learn from? A striving such
                    as reaching the goal set before me, as it was put then, truly that is an
                    ambition that won’t easily take hold of me again, the desire to achieve it has
                    cooled considerably, and I now look at things from a different perspective, even
                    though it may sound and look attractive, and even though it’s unacceptable to
                    think about it as experience taught me to think about it. Unacceptable, yes,
                    just as, for example, Francq the Evangelist finds it unacceptable that I
                    declared the sermons given by the Rev. Jean Andry to be only slightly more
                    evangelical than the sermons of a priest. I would rather die a natural death
                    than be prepared for it by the academy, and have occasionally had a lesson from
                    a grassmower that seemed to me more useful than one in Greek. </p>
                <p> I<bad_health>mprovement in my life — should I not desire it or should I not be
                        in need of improvement? I really want to improve. But it’s precisely because
                        I yearn for it that I’m afraid of remedies that are worse than the disease.
                        Can you blame a sick person if he looks the doctor straight in the eye and
                        prefers not to be treated wrongly or by a quack?</bad_health>
                </p>
                <p> Does someone who has consumption or typhus do wrong by maintaining that a
                    stronger remedy than barley water might be useful or even necessary, or, finding
                    that barley water in itself can do no harm, nevertheless doubts its efficacy and
                    potency in his particular case? </p>
                <p> The doctor who prescribed barley water mustn’t say, this patient is a stubborn
                    person who is set upon his own ruin because he doesn’t want to take medicine —
                    no, because the man is not unwilling, but the socalled medicine was unsuitable,
                    because it was indeed ‘it’ but still not yet ‘it’ at all. </p>
                <p> Do you blame someone if he fails to be moved by a painting which is recorded in
                    the catalogue as a Memling but which has nothing to do with Memling other than
                    that it’s a similar subject from the Gothic period but without artistic value? </p>
                <p> And if you should now assume from what I’ve said that I intended to say you were
                    a quack because of your advice then you will have completely misunderstood me,
                    since I have no such idea or opinion of you. </p>
                <p> If, on the other hand, you think that I thought I would do well to take your
                    advice literally and become a lithographer of invoice headings and visiting
                    cards, or a bookkeeper or a carpenter’s apprentice — likewise that of my very
                    dear sister Anna to devote myself to the baker’s trade or many other things of
                    that kind (quite remarkably diverse and mutually exclusive) — which it was
                    suggested I pursue, you would also be mistaken. But, you say, I’m not giving you
                    this advice for you to follow to the letter, but because I thought you had a
                    taste for idling and because I was of the opinion that you should put an end to
                    it. </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="friendship">Might I be allowed to point out to you that such
                        idling is really a rather strange sort of idling. It’s rather difficult for
                        me to defend myself on this score, but I would be sorry if you couldn’t
                        eventually see this in a different light. I also don’t know if I would do
                        well to counter such accusations by following the advice to become a baker,
                        for example. That would really be a sufficient answer (supposing it were
                        possible for us to assume the guise of a baker or haircutter or librarian
                        with lightning speed) and yet actually a foolish response, rather like the
                        way the man acted who, when accused of heartlessness because he was sitting
                        on a donkey, immediately dismounted and continued on his way with the donkey
                        on his shoulders</stress>. </p>
                <p> And, joking apart, I honestly think it would be better if the relationship
                    between us were more trusting on both sides. <stress reason="friendship">If I
                        must seriously feel that I’m annoying or burdensome to you or those at home,
                        useful for neither one thing nor another, and were to go on being forced to
                        feel like an intruder or a fifth wheel in your presence, so that it would be
                        better I weren’t there, and if I should have to continue trying to keep
                        further and further out of other people’s way</stress> — <bad_health>if I
                        think that indeed it would be so and cannot be otherwise, then I’m overcome
                        by a feeling of sorrow and I must struggle against despair. </bad_health>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <bad_health>It’s difficult for me to bear these thoughts and more difficult
                        still to bear the thought that so much discord, misery and sorrow, in our
                        midst and in our family, has been caused by me.</bad_health>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <bad_health>If it were indeed so, then I’d truly wish that it be granted me not
                        to have to go on living too long. </bad_health>Yet whenever this depresses
                    me beyond measure, all too deeply, after a long time the thought also occurs to
                    me: <bad_health>it’s perhaps only a bad, terrible dream, and later we’ll perhaps
                        learn to understand and comprehend it better.</bad_health> But is it not,
                    after all, reality, and won’t it one day become better rather than worse? To
                    many it would no doubt appear foolish and superstitious to believe in any
                    improvement for the better. Sometimes in winter it’s so bitterly cold that one
                    says, it’s simply too cold, what do I care whether summer comes, the bad
                    outweighs the good. <bad_health>But whether we like it or not, an end finally
                        comes to the hard frost, and one fine morning the wind has turned and we
                        have a thaw. Comparing the natural state of the weather with our state of
                        mind and our circumstances, subject to variableness and change, I still have
                        some hope that it can improve</bad_health>. </p>

                    <bad_health>If you write, soon perhaps, you will make me happy.</bad_health>

            <salutation>My dear Theo, </salutation>
            <body>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="family">It’s with some reluctance that I write to you</stress>,
                    not having done so for so long, and that for many a reason. Up to a certain
                    point you’ve become a stranger to me, and I too am one to you, perhaps more than
                    you think; perhaps it would be better for us not to go on this way. It’s
                    possible that I wouldn’t even have written to you now if it weren’t that I’m
                    under the obligation, the necessity, of writing to you. If, I say, you yourself
                    hadn’t imposed that necessity. I learned at Etten that you had sent fifty francs
                    for me; well, I accepted them. Certainly reluctantly, certainly with a <stress
                        reason="family">rather melancholy feeling</stress>, but I’m in some sort of
                    impasse or mess; what else can one do? And so it’s to thank you for it that I’m
                    writing to you.</p>
                <p>As you may perhaps know, I’m back in the Borinage; my father spoke to me of
                    staying in the vicinity of Etten instead; I said no, and I believe I acted thus
                    for the best. Without wishing to, I’ve more or less become some sort of
                    impossible and suspect character in the family, in any event, somebody who isn’t
                    trusted, so how, then, could I be useful to anybody in any way? That’s why,
                    first of all, so I’m inclined to believe, it is beneficial and the best and most
                    reasonable position to take, for me to go away and to remain at a proper
                    distance, as if I didn’t exist. What moulting is to birds, the time when they
                    change their feathers, that’s adversity or misfortune, hard times, for us human
                    beings. One may remain in this period of moulting, one may also come out of it
                    renewed, but it’s not to be done in public, however; <bad_health>it’s scarcely
                        entertaining, it’s not cheerful, so it’s a matter of making oneself
                        scarce</bad_health>. Well, so be it. Now, although it may be a thing of
                    rather demoralizing difficulty to regain the trust of an entire family perhaps
                    not entirely devoid of prejudices and other similarly honourable and fashionable
                    qualities, nevertheless, I’m not utterly without hope that little by little,
                    slowly and surely, a good understanding may be re-established with this person
                    and that. In the first place, then, I’d like to see this good understanding, to
                    say no more, re-established between my father and me, and I would also be very
                    keen that it be re-established between the two of us. Good understanding is
                    infinitely better than misunderstanding. I must now bore you with certain
                    abstract things; however, I’d like you to listen to them patiently.</p>
                <p>I, for one, am a man of passions, capable of and liable to do rather foolish
                    things for which I sometimes feel rather sorry. I do often find myself speaking
                    or acting somewhat too quickly when it would be better to wait more patiently. I
                    think that other people may also sometimes do similar foolish things. Now that
                    being so, what’s to be done, must one consider oneself a dangerous man,
                    incapable of anything at all? I don’t think so. But it’s a matter of trying by
                    every means to turn even these passions to good account. For example, to name
                    one passion among others, I have a more or less irresistible passion for books,
                    and I have a need continually to educate myself, to study, if you like,
                    precisely as I need to eat my bread. You’ll be able to understand that yourself.
                    When I was in different surroundings, in surroundings of paintings and works of
                    art, you well know that I then took a violent passion for those surroundings
                    that went as far as enthusiasm. And I don’t repent it, and now, far from the
                    country again, I often feel homesick for the country of paintings. </p>
                <p>You may perhaps clearly remember that I knew very well (and it may well be that I
                    still know) what Rembrandt was or what Millet was, or Jules Dupré or Delacroix
                    or Millais or M. Maris. Good — now I no longer have those surroundings —
                    however, that something that’s called soul, they claim that it never dies and
                    that it lives for ever and seeks for ever and for ever and for evermore. So
                    instead of succumbing to homesickness, I said to myself, one’s country or native
                    land is everywhere. So instead of giving way to despair, I took the way of
                    active melancholy as long as I had strength for activity, or in other words, I
                    preferred the melancholy that hopes and aspires and searches to the one that
                    despairs, mournful and stagnant. So I studied the books I had to hand rather
                    seriously, such as the Bible and Michelet’s La révolution Française, and then
                    last winter, Shakespeare and a little V. Hugo and Dickens and Beecher Stowe, and
                    then recently Aeschylus, and then several other less classic authors, several
                    good minor masters. You well know that one who is ranked among the minor (?)
                    masters is called Fabritius or Bida. Now the man who is absorbed in all that is
                    sometimes shocking, to others, and without wishing to, offends to a greater or
                    lesser degree against certain forms and customs and social conventions. It’s a
                    pity, though, when people take that in bad part. For example, you well know that
                    I’ve frequently neglected my appearance, I admit it, and I admit that it’s
                    shocking. But look, <stress reason="money">money troubles and poverty have
                        something to do with it</stress>, and then <stress reason="environment">a
                        profound discouragement also has something to do with it</stress>, and then
                    it’s sometimes a good means of ensuring for oneself the solitude needed to be
                    able to go somewhat more deeply into this or that field of study with which one
                    is preoccupied. One very necessary field of study is medicine; there’s hardly a
                    man who doesn’t try to know a little bit about it, who doesn’t try to understand
                    at least what it’s about, and here I still don’t know anything at all about it.
                    But all of that absorbs you, but all of that preoccupies you, but all of that
                    makes you dream, ponder, think. And now for as much as 5 years, perhaps, I don’t
                    know exactly, I’ve been more or less without a position, wandering hither and
                    thither. Now you say, from such and such a time you’ve been going downhill,
                    you’ve faded away, you’ve done nothing. Is that entirely true? It’s true that
                    sometimes I’ve earned my crust of bread, sometimes some friend has given me it
                    as a favour; I’ve lived as best I could, better or worse, as things went; it’s
                    true that <stress reason="friendship">I’ve lost several people’s trust</stress>,
                    it’s true that my <stress reason="money">financial affairs are in a sorry
                        state</stress>, it’s true that the future’s not a little dark, it’s true
                    that I could have done better, it’s true that just in terms of earning my living
                    I’ve lost time, it’s true that my studies themselves are in a rather sorry and
                    disheartening state, and that I lack more, infinitely more than I have. But is
                    that called going downhill, and is that called doing nothing? Perhaps you’ll
                    say, but why didn’t you continue as people would have wished you to continue,
                    along the university road? </p>
                <p>To that I’d say only this, it costs too much and then, <stress
                        reason="environment">that future was no better than the present
                    one</stress>, on the road that I’m on. <bad_health>But on the road that I’m on I
                        must continue; if I do nothing, if I don’t study, if I don’t keep on trying,
                        then I’m lost, then woe betide me.</bad_health> That’s how I see this, to
                    keep on, keep on, that’s what’s needed. But what’s your ultimate goal, you’ll
                    say. That goal will become clearer, will take shape slowly and surely, as the
                    croquis becomes a sketch and the sketch a painting, as one works more seriously,
                    as one digs deeper into the originally vague idea, the first fugitive, passing
                    thought, unless it becomes firm. You must know that it’s the same with
                    evangelists as with artists. There’s an old, often detestable, tyrannical
                    academic school, the abomination of desolation, in fact — men having, so to
                    speak, a suit of armour, a steel breastplate of prejudices and conventions.
                    Those men, when they’re in charge of things, have positions at their disposal,
                    and by a system of circumlocution seek to support their protégés, and to exclude
                    the natural man from among them. Their God is like the God of Shakespeare’s
                    drunkard, Falstaff, ‘the inside of a church’; in truth, certain evangelical
                    (???) gentlemen find themselves, by a strange conjunction (perhaps they
                    themselves, if they were capable of human feeling, would be somewhat surprised)
                    find themselves holding the very same point of view as the drunkard in spiritual
                    matters. But there’s little fear that their blindness will ever turn into
                    clear-sightedness on the subject. This state of affairs has its bad side for
                    someone who doesn’t agree with all that, and who protests against it with all
                    his heart and with all his soul and with all the indignation of which he is
                    capable. Myself, I respect academicians who are not like those academicians, but
                    the respectable ones are more thinly scattered than one would believe at first
                    glance. <stress reason="career">Now one of the reasons why I’m now without a
                        position, why I’ve been without a position for years</stress>, it’s quite
                    simply because I have different ideas from these gentlemen who give positions to
                    individuals who think like them. It’s not a simple matter of appearance, as
                    people have hypocritically held it against me, it’s something more serious than
                    that, I assure you.</p>
                <p>Why am I telling you all this? — not to grumble, not to apologize for things in
                    which I may be more or less wrong, but quite simply to tell you this: on your
                    last visit, last summer, when we walked together near the disused mine they call
                    La Sorcière, you reminded me that there was a time when we also walked together
                    near the old canal and mill of Rijswijk, and then, you said, we were in
                    agreement on many things, but, you added — you’ve really changed since then,
                    you’re not the same any more. Well, that’s not quite how it is; what has changed
                    is that my life was less difficult then and my future less dark, but as far as
                    my inner self, as far as my way of seeing and thinking are concerned, they
                    haven’t changed. But if in fact there were a change, it’s that now I think and I
                    believe and I love more seriously what then, too, I already thought, I believed
                    and I loved. So it would be a misunderstanding if you were to persist in
                    believing that, for example, I would be less warm now towards Rembrandt or
                    Millet or Delacroix, or whomever or whatever, because it’s the opposite. But you
                    see, there are several things that are to be believed and to be loved; there’s
                    something of Rembrandt in Shakespeare and something of Correggio or Sarto in
                    Michelet, and something of Delacroix in V. Hugo, and in Beecher Stowe there’s
                    something of Ary Scheffer. And in Bunyan there’s something of M. Maris or of
                    Millet, a reality more real than reality, so to speak, but you have to know how
                    to read him; then there are extraordinary things in him, and he knows how to say
                    inexpressible things; and then there’s something of Rembrandt in the Gospels or
                    of the Gospels in Rembrandt, as you wish, it comes to more or less the same,
                    provided that one understands it rightly, without trying to twist it in the
                    wrong direction, and if one bears in mind the equivalents of the comparisons,
                    which make no claim to diminish the merits of the original figures. If now you
                    can forgive a man for going more deeply into paintings, admit also that the love
                    of books is as holy as that of Rembrandt, and I even think that the two
                    complement each other. I really love the portrait of a man by Fabritius, which
                    one day, also while taking a walk together, we looked at for a long time in the
                    Haarlem museum. Good, but I love Dickens’s ‘Richard Cartone’ in his Paris et
                    Londres en 1793 just as much, and I could show you other strangely vivid figures
                    in yet other books, with more or less striking resemblance. And I think that
                    Kent, a man in Shakespeare’s King Lear, is just as noble and distinguished a
                    character as any figure of Th. de Keyser, although Kent and King Lear are
                    supposed to have lived a long time earlier. To put it no higher, my God, how
                    beautiful that is. Shakespeare — who is as mysterious as he? — his language and
                    his way of doing things are surely the equal of any brush trembling with fever
                    and emotion. But one has to learn to read, as one has to learn to see and learn
                    to live. So you mustn’t think that I’m rejecting this or that; in my unbelief
                    I’m a believer, in a way, and though having changed I am the same, and my
                    torment is none other than this, what could I be good for, couldn’t I serve and
                    be useful in some way, how could I come to know more thoroughly, and go more
                    deeply into this subject or that? Do you see, <stress reason="environment">it
                        continually torments me</stress>, and then you feel a prisoner in penury,
                    excluded from participating in this work or that, and such and such necessary
                    things are beyond your reach. Because of that, you’re not without melancholy,
                    and you feel emptiness where there could be friendship and high and serious
                    affections, and you feel a terrible discouragement gnawing at your psychic
                    energy itself, and fate seems able to put a barrier against the instincts for
                    affection, or a tide of revulsion that overcomes you. And then you say, How
                    long, O Lord! Well, then, what can I say; does what goes on inside show on the
                    outside? Someone has a great fire in his soul and nobody ever comes to warm
                    themselves at it, and passers-by see nothing but a little smoke at the top of
                    the chimney and then go on their way. So now what are we to do, keep this fire
                    alive inside, have salt in ourselves, wait patiently, but with how much
                    impatience, await the hour, I say, when whoever wants to, will come and sit down
                    there, will stay there, for all I know? May whoever believes in God await the
                    hour, which will come sooner or later. Now for the moment all my affairs are
                    going badly, so it would seem, and that has been so for a not so inconsiderable
                    period of time, and it may stay that way for a future of longer or shorter
                    duration, but it may be that after everything has seemed to go wrong, it may
                    then all go better. I’m not counting on it, perhaps it won’t happen, but
                    supposing there were to come some change for the better, I would count that as
                    so much gained; I’d be pleased about it, I’d say, well then, there you are,
                    there was something, after all. </p>
                <p>But you’ll say, though, you’re an execrable creature since you have impossible
                    ideas on religion and childish scruples of conscience. If I have any that are
                    impossible or childish, may I be freed from them; I’d like nothing better. But
                    here’s where I am on this subject, more or less. You’ll find in Souvestre’s Le
                    philosophe sous les toits how a man of the people, a simple workman, very
                    wretched, if you will, imagined his mother country, ‘Perhaps you have never
                    thought about what your mother country is, he continued, putting a hand on my
                    shoulder; it’s everything that surrounds you, everything that raised and
                    nourished you, everything you have loved. This countryside that you see, these
                    houses, these trees, these young girls, laughing as they pass by over there,
                    that’s your mother country! The laws that protect you, the bread that is the
                    reward of your labour, the words that you exchange, the joy and sadness that
                    come to you from the men and the things among which you live, that’s your mother
                    country! The little room where you once used to see your mother, the memories
                    she left you, the earth in which she rests, that’s your mother country! You see
                    it, you breathe it everywhere! Just think, your rights and your duties, your
                    attachments and your needs, your memories and your gratitude, put all that
                    together under a single name, and that name will be your mother country.’ Now
                    likewise, everything in men and in their works that is truly good, and beautiful
                    with an inner moral, spiritual and sublime beauty, I think that that comes from
                    God, and that everything that is bad and wicked in the works of men and in men,
                    that’s not from God, and God doesn’t find it good, either. But without intending
                    it, I’m always inclined to believe that the best way of knowing God is to love a
                    great deal. Love that friend, that person, that thing, whatever you like, you’ll
                    be on the right path to knowing more thoroughly, afterwards; that’s what I say
                    to myself. But you must love with a high, serious intimate sympathy, with a
                    will, with intelligence, and you must always seek to know more thoroughly,
                    better, and more. That leads to God, that leads to unshakeable faith. Someone,
                    to give an example, will love Rembrandt, but seriously, that man will know there
                    is a God, he’ll believe firmly in Him. Someone will make a deep study of the
                    history of the French Revolution — he will not be an unbeliever, he will see
                    that in great things, too, there is a sovereign power that manifests itself.
                    Someone will have attended, for a time only, the free course at the great
                    university of poverty, and will have paid attention to the things he sees with
                    his eyes and hears with his ears, and will have thought about it; he too, will
                    come to believe, and will perhaps learn more about it than he could say. Try to
                    understand the last word of what the great artists, the serious masters, say in
                    their masterpieces; there will be God in it. Someone has written or said it in a
                    book, someone in a painting. And quite simply read the Bible, and the Gospels,
                    because that will give you something to think about, and a great deal to think
                    about and everything to think about, well then, think about this great deal,
                    think about this everything, it raises your thinking above the ordinary level,
                    despite yourself. Since we know how to read, let’s read, then! Now, afterwards,
                    we may well at times be a little absent-minded, a little dreamy; there are those
                    who become a little too absent-minded, a little too dreamy; that happens to me,
                    perhaps, but it’s my own fault. And after all, who knows, wasn’t there some
                    cause; it was for this or that reason that I was absorbed, preoccupied, anxious,
                    but you get over that. The dreamer sometimes falls into a pit, but they say that
                    afterwards he comes up out of it again. </p>
                <p>And the absent-minded man, at times he too has his presence of mind, as if in
                    compensation. He’s sometimes a character who has his raison d’être for one
                    reason or another which one doesn’t always see right away, or which one forgets
                    through being absent-minded, mostly unintentionally. One who has been rolling
                    along for ages as if tossed on a stormy sea arrives at his destination at last;
                    one who has seemed good for nothing and incapable of filling any position, any
                    role, finds one in the end, and, active and capable of action, shows himself
                    entirely different from what he had seemed at first sight. I’m writing you
                    somewhat at random whatever comes into my pen; I would be very happy if you
                    could somehow see in me something other than some sort of idler. Because there
                    are idlers and idlers, who form a contrast. There’s the one who’s an idler
                    through laziness and weakness of character, through the baseness of his nature;
                    you may, if you think fit, take me for such a one. Then there’s the other idler,
                    the idler truly despite himself, who is gnawed inwardly by a great desire for
                    action, who does nothing because he finds it impossible to do anything since
                    he’s imprisoned in something, so to speak, because he doesn’t have what he would
                    need to be productive, because the inevitability of circumstances is reducing
                    him to this point. Such a person doesn’t always know himself what he could do,
                    but he feels by instinct, I’m good for something, even so! I feel I have a
                    raison d’être! I know that I could be a quite different man! For what then could
                    I be of use, for what could I serve! There’s something within me, so what is it!
                    That’s an entirely different idler; you may, if you think fit, take me for such
                    a one. In the springtime a bird in a cage knows very well that there’s something
                    he’d be good for; he feels very clearly that there’s something to be done but he
                    can’t do it; what it is he can’t clearly remember, and he has vague ideas and
                    says to himself, ‘the others are building their nests and making their little
                    ones and raising the brood’, and he bangs his head against the bars of his cage.
                    And then the cage stays there and the bird is mad with suffering. ‘Look, there’s
                    an idler’, says another passing bird — that fellow’s a sort of man of leisure.
                    And yet the prisoner lives and doesn’t die; nothing of what’s going on within
                    shows outside, he’s in good health, he’s rather cheerful in the sunshine. But
                    then comes the season of migration. A bout of melancholy — but, say the children
                    who look after him, he’s got everything that he needs in his cage, after all —
                    but he looks at the sky outside, heavy with storm clouds, and within himself
                    feels a rebellion against fate. I’m in a cage, I’m in a cage, and so I lack for
                    nothing, you fools! Me, I have everything I need! Ah, for pity’s sake, freedom,
                    to be a bird like other birds! </p>
                <p>An idle man like that resembles an idle bird like that. And it’s often impossible
                    for men to do anything, prisoners in I don’t know what kind of horrible,
                    horrible, very horrible cage. There is also, I know, release, belated release. A
                    reputation ruined rightly or wrongly, poverty, inevitability of circumstances,
                    misfortune; that creates prisoners. You may not always be able to say what it is
                    that confines, that immures, that seems to bury, and yet you feel I know not
                    what bars, I know not what gates — walls. Is all that imaginary, a fantasy? I
                    don’t think so; and then you ask yourself, Dear God, is this for long, is this
                    for ever, is this for eternity? You know, what makes the prison disappear is
                    every deep, serious attachment. To be friends, to be brothers, to love; that
                    opens the prison through sovereign power, through a most powerful spell. But he
                    who doesn’t have that remains in death. But where sympathy springs up again,
                    life springs up again. And the prison is sometimes called Prejudice,
                    misunderstanding, fatal ignorance of this or that, mistrust, false shame. But to
                    speak of something else, if I’ve come down in the world, you, on the other hand,
                    have gone up. And while I may have lost friendships, you have won them. That’s
                    what I’m happy about, I say it in truth, and that will always make me glad. If
                    you were not very serious and not very profound, I might fear that it won’t
                    last, but since I think you are very serious and very profound, I’m inclined to
                    believe that it will last. </p>
                <p>But if it became possible for you to see in me something other than an idler of
                    the bad kind, I would be very pleased about that. And if I could ever do
                    something for you, be useful to you in some way, know that I am at your service.
                    Since I’ve accepted what you gave me, you could equally ask me for something if
                    I could be of service to you in some way or another; it would make me happy and
                    I would consider it a sign of trust. We’re quite distant from one another, and
                    in certain respects we may have different ways of seeing, but nevertheless,
                    sometime or some day one of us might be able to be of use to the other. For
                    today, I shake your hand, thanking you again for the kindness you’ve shown me.
                    Now if you’d like to write to me one of these days, my address is care of C.
                    Decrucq, rue du Pavillon 8, Cuesmes, near Mons, and know that by writing you’ll
                    do me good. </p>

            <salutation>Dear Pa and Ma,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>I received your letter and was glad to have it, for I had already been looking
                    forward to it, especially because of Pa’s indisposition. It’s fortunate that
                    he’s starting to get better. Things continue to go quite well with my work,
                    although it’s still imperfect and must improve a lot. I found a very good
                    illustration of a skeleton in that painter’s studio. Because such things are
                    fairly difficult to find, I asked him whether he’d give it to me for a day or
                    two in order to copy it. At first he objected, probably because he thought that
                    I wouldn’t be able to do it or that it would take me too long, but I insisted on
                    having it and he allowed me to. That was last Sunday afternoon, and as soon as I
                    got home I started on it, and on Monday evening it was finished, and to his
                    surprise I brought it back to him on Tuesday morning already and he thought my
                    drawing good, and in fact it isn’t that bad. I’ll profit even more from that man
                    if only he has the time, he’s well informed on some points, especially
                    perspective, and I can anyhow learn a lot from him. Now I must tell you about
                    something else I’ve done. As I told you in a letter, I bought a pair of trousers
                    and a jacket second-hand about a month ago. It turned out so well that I bought
                    another jacket and another pair of trousers from the same man. I was of course
                    more or less provided for by the first one, but having two suits is actually
                    better and they don’t wear out so fast, because one can alternate between them.
                    I herewith send you a sample of the material. And I also needed to supplement my
                    underclothes with 3 pairs of underwear for which I paid 2.75 francs apiece, and
                    I also bought a pair of shoes for 4 francs. I really did have to buy a few
                    things. These few things have made a noticeable hole in what was sent for this
                    month, and I’ll have to tighten my belt rather, especially because I paid the
                    painter 5 francs in advance for the lessons. Don’t be concerned about these
                    expenses, though, and don’t suspect me of recklessness, for in fact the opposite
                    is sooner my failing, and if I could spend more I’d easily progress and make
                    headway more quickly. If you could send me some more this month without
                    inconveniencing yourselves, I’d like to ask it of you after all.</p>
                <p>But if you can’t, there’s no immediate hurry, because I mentioned to my landlord
                    that I might find it hard to manage this month, and it’s all right with him if I
                    pay him when it suits me, because by now he’s known me long enough not to demand
                    absolutely that I pay in advance, at least not a whole month in advance. As
                    regards that other suit, I have another objective apart from wearing it myself
                    for as long as possible, for the fact is that when it’s a bit older it will
                    serve me in another way. You see, I’ll gradually need a small collection of
                    work-clothes with which to dress the models for my drawings. The blue smock of
                    Brabant, for example, the grey linen suit that the miners wear and their leather
                    hat, also a straw hat and clogs, a fisherman’s costume of brown fustian and a
                    sou’wester. And most definitely the clothing made of that kind of black or brown
                    velvet that’s very picturesque and characteristic — furthermore, a red doublet
                    or vest. Likewise a couple of women’s costumes, such as that of Kempen and the
                    area of Antwerp with the Brabantian cap and that of Blankenberge, for example,
                    or Scheveningen or Katwijk. However, it’s by no means my plan to buy all of this
                    at once, but most certainly to gather this and that gradually, piece by piece,
                    when the opportunity arises. And because one can obtain these clothes
                    second-hand, it’s not wholly unattainable. And all of this can get well and
                    truly underway only when I have some kind of studio somewhere permanent.</p>
                <p>This is the only true way to succeed, by drawing from a model with the necessary
                    costumes. Only if I pursue drawing this thoroughly and seriously, always seeking
                    to portray reality, shall I succeed, and then, despite the inevitable expenses,
                    a living can be made out of it. Because a good draughtsman can certainly find
                    work nowadays, and there’s a great demand for such individuals and there are
                    positions to be had that pay very well. So the thing is to try and become as
                    good at it as possible. In Paris there are many draughtsmen who earn 10 or 15
                    francs a day, and in London and elsewhere just as much or even more, but one
                    can’t achieve this all at once and I am by no means that far, but it could well
                    come to that if I’m a little blessed and come again into contact with people
                    like Mr Tersteeg and Theo and, more specifically, with good painters and
                    draughtsmen. But only on the condition that a great deal of work and study be
                    done. It won’t surprise you if I tell you that I’m extraordinarily eager to know
                    what Theo’s proposal could possibly be, or perhaps to hear something from Mr
                    Tersteeg. Because one way or another I must know anyway sometime in the month of
                    March where I stand and how and where I’ll be able to work during the spring and
                    summer months.</p>
                <p>And should I gradually begin to earn some money, that wouldn’t be disagreeable at
                    all, even though the main thing is that I progress and become better at drawing.
                    Then much will fall into place later on, whether it takes a long time or not.
                    Models are expensive, relatively expensive at any rate, and if I could pay them
                    and use them often I’d be able to work much better. But a studio then becomes
                    indispensable. And people like Mr Tersteeg and Theo and others know this very
                    well. Anyway, I’ll have to wait until they write about one thing and another,
                    and meanwhile do what I can. Made a drawing of miners in the snow that’s a
                    little better than the one from last winter, it has more character and
                    effect.</p>
                <p>Am also collecting wood engravings again in the manner of those scrapbooks that
                    Theo and Willemien used to have. For if I have that a bit more complete I may
                    well profit by it, for it could very well be that one day I’ll do work for wood
                    engravings. I want you to know that those clothes I bought are well cut and look
                    better on me than anything else I can remember. I tell you this because you
                    might think they were tawdry or out of the ordinary. This material is worn
                    often, especially in the studios. And now I’ll close, after sending my regards
                    to everyone and after congratulating you on Anna’s birthday, and believe me</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo, </salutation>
            <body>
                <p>In answer to your two good letters and prompted by a visit from Pa, which I’d
                    been looking forward to for some time, I have a few things to tell you. And
                    this, first of all. I heard from Pa that you’ve already been sending me money
                    without my knowing it, and in doing so are effectively helping me to get along.
                    For this accept my heartfelt thanks. I have every confidence that you won’t
                    regret it; in this way I’m learning a handicraft, and although I’ll certainly
                    not grow rich by it, at least I’ll earn the 100 francs a month necessary to
                    support myself once I’m surer of myself as a draughtsman and find steady work.
                    What you told us about the painter Heyerdahl has greatly aroused the interest of
                    both Rappard and myself.</p>
                <p>Because the former will no doubt write to you about it himself, I address this
                    question only because it concerns me personally, to some extent. </p>
                <p>Your remarks about the Dutch artists, that it’s doubtful whether they’d be able
                    to give clear advice on the difficulties of perspective &amp;c. with which I’m
                    wrestling, I find in a certain sense quite correct and true. At any rate, I
                    whole-heartedly agree with you that someone like Heyerdahl, because he seems to
                    be such a highly cultivated man, would be far preferable to some others who
                    might not have the ability to explain their way of doing things to anyone else,
                    or to give one the guidance and advice that’s so necessary. You speak of
                    Heyerdahl as one who takes great pains to seek ‘proportions for the purpose of
                    design’, that’s precisely what I need. Many good painters have no idea, or
                    almost no idea, what ‘proportions for the purpose of design’ are, or beautiful
                    lines or distinctive compositions, and ideas and poetry. Yet these are important
                    questions which Feyen-Perrin and Ulysse Butin and Alphonse Legros, not to
                    mention Breton and Millet and Israëls, take very much to heart and never lose
                    sight of. </p>
                <p>Many Dutch painters would understand nothing, absolutely nothing, of the
                    beautiful work of Boughton, Marks, Millais, Pinwell, Du Maurier, Herkomer,
                    Walker, to name but a few artists who are true masters as ‘draughtsmen’, over
                    and above their qualities in other directions. Many, I say, shrug their
                    shoulders at such work, just as many — even among the painters here in Belgium,
                    who should know better — do at the work of Degroux. I saw 2 things by Degroux
                    this week that I didn’t know yet, namely a painting, The conscript’s departure,
                    and a drawing in vertical format, The drunkard, two compositions that so much
                    resemble Boughton that I was struck by the resemblance, as of two brothers who
                    had never met each other but were nevertheless kindred spirits. So you see that
                    I share your view of Heyerdahl, that I’ll consider myself fortunate if you can
                    put me in touch with that man later on, that I certainly won’t insist on having
                    my way about going to Holland, not, at least, if I have the prospect of going to
                    Paris later on and can more or less count on it. In the meantime, though, what
                    should I do? What would you think best? I can carry on working at Rappard’s for
                    a week or so, but then he’ll probably be leaving. My bedroom is all too small
                    and the light isn’t good, and the people would object to my shutting out some of
                    the light coming in through the window, I’m not even allowed to hang my etchings
                    on the wall or my drawings. So when Rappard leaves here in May I’ll have to
                    move, and in that case I’d very much like to work in the country for a while,
                    Heist, Kalmthout, Etten, Scheveningen, Katwijk or wherever. Or even, which is
                    closer, Schaarbeek, Haren, Groenendaal. But preferably a place where there’s a
                    chance of coming into contact with other painters, and if possible of living and
                    working together, because that’s cheaper and better. The cost of accommodation,
                    no matter where, is at least 100 francs a month, anything less means suffering
                    deprivation, either bodily or through a lack of indispensable materials and
                    tools. </p>
                <p>This winter I spent around 100 francs a month, I reckon, although in truth it was
                    scarcely that much. And of that I spent a considerable amount on drawing
                    materials and also bought some clothes. Namely bought two workmen’s suits of
                    coarse black velvet, of the material I think one calls velveteen. They look
                    smart and one looks presentable in them; moreover, they’ll come in handy later
                    on, for I’ll need a great many workman’s clothes later, and even now already,
                    for my models, whom I naturally need like anyone else. Gradually I’ll have to
                    acquire articles of clothing of all kinds, second-hand if necessary, both men’s
                    and women’s clothing, for that purpose. Naturally this doesn’t have to happen
                    all at once, though I’ve already made a start and shall continue.</p>
                <p>You say, and rightly so, that financial matters have done a lot both to assist
                    and to thwart people in the world. So be it, and the words of Bernard Palissy
                    remain true: ‘Poverty prevents good minds succeeding’. But when I think about
                    it, I nonetheless say, Could it be that in a family like ours, in which 2 Messrs
                    van Gogh are very rich, and that in the art business, C.M. and our uncle at
                    Princenhage, and in which you and I in the present generation have also chosen
                    that line of work, albeit in different spheres, I say, notwithstanding these
                    facts, could it be that I can’t continue to count in one way or another on those
                    100 francs a month for the time that must necessarily elapse before I obtain
                    regular employment as a draughtsman? 3 years ago I had words with Uncle Cor on
                    an entirely different matter, but is that any reason for C.M. to bear me ill
                    will for ever and ever? I much prefer to assume that he never bore me any ill
                    will, and view it as a misunderstanding for which I gladly take the entire
                    blame, rather than bickering about whether and to what extent I’m to blame,
                    because I have no time for such arguments. Now, Uncle Cor so often does things
                    to help other draughtsmen, and would it now be so very unnatural for him to take
                    an active interest in me as well, should the occasion arise? I say these things,
                    however, not so much to obtain financial help from His Hon. but rather because I
                    think it wouldn’t be good if he were to show himself completely unwilling for
                    there to be a vigorous renewal of harmony, at least, between us. His Hon. could
                    help me a great deal in a wholly different way than by giving me money, for
                    example by putting me in touch, if possible, now or later, with people from whom
                    I could learn a great deal. And, if possible, by His Hon.’s mediating to bring
                    about one thing or another during the time that must still elapse before I
                    obtain regular employment — in Paris, for example — at some illustrated magazine
                    or other. I also spoke to Pa in this vein, I don’t know whether it will be of
                    any use, but I noticed that they were talking about how strange and inexplicable
                    it was that I had to struggle so hard even though I belonged to such and such a
                    family. In reply to this I said that I thought that this was a passing thing and
                    would be set to rights later. Nonetheless, it seemed to me advisable to speak to
                    Pa and to you about it, and I wrote to Mr Tersteeg and mentioned it briefly, but
                    His Hon. seems not to have understood my meaning, because he took it to mean
                    that I was planning to live out of C.M.’s pocket and, this being his
                    interpretation, he wrote me a rather discouraging letter and said that I had no
                    right to such a thing. I don’t claim to have the right, but I wish to prevent
                    the matter being talked about sooner or later in the studios, and so, in my
                    opinion, harmony must be restored between me and the family, at least
                    temporarily and in the eyes of the world, in expectation of their changing their
                    minds about me. If they refuse, so be it, but then I can’t prevent it being
                    talked about here and there. If I were to write immediately to C.M., or to go
                    and see His Hon., there would be a chance that he wouldn’t read my letter or
                    would receive me all too brusquely, so I’m speaking about it to Pa and to you,
                    because you’ll probably be able to say a word or two about it in passing, and
                    then he won’t misconstrue my meaning. It isn’t my intention to obtain money from
                    His Hon., as Mr Tersteeg thought, unless it be the case that after talking to me
                    he acquires faith and confidence in my future and starts to see me in an
                    entirely different light. And if he were to be convinced of it, then I’d
                    certainly not spurn his help, that goes without saying, and then he would be
                    able to smooth my way a little in an entirely different way than by giving me
                    money, for instance, in the interval of time between now and going to Paris. I
                    wrote to Mr Tersteeg that it didn’t surprise me in the least that he had
                    interpreted my letter in that way, since you had also spoken at one time of
                    ‘idling’. And just as I now understand from the tone of your letter that you no
                    longer see my difficult position in that dismal light, and experience it as well
                    through your effective assistance, so I hope that Mr Tersteeg, too, will
                    gradually change his opinion. The more so because His Hon. was the first to help
                    me with those Bargues, for which I’ll always be grateful. Now you write about a
                    manikin. There’s no particular hurry, but it would be of great use to me in
                    composing and finding poses, you’re sensible of that. However, I’d rather wait a
                    bit longer and have a better one than have a tool sooner that was far too
                    inadequate. Be sure and keep an eye out, though, for all manner of prints or
                    books about proportion, and find out as much as you can about them, that’s of
                    inestimable value, without it one can’t make a figure drawing quickly. Moreover,
                    it would be very beneficial for me to have a thing or two about the anatomy of
                    the horse and sheep, cow, not with an eye to veterinary medicine but rather with
                    a view to drawing the aforementioned animals. If I’m asking you for all these
                    things like this, it’s because you’ll most likely have an opportunity to find
                    such prints very cheaply, relatively speaking, just as I’ve already found a few
                    myself, and you’d perhaps pay them less heed if I hadn’t said that they’re of
                    such great use to me. If you ever have an opportunity to ask Bargue or
                    Viollet-le-Duc, for example, about those prints about proportion, that’s most
                    probably the best place for such information. I should, of course, find it
                    wonderful to live with you later on, but we haven’t reached that point yet. If
                    C.M. could be persuaded to give me a chance to learn the ropes somewhere on a
                    temporary basis, I’d certainly not scorn it. One can sometimes learn much
                    indirectly even from relatively bad artists, just as, for example, Mauve learned
                    a great deal from Verschuur about bringing a stable and a wagon into
                    perspective, and the anatomy of a horse, and yet how Mauve towers above
                    Verschuur. If by any chance you can recommend the painting of Madiol at the
                    Salon, do so, for there’s much that’s beautiful in it, and the man is in a fix
                    and has lots of small children. He’s painting a smithy that will also be good,
                    and he recently made a little old woman that is superb in its drawing and
                    especially colour. But he’s very inconsistent. His chalk drawings are often
                    outstanding. </p>
                <p>This letter is really rather long, but I can’t make it any shorter. If I mention
                    that it would be desirable for at least the general public, but in fact even
                    more so for C.M. and others, to change their minds about me, it’s because people
                    like Roelofs, for example, don’t know what to think of such an untoward
                    position, whether there is something wrong with me or with the other side, but
                    he sees that there is something wrong somewhere anyhow. Such a person is
                    therefore too circumspect and will have nothing to do with me at present, just
                    when it’s most necessary for me to receive advice and help. And such experiences
                    are unpleasant, to say the least, it remains to be seen whether, working on with
                    patient energy, I gradually make progress notwithstanding. I mean to. Where
                    there is a will there is a way. And would I be to blame later on if I were to
                    take revenge?</p>
                <p>Nonetheless, a draughtsman doesn’t draw for the sake of revenge but for the love
                    of drawing, and that’s more compelling than any other reason. And so it’s likely
                    that later on some things will be set to rights that aren’t quite right yet.
                    I’ve collected a lot of woodcuts this winter. Your Millets have been augmented
                    with various others, and you’ll see that your wealth of woodcuts &amp;c. haven’t
                    had an unproductive stay with me. I now have 24 woodcuts by or after Millet,
                    counting the Labours of the fields. But my own drawing is the main thing, and
                    everything has to work towards that. The cheapest thing, of course, would be for
                    me to spend this summer in Etten, there’s subject matter enough there. If you
                    think this desirable, you can write to Pa about it, I’m willing to conform to
                    what they want as regards clothing or anything else, and I’d most likely run
                    into C.M. there this summer, if he were to go there or to Princenhage. There’s
                    no real objection to it, as far as I know. I’ll always be judged or talked about
                    in differing ways, whether within or outside the family, and one will always
                    hear the most wide-ranging opinions being put forward. </p>
                <p>And I don’t blame anyone for it, for relatively very few people know why a
                    draughtsman does this or that. </p>
                <p>Peasants and townsfolk, however, generally impute very great wickedness and evil
                    intentions never dreamt of by one who betakes himself to all manner of places,
                    corners and holes that others prefer not to visit, in order to find picturesque
                    places or figures. A peasant who sees me drawing an old tree-trunk and sees me
                    sitting there in front of it for an hour thinks I’m mad, and naturally laughs at
                    me. A young lady who turns up her nose at a workman in his patched and dusty and
                    sweaty work-clothes can’t understand, of course, why anyone visits the Borinage
                    or Heist and goes down a coal-mine all the way to the maintenages, and she, too,
                    comes to the conclusion that I’m mad. All that, though, doesn’t matter to me in
                    the slightest, of course, if only you and Mr Tersteeg and C.M. and Pa and others
                    I’m concerned with know better and, far from criticizing it, say instead, your
                    line of work involves that, and we understand why it is so. So that I repeat, in
                    the circumstances there’s actually no particular reason why I shouldn’t be able
                    to go to Etten, for example, or to The Hague, if it should work out that way,
                    even if little gentlemen and ladies chop logic on the subject. So, since Pa said
                    to me during his visit, do write to Theo and arrange with him what would be best
                    and least expensive, be so good as to let me know your views on this matter
                    before long. Heist (near Blankenberge, thus on the sea) or Kalmthout are very
                    picturesque, there’s subject matter in Etten as well, here too if necessary,
                    although I’d move to Schaarbeek all the same. Scheveningen or Katwijk would of
                    course be possible if C.M. were to change his opinion of me, and then I could
                    profit directly or indirectly from the artists in Holland. As far as expenses
                    go, I reckon them to be at least around 100 francs a month, less isn’t possible,
                    ‘thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn’. And so I’ll wait
                    until you write more concerning one thing and another, and will work at
                    Rappard’s in the meantime. Rappard has really painted some spirited studies,
                    including a few from the models at the academy which are vigorously conceived. A
                    bit more passion or emotion would do him no harm, a little more self-confidence
                    and a little more daring. Someone once said to me, We must make an effort like
                    the lost, like the desperate. But he isn’t doing it yet. I find his landscape
                    drawings in pen very witty and pleasing, in those too, though, gradually a bit
                    more passion please! And now I take my leave with a handshake in thought, and
                    remain </p>

            <salutation> My dear Theo, </salutation>
            <body>
                <p>My sincere congratulations on your birthday. I think of your visit time and
                    again, I’m glad we spoke to each other again in this way, and hope it turns out
                    that you’ll come again in the summer. I’ve been here for a few days and
                        <unstress reason="environment">it’s beautiful outdoors</unstress>, but the
                    weather doesn’t yet permit of drawing outdoors every day.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile <work origin="new" stage="sketch">I’ve started on the Millets</work>,
                    The sower is finished and the 4 times of the day sketched. And now still to come
                    are The labours of the field. As you know, there was an exhibition of
                    watercolours in Brussels and it was quite interesting. There were 4 or 5 Mauves,
                    woodcutters, 1 J. Maris, dunes, just like a painting by Ruisdael or Van de
                    Velde. Then J.H. Weissenbruch, superb, 5 large drawings, Roelofs ditto, also 5
                    large pieces. Then Gabrië and Van de Sande Bakhuyzen and Valkenburg and Van
                    Trigt and P. Stortenbeker, and Vogel&amp;c. of the Dutchmen.</p>
                <p> Then there was a Mesdag that one had to imagine wasn’t there in order to see any
                    of the other drawings, at least that’s how it was with me. The beach at
                    twilight, stormy weather, sky with grey clouds with a ruddy glow from the sun,
                    which had set.</p>
                <p> In the foreground a fisherman on a horse, a tall, singular, dark silhouette
                    standing out against the white, foaming waves. This figure is speaking with
                    people on board a pink floating in the middle ground. On deck people are busy
                    with a lantern, and they’re evidently speaking to the man on horseback about the
                    anchor, which he must come and fetch. It was a large, important drawing, broadly
                    done and so powerful that, as I said, nothing else could hold a candle to
                    it.</p>
                <p> What also struck me were 2 drawings by Ter Meulen, sheep in the dunes and ditto
                    in the snow, he’s becoming really good. If I remember rightly, I saw that man
                    struggling and swotting in Bakhuyzen’s studio, and now he’s succeeded all the
                    same, those two drawings, at any rate, were excellent.</p>
                <p> Then there were drawings by Meunier, Farm-hand in a barn, distinguished in
                    colour and treatment, and in conception reminiscent of Millet, for instance, as
                    regards simplicity and faithfulness to nature. Also by him a stoker and a
                    factory worker.</p>
                <p> There were also various drawings by Rochussen. And many others, but Meunier was
                    the only one of the Belgians who actually moved me. Rappard is going to Holland
                    in 3 weeks, and will probably carry on working in the countryside this summer
                    and then possibly go to Paris next winter, but as yet he won’t go there with the
                    intention of staying. I believe that he really received a cold shower when he
                    was there earlier, but that’s no reason to think that he won’t have more luck
                    during his next stay. He’s certainly progressed a good deal since then.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="career">I’m very glad indeed</unstress> that it’s been
                    arranged for me to work here quietly for a while, I hope to make as many studies
                    as I possibly can, for that’s the seed from which later drawings will grow. Do
                    write to me from time to time and keep me informed, if possible, of one thing
                    and another that strikes you, and think of me if you happen to hear of a
                    position for a draughtsman somewhere or other.</p>
                <p> And now it’s time for the post, I’ll keep you informed of what I’m doing, and
                    you must also tell me from time to time what you would advise me, by preference,
                    to draw and to look out for. Sometimes I’ll find it useful, sometimes perhaps
                    not, but don’t hesitate to tell me one thing and another, I’ll do the same to
                    you, and then we must both try to separate the wheat from the chaff.</p>
            </body>
            <close> Adieu, with a handshake in thought. </close>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>As a letter is going to you again, I’m enclosing a word in it. I sincerely hope
                    that you’re doing well and will be able to find half an hour to write to me
                    again. I want to tell you what I’ve done since I last wrote to you. First of
                    all, two large drawings (chalk and some sepia) of <work origin="existing"
                        stage="middle">Pollard willows</work>, something like the sketch below.</p>



                <p>Also the same, but vertical, <work origin="existing" stage="middle">of
                        Leurseweg</work>. Then I had a model a couple of times, <work
                        origin="existing" stage="middle">digger and basket-maker</work>. And then
                    last week I got a box of paints from Uncle Cent that is rather good, certainly
                    good enough to start with (the paint is from Paillard). And I’m very glad to
                    have it. </p>


                <p>I’ve just tried making <work origin="existing" stage="middle">a kind of
                        watercolour</work>, like the above motif. </p>
                <p>I count myself very lucky to be able to get models, I’m also searching around for
                    a horse and donkey. That thick Ingres paper is especially good for drawing with
                    watercolour, and a great deal cheaper than other paper. Still, there’s no
                    particular hurry, because I have some on hand, but unfortunately plain white
                    brought from The Hague. Anyway, you see that I’m hard at work. Uncle Cent will
                    be going to The Hague tomorrow and will most likely speak with Mauve again about
                    when I should next visit him. And now adieu, have walked far today and am
                    surprisingly tired, but didn’t want the letter to leave without enclosing
                    something. I wish you well, and accept a handshake in thought.</p>

            </head>
            <salutation>Old boy,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>How you took my two previous letters isn’t yet apparent to me from your letter of
                    today to Pa and Ma. Precisely because you neither enclosed a letter for me nor
                    mentioned receiving my letters, I take it that I’ll soon be getting a letter
                    from you. And in the circumstances I’d much rather that you write to me after
                    reading both of my letters, or, this one included, all three of them, which
                    supplement one another and don’t stand alone, than that you’d have immediately
                    answered only the first one alone. How cold and harsh my first letter must have
                    sounded, and you undoubtedly thought then that I was already very callous and
                    hardened. But was it wrong of me? And will you think badly of me for not
                    immediately revealing my more tender and intimate feelings, since they would
                    have found you, O man of business! in the fever of daily affairs, which is not
                    exactly the mood to appreciate love stories. So I thought something along the
                    lines of: no, first we’ll wake him up and only then will we sow softer words in
                    His Hon. We’ll plough him first, this man who ‘deftly dispatches business’.
                    That’s why the first letter was as cold as a ploughshare. But as to the second,
                    was I wrong in claiming that it would be more serious and intimate? And now that
                    we’ve begun to talk more intimately, we want to go on doing so. But ‘meanwhile’
                    – a bit more ploughshare. It begins here. Although you’ve come a long way
                    without a ‘she and no other’, although you stand firm in your shoes without a
                    she and no other, although you deftly dispatch business without a she and no
                    other, although you are a man of willpower, energy and character without a she
                    and no other, although you’ve gained human understanding and experience without
                    a she and no other, although you possess cheerfulness and high spirits and
                    courage without a she and no other, although you dare to choose sides and loathe
                    vacillation without.... Nevertheless, you would go much further, stand firmer in
                    your shoes, dispatch business more deftly, be more a man of willpower, energy
                    and character, gain more human understanding and experience, possess more
                    cheerfulness, high spirits and courage, choose sides more resolutely, be even
                    more loathful of vacillation, hesitation, doubt &amp;c. than you have been thus
                    far, when you’ll have found someone suited to being your ‘she and no other’. In
                    short, you’ll be more yourself, happier and better, with an honestly meant and
                    deeply felt ‘she and no other’ than without the same. </p>
                <p>The bit of ploughshare continues — don’t let it anger you! Your letter to Pa and
                    Ma was so gloomy in a way, and to tell you the honest truth I couldn’t make head
                    or tail of it and don’t know what to think. Is there anything serious or not?
                    And some of the things you said amazed me, first of all because it was you
                    saying them, and second because you said them to Pa and Ma. After all, it’s you
                    more than anyone who keep all your great and petty miseries of human life to
                    yourself, and if you chance to voice them it is to those whom you know to be
                    strong in whatever it is that might be making you feel vulnerable. In short, I
                    think that when you feel insecure about something, you confess that insecurity
                    only to someone you know can cure you of it. Indeed, just this summer you
                    yourself told me that you considered it better not to speak of life’s
                    difficulties but thought it better to keep them to yourself in order, you said,
                    not to lose your resilience. I found such strength of mind very impressive, even
                    though I was far from sympathizing and am aware that all too often my need for
                    sympathy has tempted me to seek it from those who, instead of bolstering me up,
                    tended rather to weaken my resolve. Pa and Ma are really good, but they have
                    little idea of one’s actual state of mind and the actual circumstances of either
                    you or me. They love us, especially you, with all their heart, and at bottom we,
                    you and I both, love them truly. But alas! In many cases they cannot give us
                    practical advice, and there are instances when they don’t understand us, no
                    matter how hard they try. It’s not that they or we are to blame as much as the
                    difference in age and a different way of thinking, the difference in
                    circumstances. I do believe, Theo, that no matter how great the love you and Pa
                    and Ma feel for one another, they nevertheless imagine you to be very different
                    from what you really are. And I think that you and I would do better to talk
                    about business as well as about more intimate affairs of the heart with people
                    like Mr Tersteeg and Mauve, for instance, than with Pa and Ma. Is the
                    ploughshare very cold and sharp — old boy? </p>
                <p>I say this from my own experience. Still, I don’t mean to say that we should hide
                    our hearts’ secrets from Pa and Ma and not give them our trust. God forbid. It’s
                    also not my opinion that Pa and Ma’s advice is wrong or silly. God forbid that
                    too. But we shouldn’t expect from them such practical and such indispensable
                    advice as others would perhaps be able to give us (Mr T. and M., for instance)
                    who understand more from half a word than Pa and Ma from a careful explanation.
                    I consider it possible that I’m wrong about this, but think about it and share
                    your thoughts on the matter with me, if you will. But — that our home is and
                    will continue to be our refuge, come what may, and we do well to appreciate this
                    and are obliged for our part to honour that home — I agree with you entirely on
                    that score, though you probably didn’t expect such a frank declaration from me.
                    Even so, there’s a refuge that is better, more necessary, more indispensable
                    than our home with Pa and Ma, no matter how good, how necessary, how
                    indispensable that may be, and that is our own hearth and home with our
                    respective ‘she and no other’. So then, O man of business, who dispatches
                    business deftly, behold your greatest business affair, your own home with your
                    own ‘she and no other’. Behold, in my view, the point which you do well to keep
                    sight of, the remedy which, more than any other ‘tonic’, will stimulate and
                    renew more and more every day your courage to face life, your high spirits, your
                    vigour and energy. Several things you said in your letter of today now make me
                    say: Suppose there were a special reason for you to be more than ever on the qui
                    vive and to act forcefully and intelligently, suppose someone were trying to
                    undermine you and there were some trouble or predicament, don’t forget that
                    you’re 26 years old and in ‘the prime of life’. Strike the best blow you’ve ever
                    struck! Thoroughly renew yourself! By being especially on the qui vive in the
                    sense that you look at girls somewhat more seriously and observantly, and see
                    for once whether your ‘she and no other’ isn’t among them. Here ends the
                    ploughshare. </p>

                <p>Perhaps you remember that we talked this summer about the question of women, both
                    with a kind of despondency. That we felt, or thought we felt, something like,
                    Woman is the desolation of the righteous man. And — and — I and possibly you
                    too, at least a little bit, were in our view ‘the Mr Righteous in question’.
                    Whether the above words are true or not I’m in no position to say, because since
                    this summer I’ve begun to doubt if I actually knew then, first ‘what a woman
                    is’, and second ‘what a righteous man is’. And I set out to examine both
                    questions more closely, the result of such examination being that now I often
                    say to myself, You don’t yet know what a woman is, you don’t yet know what a
                    righteous man is, except that you aren’t yet such a one.</p>

                <p>Which is completely different from my frame of mind this summer. Not I but père
                    Michelet says to all young men like you and me, ‘a woman must breathe upon you
                    if you’re to be a man’. She has breathed upon me, my dear chap! What do you
                    mean? Because three times she has answered ‘never’. That, my dear chap, is one
                    of their ways of breathing upon a monster, and there’s the monster who turns
                    into a man! For love of her! She and no other! Do you understand, my dear chap?
                    In the same way and conversely must ‘a man breathe upon a woman if she is to be
                    a woman’? I think so very certainly. If you ask me, How to breathe on her?
                    Here’s my clear and simple answer, By setting against her ‘never’ these other
                    words, ‘my dear, I love you and you will love me, may God help us’. One must
                    have loved, and have fallen out of love, and love on! Do you understand, my dear
                    chap? No! where is thy sting? Never, where is thy victory! To love again, it is
                    God’s will! Do you understand ─ my dear chap? </p>

                <p>Behold, therefore, a love story for you, man of business! Do you think it very
                    tedious and very sentimental? Once I’d firmly resolved neither to leave her nor
                    to return from following after her, even if this might incur her displeasure at
                    first, once I clung simply and solely to the ‘she and no other’ and the ‘love
                    on’, then I felt a certain calm and determination. Then my despondency also
                    disappeared, then all things became new for me, then, too, my physical energy
                    increased. And even though I haven’t yet come to the end of the no, nay, never,
                    and unfortunately therefore am to this day a soul in need, <stress
                        reason="career">I still consider my conduct unregrettable</stress>. By this
                    I don’t mean to say that I did not, do not or will not do any clumsy, awkward
                    things, but that the mistakes I did make, am making and will yet make don’t
                    alter the fact that there’s a straight path before me upon which I walk, and
                    that the ‘she and no other’ and the ‘love on’ are principles which I do well to
                    adhere to. There are, however, those who think that I ought to have resigned
                    myself and think that it goes ‘against the rules’ not to consider myself
                    defeated, but if one says of my declaration of this summer, ‘the cat gets the
                    birds who sing too soon’, then you know the verse, </p>
                <p>Indeed, he lost feathers galore, But what, my fine sirs, was in store? They grew
                    better than ever before.</p>

                <p>And as for ‘the rejection’ I got this summer, I’d be ashamed if I hadn’t got it.
                    I won’t trade it for ‘no rejection’ (it was suggested that I view it as ‘not
                    having happened’, but I said ‘it did happen’) in the sense of ‘not having
                    happened’, but only for ‘no rejection’ in the sense of ‘love on’! </p>
                <p>Now, however, it’s <stress reason="love"> ‘a petty misery of human life’</stress>
                    for me that I can’t even occasionally visit her or write to her, and that those
                    who, with me, might exert a wholesome influence on the undermining or
                    bankrupting of that ‘no, nay, never’ instead rather too readily bring grist to
                    the mill of ‘no, nay, never’. I would that she found no sympathy, anywhere or
                    from anyone, for her ‘no, nay, never’, and that all would combine their efforts
                    culpably to bankrupt that ‘no, nay, never’. In short, to reduce it once and for
                    all to a monument, warning other no-nay-never-saying ladies and encouraging
                    those who say ‘love on’. But we haven’t reached that point yet; but you, you
                    Theo, don’t be for the ‘no, nay, never’ but instead for the ‘love on’! I’d think
                    it very decent of you if, for example, you were to find a way of persuading Pa
                    and Ma,<stress reason="family"> who are extremely pessimistic about this and
                        call what I did this summer ‘untimely’ and ‘indelicate’</stress> (until I
                    begged them very decidedly and definitely, after first having used more
                    temperate reasoning in vain, no longer to apply such expressions to this love of
                    mine, because otherwise I would be forced, proud as a lion, to go against them),
                    I should, I say, think it very decent of you if you were to move them to less
                    pessimism and more good courage and humanity. A word from you probably has more
                    influence on them than anything I could say, and it would be so good, both for
                    them and for me, if, instead of trying to thwart me in my progress, they let me
                    quietly proceed.</p>
                <p>They would, for instance, like me to break off all correspondence whatsoever with
                    Uncle and Aunt Stricker. Naturally I can’t promise anything of the kind, and
                    even if I were to cut off my correspondence with them for a while, I’d only take
                    it up again afterwards with renewed vigour. She doesn’t want to read my letters
                    but — but — but — the frost and winter cold is all too bitter to last for long.
                    I find it much healthier and more natural that, when I first spoke to her of
                    these things, she responded so very energetically with that ‘no, nay, never’.
                    Precisely that — gives me the assurance that there existed some fatal condition
                    and the hope that I’ve touched upon the very heart of that condition of wrapping
                    oneself up in the past too much. Now there follows a crisis of indignation, but
                    the operating surgeon laughs up his sleeve and says ‘touché’. Between you and
                    me! Let this be between you and me! Listen, Theo, she mustn’t find out that I’m
                    laughing up my sleeve about the result of the lancet’s cut. I’m rather repentant
                    towards her, of course. ‘Have I hurt you? Oh, how coarse and hard I’ve been! How
                    could I have been like that?’ That’s my attitude towards her. Very contrite and
                    humble letter to Uncle Stricker, but nonetheless said ‘she and no other’ to His
                    Hon. You won’t betray me, brother! Viewing what has happened as not having
                    happened, that’s nothing but nonsense and humbug. I’ll have none of it. Old
                    chap, I’m so happy about ‘that rejection’, I’d really like to shout it to the
                    skies, but I have to keep quiet. And attack her again in some way or other. But
                    how to approach her? How to get near her? Some time or other, very unexpectedly
                    and unforeseen. Because if I don’t stick to my guns, that fatal condition of
                    wrapping oneself up in the past too much will return seven times stronger, and
                    the matter of ‘love on’ is indeed such a good thing and surely worth
                    surrendering one’s soul to. </p>
                <p>Well,<stress reason="family"> I’ve grumbled a bit about Pa and Ma</stress>, but
                    except that <stress reason="family">they really don’t have the remotest idea of
                        how matters stand</stress>, and understand nothing of the ‘love on’, and
                    could think of nothing else to say than untimely and indelicate until I stopped
                    them, they are very good to me, and kinder than ever. But I would rather that
                    they had a little more understanding of my thoughts and view of things. They
                    think along the lines of a kind of resignation strategy regarding many things to
                    which I cannot resign myself. Well, a letter from you making light of the no,
                    nay, never would possibly prove very effective. This summer, for instance, a
                    single word from Ma would have given me the opportunity to say many things to
                    her that couldn’t be said in public. She resolutely refused to say that word,
                    however; instead, she cut short my opportunity. And came to me with a face full
                    of pity and all kinds of consoling words, and without doubt she said a very nice
                    prayer for me that would have granted me the strength to resign myself anyway.
                    But until now that prayer has gone unanswered, and instead I’ve been given the
                    strength to act. You understand that someone who wants to act cannot entirely
                    approve of his mother praying for resignation for him. And also finds her
                    consoling words slightly misplaced, so long as he doesn’t despair but says from
                    the bottom of his heart, </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="environment">I do not accept the yoke of despair</stress>. I
                    would that she hadn’t prayed for me but had given me the opportunity for an
                    intimate conversation with her. Furthermore, instead of bringing grist to the
                    mill of no, nay, never, she could have looked after my interests, when Kee spoke
                    confidentially to her and poured her heart out, and instead of going along with
                    no, nay, never, she could have said ‘love on’. I tell you these things to prove
                    that an energetic ‘love on’! from you, directed at Pa and Ma, would be doing me
                    a true kindness. For I’m right in thinking, am I not, brother, that we aren’t
                    just brothers but also friends and kindred spirits, especially with respect to
                    Love on? Adieu, write soon, a handshake in thought, believe me </p>

            <salutation> My dear Theo, </salutation>
            <body>
                <p>As I already wrote to you from The Hague, I have some things to discuss with you
                    now that I’m back here. It’s not without emotion that I look back on my trip to
                    The Hague. When I went to see M.<stress reason="career"> my heart was beating
                        rather hard</stress>, because I was thinking to myself, will he too try and
                    fob me off or will I find something else here? And well, what I experienced with
                    him was that he instructed and encouraged me in all manner of kind and practical
                    ways. Though not merely by always approving of everything I did or said, on the
                    contrary. But if he tells me, this or that isn’t good, then it’s because he’s
                    saying at the same time ‘but try it this way or that way’, and that’s entirely
                    different from criticizing for the sake of criticizing. Or if someone says
                    ‘you’re ill with this or that’, that doesn’t help much, but if someone says ‘do
                    this or that and you’ll get better’, and his advice isn’t deceit, look, that’s
                    the real thing, and – and – it naturally helps. Now I’ve come from him with a
                    few <work origin="existing" stage="finished">painted studies</work> and a couple
                    of <work origin="existing" stage="finished">watercolours</work>. Of course they
                    aren’t masterpieces and yet I truly believe there’s something sound and real in
                    them, more at least than in what I’ve made up to now. And so I now consider
                    myself to be at the beginning of the beginning of making something serious. And
                    because I now have a few more technical resources at my disposal, namely paint
                    and brush, all things are made new again, as it were.</p>
                <p> But – now we have to put it into practice. And the first thing is that I must
                    find a room large enough to be able to take a sufficient distance. Mauve just
                    said to me, when he saw my studies, ‘you’re too close to your model’. In many
                    cases this makes it next to impossible to take the necessary measurements for
                    the proportions, so this is certainly one of the first things I have to watch
                    out for. Now I must arrange to rent a large room somewhere, be it a room or a
                    shed. And that won’t be so terribly expensive. A labourer’s cottage in these
                    parts costs 30 guilders a year to rent, so it seems to me that a room twice as
                    large as that in a labourer’s cottage would cost something like 60 guilders.</p>
                <p> And that isn’t insurmountable. I’ve already seen a shed, though it has too many
                    inconveniences, especially in the winter. But I’d be able to work there, at
                    least when the weather is milder. And here in Brabant, moreover, there are
                    models to be found, I believe, not only in Etten but also in other villages, if
                    difficulties were to arise here.</p>
                <p> Still, though I love Brabant very much, I also have a feeling for other figures
                    than the Brabant peasant types. Scheveningen, for example, I again found
                    unspeakably beautiful. But after all I’m here, and it would very probably be
                    cheaper to stay here. However, I’ve definitely promised M. that I’ll do my
                    utmost to find a good studio, and now I must also use better paint and better
                    paper.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, Ingres paper is excellent for studies and scratches. And it’s much
                    cheaper to make sketchbooks in all formats from it oneself than to buy
                    ready-made sketchbooks. I still have a small supply of Ingres paper, but you’d
                    be doing me a big favour if you could send some more of the same kind when you
                    send back those studies. Not pure white, though, but the colour of unbleached
                    linen, no cold shades. </p>
                <p>Theo, what a great thing tone and colour are! And anyone who doesn’t acquire a
                    feeling for it, how far removed from life he will remain! M. has taught me to
                    see so many things I didn’t see before, and when I have the opportunity I’ll try
                    and tell you about what he’s told me, because perhaps there are still one or two
                    things that you don’t see properly either. Anyway, we’ll talk about artistic
                    matters sometime, I hope.</p>
                <p> And you can’t imagine <unstress reason="money">the feeling of relief I’m
                        beginning to get when I think of the things M. said to me about earning
                        money</unstress>. Just think of how I’ve slogged away for years, always in a
                    kind of false position. And now, now there’s a glimmer of real light.</p>
                <p> I do wish that you could see the <work origin="existing" stage="finished">two
                        watercolours</work> I’ve brought with me, because you would see that they’re
                    watercolours just like any other watercolours. There may be many imperfections
                    in them, be that as it may, I’d be the first to say that I’m still very
                    dissatisfied with them, and yet, it’s different from what I’ve done up to now,
                    and it looks fresher and sounder. All the same, it must become much fresher and
                    sounder, but one can’t do what one wants all at once. It comes gradually. I need
                    those couple of drawings myself, however, to compare with what I’ll be making
                    here, because I have to do them at least as well as what I did at M.’s.</p>
                <p>But even though Mauve tells me that if I continue to slog away here for a couple
                    of months and then go back to him again in March, for instance, I’ll then be
                    able to make saleable drawings on a regular basis, I’m nevertheless going
                    through a rather difficult period. The cost of models, studio, drawing and
                    painting materials are multiplying, and there are no earnings as yet.</p>
                <p>Admittedly, Pa said that I needn’t be afraid of the inevitable expense, and Pa is
                    pleased with what M. himself said to him, and also with the studies and drawings
                    I brought back. But I do find it utterly, utterly wretched that Pa should suffer
                    by it. Of course we hope that things will turn out well later, but still, it
                    weighs heavily on my heart. Because since I’ve been here Pa really hasn’t
                    profited from me, and more than once he’s bought a coat or trousers, for
                    example, which I’d actually rather not have had, even though I really needed it,
                    but Pa shouldn’t suffer by it. The more so if the coat and trousers in question
                    don’t fit and are only half or not at all what I need. Anyway, still more petty
                    vexations of human life. And, as I’ve told you before, I find it absolutely
                    terrible not to be free at all. Because even though Pa doesn’t ask me to account
                    for literally every penny, still, he always knows exactly how much I spend and
                    what I spend it on. And now, although I don’t necessarily have any secrets, I
                    don’t really like people being able to look at my cards. Even my secrets aren’t
                    necessarily secrets to those for whom I feel sympathy.</p>
                <p> But Pa isn’t the kind of man for whom I can feel what I feel for you, for
                    example, or for Mauve. I really do love Pa and Ma, but it’s a very different
                    feeling from what I feel for you or Mauve. Pa cannot empathize or sympathize
                    with me, and I cannot settle in to Pa and Ma’s routine, it’s too constricting
                    for me — it would suffocate me.</p>
                <p>Whenever I tell Pa anything, it’s all just idle talk to him, and certainly no
                    less so to Ma, and I also find Pa and Ma’s sermons and ideas about God, people,
                    morality, virtue, almost complete nonsense. I also read the Bible sometimes,
                    just as I sometimes read Michelet or Balzac or Eliot, but I see completely
                    different things in the Bible than Pa sees, and I can’t agree at all with what
                    Pa makes of it in his petty, academic way. Since the Rev. Ten Kate translated
                    Goethe’s Faust, Pa and Ma have read that book, because now that a clergyman has
                    translated it, it can’t be all that immoral (??? what is that?). Yet they don’t
                    see anything in it but the catastrophic consequences of an unchaste love.</p>
                <p>And they certainly understand the Bible just as little. Take Mauve, for instance,
                    when he reads something deep he doesn’t immediately say, that man means this or
                    that. Because poetry is so deep and intangible that one can’t simply define it
                    all systematically, but Mauve has a refined sensibility and, you see, I find
                    that sensibility to be worth so much more than definition and criticism. And oh,
                    when I read, and I actually don’t read so much and even then, only
                    one-and-a-half writers, a couple of men whom I accidentally found, then I do so
                    because they look at things more broadly and milder and with more love than I
                    do, and are better acquainted with reality, and because I can learn something
                    from them. But all that drivel about good and evil, morality and immorality, I
                    actually care so little about it. For truly, it’s impossible for me always to
                    know what is good, what is evil, what is moral, what is immoral. Morality or
                    immorality coincidentally brings me to K.V. Ah! I’d written to you that it was
                    beginning to seem less and less like eating strawberries in the spring. Well,
                    that is of course true. If I should lapse into repetition, forgive me, I don’t
                    know if I’ve already written to you about what happened to me in Amsterdam. I
                    went there thinking, who knows whether the no, nay, never isn’t thawing, it’s
                    such mild weather. And so one evening I was making my way along Keizersgracht,
                    looking for the house, and indeed found it. And naturally I rang the bell and
                    heard that the family were still at table. But then I heard that I could come in
                    all the same. And there they were, including Jan, the very learned professor,
                    all of them except Kee. And they all still had a plate in front of them, and
                    there wasn’t a plate too many. This small detail caught my eye. They wanted to
                    make me think that Kee wasn’t there, and had taken away her plate, but I knew
                    she was there, I thought it so much like a comedy or game. </p>
                <p>After a while I asked (after chatting a bit and greeting everyone), But where’s
                    Kee? Then J.P.S. repeated my question, saying to his wife, Mother, where’s Kee?
                    And the missus said, Kee’s out. And for the time being I didn’t pursue the
                    matter but talked a bit with the professor about the exhibition at Arti he’d
                    just seen. Well, the professor disappeared and little Jan Vos disappeared, and
                    J.P.S. and the wife of the same and yours truly remained alone and got ourselves
                    into position. J.P.S., as priest and Father, started to speak and said he’d been
                    on the point of sending a certain letter to yours truly and he would read that
                    letter aloud. However, first I asked again, interrupting His Hon. or the Rev.,
                    Where’s Kee? (Because I knew she was in town.) Then J.P.S. said, Kee left the
                    house as soon as she heard you were here. Well, I know some things about her,
                    and I must say that I didn’t know then and still don’t know with certainty
                    whether her coldness and rudeness is a good or bad sign. This much I do know,
                    that I’ve never seen her so seemingly or actually cool and callous and rude
                    towards anyone but me. So I didn’t say much in reply and remained dead calm. Let
                    me hear that letter, I said, or not, I don’t really care either way. Then came
                    the epistle. The writing was reverent and very learned and so there wasn’t
                    really anything in it, though it did seem to say that I was being requested to
                    stop corresponding and I was given the advice to make vigorous attempts to
                    forget the matter. At last the reading of the letter was over. I felt exactly as
                    though I were hearing the minister in the church, after some raising and
                    lowering of his voice, saying amen – it left me just as cold as an ordinary
                    sermon. And then I began, and I said as calmly and politely as I could, well
                    yes, I’ve already heard this line of reasoning quite often, but now go on – and
                    after that? But then J.P.S. looked up... he even seemed to be somewhat amazed at
                    my not being completely convinced that we’d reached the extreme limit of the
                    human capacity to think and feel. There was, according to him, no ‘after that’
                    possible. We went on like this, and once in a while Aunt M. put in a very
                    Jesuitical word, and I got quite warm and finally lost my temper. And J.P.S.
                    lost his temper too, as much as a clergyman can lose his temper. And even though
                    he didn’t exactly say ‘God damn you’, anyone other than a clergyman in J.P.S.’s
                    mood would have expressed himself that way. But you know that I love both Pa and
                    J.P.S. in my own way, despite the fact that I truly loathe their system, and I
                    changed tack a bit and gave and took a bit, so that at the end of the evening
                    they said to me that if I wanted to stay at their house I could. Then I said,
                    thank you. If Kee walks out of the house when I come, then I don’t think it’s
                    the right moment to stay here, I’m going to my boarding-house. And then they
                    asked, where are you staying? I said, I don’t know yet, and then Uncle and Aunt
                    insisted on bringing me themselves to a good, inexpensive boarding-house. And
                    heavens, those two old dears came with me through the cold, misty, muddy
                    streets, and truly, they showed me a very good boarding-house and very
                    inexpensive. I didn’t want them to come at all but they insisted on showing
                    me.</p>
                <p> And, you see, I thought that rather humane of them and it calmed me down
                    somewhat. I stayed in Amsterdam two more days and talked with J.P.S. again, but
                    I didn’t see Kee, she made herself scarce each time. And I said that they ought
                    to know that although they wanted me to consider the matter over and done with,
                    I couldn’t bring myself to do it. And they continued to reply firmly: ‘Later on
                    I would understand it better’. Now and then I also saw the professor again, and
                    I have to say he wasn’t so bad, but – but – but – what else can I say about that
                    gentleman? I said I hoped that he might fall in love one day. Voilà. Can
                    professors fall in love? Do clergymen know what love is?</p>
                <p> I recently read Michelet, La femme, la religion et le prêtre. Books like that
                    are full of reality, yet what is more real than reality itself, and what has
                    more life than life itself? And we who do our best to live, why don’t we live
                    even more!</p>
                <p> I walked around aimlessly those three days in Amsterdam, I felt damned
                    miserable, and that half-kindness on the part of Uncle and Aunt and all those
                    arguments, I found them so tedious. Until I finally began to find myself tedious
                    and said to myself: would you like to become despondent again? And then I said
                    to myself, Don’t let yourself be overwhelmed. And so it was on a Sunday morning
                    that I last went to see J.P.S. and said to him, Listen, my dear Uncle, if Kee
                    Vos were an angel she would be too lofty for me, and I don’t think that I would
                    stay in love with an angel. Were she a devil, I wouldn’t want to have anything
                    to do with her. In the present case, I see in her a real woman, with womanly
                    passions and whims, and I love her dearly, that’s just the way it is, and I’m
                    glad of it. So long as she doesn’t become an angel or a devil, the case in
                    question isn’t over. And J.P.S. couldn’t say very much to that, and spoke
                    himself of womanly passions, I’m not really sure what he said about them, and
                    then J.P.S. left for the church. No wonder one becomes hardened and numb there,
                    I know that from my own experience. And so as far as your brother in question is
                    concerned, he didn’t want to let himself be overwhelmed. But that didn’t alter
                    the fact that he felt overwhelmed, that he felt as though he had been leaning
                    against a cold, hard, whitewashed church wall for too long. Oh well, should I
                    tell you more, old chap? It’s rather daring to remain a realist, but Theo, Theo,
                    you too are a realist, oh bear with my realism! I told you, even my secrets
                    aren’t necessarily secrets. Well, I won’t take those words back, think of me as
                    you will, and whether you approve or disapprove of what I did is less
                    important.</p>
                <p> I’ll continue – from Amsterdam I went to Haarlem and sat very agreeably with our
                    dear sister Willemien, and I took a walk with her, and in the evening I went to
                    The Hague, and I landed up at M.’s around seven o’clock. </p>
                <p>And I said: listen M., you were supposed to come to Etten to try and initiate me,
                    more or less, into the mysteries of the palette. But I’ve been thinking that
                    that wouldn’t be possible in only a couple of days, so now I’ve come to you and
                    if you approve I’ll stay four weeks or so, or six weeks or so, or as long or as
                    short as you like, and we’ll just have to see what we can do. It’s extremely
                    impertinent of me to demand so much of you, but in short, I’m under a great deal
                    of pressure. Well, Mauve said, do you have anything with you? Certainly, here
                    are a couple of studies, and he said many good things about them, far too many,
                    at the same time voicing some criticism, far too little. Well, and the next day
                    we set up a still life and he began by saying, This is how you should hold your
                    palette. And since then I’ve made a few painted studies and after that two
                    watercolours.</p>
                <p> This is a summary of my work, but there’s more to life than working with the
                    hands and the head.</p>
                <p>I remained chilled to the marrow, that’s to say to the marrow of my soul by that
                    aforementioned imaginary or not-imaginary church wall. And I didn’t want to let
                    myself be overwhelmed by that deadening feeling, I said. Then I thought to
                    myself, I’d like to be with a woman, I can’t live without love, without a woman.
                    I wouldn’t care a fig for life if there wasn’t something infinite, something
                    deep, something real. But, I said to myself in reply: you say ‘She and no other’
                    and should you go to a woman? But surely that’s unreasonable, surely that goes
                    against logic? <stress reason="love">And my answer to that was, Who’s the
                        master, logic or I</stress>? Is logic there for me or am I there for logic,
                    and is there no reason and no understanding in my unreasonableness or my
                    stupidity? And whether I act rightly or wrongly, I can’t do otherwise, that
                    damned wall is too cold for me, I’ll look for a woman, I cannot, I will not, I
                    may not live without love. I’m only human, and a human with passions at that, I
                    need a woman or I’ll freeze or turn to stone, or anyway be overwhelmed. In the
                    circumstances, however, I struggled much within myself, and in that struggle
                    some things concerning physical powers and health gained the upper hand, things
                    which I believe and know more or less through bitter experience. One doesn’t
                    live too long without a woman without going unpunished. And I don’t think that
                    what some call God and others the supreme being and others nature is
                    unreasonable and merciless, and, in a word, I came to the conclusion, I must see
                    whether I can’t find a woman. And heavens, I didn’t look so very far. I found a
                    woman, <stress reason="love">by no means young, by no means pretty, with nothing
                        special about her, if you will</stress>. But perhaps you’re rather curious.
                    She was fairly big and strongly built, she didn’t exactly have lady’s hands like
                    K.V. but those of a woman who works hard. But she was not coarse and not common,
                    and had something very feminine about her. She slightly resembled a nice figure
                    by Chardin or Frère or possibly Jan Steen. Anyhow, that which the French call ‘a
                    working woman’. She’d had a great many cares, one could see that, and life had
                    given her a drubbing, <stress reason="love">oh nothing distinguished, nothing
                        exceptional, nothing out of the ordinary</stress>.</p>

                <p> Every woman, at every age, if she loves and if she is kind, can give a man not
                    the infinite of the moment but the moment of the infinite.</p>

                <p> Theo, I find such infinite charm in that je ne sais quoi of withering, that
                    drubbed by life quality. Ah! <unstress reason="love">I found her to have a
                        charm</unstress>, I couldn’t help seeing in her something by Feyen-Perrin,
                    by Perugino. Look, I’m not exactly as innocent as a greenhorn, let alone a child
                    in the cradle. It’s not the first time I couldn’t resist that feeling of
                    affection, particularly love and affection for those women whom the clergymen
                    damn so and superciliously despise and condemn from the pulpit. I don’t damn
                    them, I don’t condemn them, I don’t despise them. Look, I’m almost thirty years
                    old, and do you think I’ve never felt the need for love?</p>
                <p>K.V. is older than I am, she also has love behind her, but she’s all the dearer
                    to me for that very reason. She’s not ignorant, but neither am I. If she wants
                    to subsist on an old love and if she wants to know nothing of new ones, that’s
                    her business, but the more she perseveres in that and avoids me, the more I
                    can’t just stifle my energy and strength of mind for her sake. No, I don’t want
                    that, I love her, but I don’t want to freeze and deaden my mind for her sake.
                    And the stimulus, the spark of fire we need, that is love and I don’t exactly
                    mean mystic love.</p>
                <p>That woman didn’t cheat me – oh, anyone who thinks all those sisters are
                    swindlers is so wrong and understands so little.</p>
                <p> That woman was <unstress reason="love">good to me, very good, very decent, very
                        sweet</unstress>. In what way? That I won’t repeat even to my brother Theo,
                    because I strongly suspect my brother Theo of having experienced something of
                    this himself now and then. The better for him.</p>
                <p>Did we spend a lot together? No, because I didn’t have much and I said to her,
                    listen, you and I don’t have to get drunk to feel something for one another,
                    just pocket what I can afford. And I wish I could have afforded more, because
                    she was worth it.</p>
                <p>And we talked about all kinds of things, about her life, about her cares, about
                    her destitution, about her health, and I had a livelier conversation with her
                    than with my learned professorial cousin Jan Stricker, for instance.</p>
                <p>I’ve actually told you these things because I hope you’ll see that even though I
                    perhaps have some feeling, I don’t want to be sentimental in a senseless way.
                    That, no matter what, I want to preserve some warmth of life and keep my mind
                    clear and my body healthy in order to work. And that I understand my love for
                    K.V. to be such that for her sake I don’t want to set about my work despondently
                    or let myself get upset.</p>
                <p> You’ll understand that, you who wrote in your letter something about the matter
                    of health. You talk of having been not quite healthy a while back, it’s very
                    good you’re trying to get yourself straightened out.</p>
                <p> Clergymen call us sinners, conceived and born in sin. Bah! I think that damned
                    nonsense. Is it a sin to love, to need love, not to be able to do without love?
                    I consider a life without love a sinful condition and an immoral condition. If
                    there’s anything I regret, <stress reason="environment"> it’s that for a time I
                        let mystical and theological profundities seduce me into withdrawing too
                        much inside myself</stress>. I’ve gradually stopped doing that. If you wake
                    up in the morning and you’re not alone and you see in the twilight a fellow
                    human being, it makes the world so much more agreeable. Much more agreeable than
                    the edifying journals and whitewashed church walls the clergymen are in love
                    with. It was a sober, simple little room she lived in, with a subdued, grey tone
                    because of the plain wallpaper and yet as warm as a painting by Chardin, a
                    wooden floor with a mat and an old piece of dark-red carpet, an ordinary kitchen
                    stove, a chest of drawers, a large, perfectly simple bed, in short, a real
                    working woman’s interior. She had to do the washing the next day. Just right,
                    very good, I would have found her just as charming in a purple jacket and a
                    black skirt as now in a brown or red-grey frock. And she was no longer young,
                    perhaps the same age as K.V., and she had a child, yes, life had given her a
                    drubbing and her youth was gone. Gone? – there is no such thing as an old woman.
                    Ah, and she was strong and healthy – and yet not rough, not common. Those who
                    value distinction so very highly, can they always tell what is distinguished?
                    Heavens! People sometimes look for it high and low when it’s close by, as I do
                    too now and then.</p>
                <p>I’m glad that I did what I did, because I think that nothing in the world should
                    keep me from my work or cause me to lose my good spirits. When I think of K.V.,
                    I still say ‘she and no other’, and I think exactly the same as I did last
                    summer about ‘meanwhile looking for another lass’. But it’s not only recently
                    that I’ve grown fond of those women who are condemned and despised and cursed by
                    clergymen, my love for them is even somewhat older than my love for Kee Vos.
                    Whenever I walked down the street – often all alone and at loose ends, half sick
                    and destitute, with no money in my pocket – I looked at them and envied the
                    people who could go off with her, and I felt as though those poor girls were my
                    sisters, as far as our circumstances and experience of life were concerned. And,
                    you see, <stress reason="environment">that feeling is old and deeply rooted in
                        me</stress>. Even as a boy I sometimes looked up with endless sympathy and
                    respect into a half-withered female face on which it was written, as it were:
                    life and reality have given me a drubbing. But my feelings for K.V. are
                    completely new and something entirely different. Without knowing it, <stress
                        reason="love">she’s in a kind of prison</stress>. She’s also poor and can’t
                    do everything she wants, and you see, she has a kind of resignation and I think
                    that the Jesuitisms of clergymen and devout ladies often make more of an
                    impression on her than on me, Jesuitisms that no longer impress me for the very
                    reason that I’ve learned a few tricks. But she adheres to them and couldn’t bear
                    it if the system of resignation and sin and God and whatnot appeared to be a
                    conceit. And I don’t think it occurs to her that perhaps God only actually
                    begins when we say those words with which Multatuli closes his prayer of an
                    unbeliever: ‘O God, there is no God’.</p>
                <p> Look, I find the clergymen’s God as dead as a doornail. But does that make me an
                    atheist? The clergymen think me one – be that as it may – but look, I love, and
                    how could I feel love if I myself weren’t alive and others weren’t alive? And if
                    we live, there’s something wondrous about it. Call it God or human nature or
                    what you will, but there’s a certain something that I can’t define in a system,
                    even though it’s very much alive and real, and you see, for me it’s God or just
                    as good as God. Look, if I must die in due course in one way or another, fine,
                    what would there be to keep me alive? Wouldn’t it be the thought of love (moral
                    or immoral love, what do I know about it?). And heavens, I love Kee Vos for a
                    thousand reasons, but precisely because I believe in life and in something real
                    I no longer become distracted as I used to when I had thoughts about God and
                    religion that were more or less similar to those Kee Vos now appears to have. I
                    won’t give her up, but that inner crisis she’s perhaps going through will take
                    time, and I have the patience for it, and nothing she says or does makes me
                    angry. But as long as she goes on being attached to the past and clinging to it,
                    I must work and keep my mind clear for painting and drawing and business. So I
                    did what I did, from a need for warmth of life and with an eye to health. I’m
                    also telling you these things so that you don’t get the idea again that I’m in a
                    melancholy or distracted, pensive mood. On the contrary, I’m usually pottering
                    about with and thinking about paint, making watercolours, looking for a studio
                    &amp;c. &amp;c. Old chap, if only I could find a suitable studio. </p>
                <p>Well, my letter has grown long, but anyway. I sometimes wish that the three
                    months between now and going back to M. were already over, but such as they’ll
                    be, they’ll bring some good. Write to me, though, now and then. Are you coming
                    again in the winter?</p>
                <p> And listen, renting a studio &amp;c., I’ll do it or I won’t, depending on what
                    Mauve thinks of it. I’m sending him the floor plan as agreed, and perhaps he’ll
                    come and have a look himself if necessary. But Pa has to stay out of it. Pa
                    isn’t the right man to get mixed up in artistic matters. And the less I have to
                    do with Pa in business matters, the better I’ll get along with Pa. But I have to
                    be free and independent in many things, that goes without saying.</p>
                <p>I sometimes shudder at the thought of K.V., seeing her dwelling on the past and
                    clinging to old, dead notions. There’s something fatal about it, and oh, she’d
                    be none the worse for changing her mind. I think it quite possible that her
                    reaction will come, there’s so much in her that’s healthy and lively. And so in
                    March I’ll go to The Hague again and – and – again to Amsterdam. But when I left
                    Amsterdam this time, I said to myself, under no circumstances should you become
                    melancholy and let yourself be overwhelmed so that your work suffers, especially
                    now that it’s beginning to progress. Eating strawberries in the spring, yes,
                    that’s part of life, but it’s only a short part of the year and it’s still a
                    long way off.</p>
                <p>And you should envy me because of this or that? Oh no, old chap, because what I’m
                    seeking can be found by all, by you perhaps sooner than by me. And oh, I’m so
                    backward and narrow-minded about so many things, if only I knew exactly why and
                    what I should do to improve. But unfortunately we often don’t see the beams in
                    our own eye. Do write to me soon, and you’ll just have to separate the wheat
                    from the chaff in my letters, if sometimes there’s something good in them,
                    something true, so much the better, but of course there’s much in them that’s
                    wrong, more or less, or perhaps exaggerated, without my always being aware of
                    it. I’m truly no scholar and am so extremely ignorant, oh, like many others and
                    even more than others, but I can’t gauge that myself, and I can gauge others
                    even less than I can gauge myself, and am often wide of the mark. But even as we
                    stray we sometimes find the track anyway, and <unstress reason="environment"
                        >there’s something good in all movement</unstress> (by the way, I happened
                    to hear Jules Breton say that and have remembered that utterance of his). Tell
                    me, have you ever heard Mauve preach?? I’ve heard him imitate several clergymen
                    – once he gave a sermon on Peter’s barque (the sermon was divided into 3 parts:
                    First, would he have bought it or inherited it? Second, would he have paid for
                    it in instalments or parts? Third, did he perhaps (banish the thought) steal
                    it?). Then he went on to preach on ‘the goodness of the Lord’ and on ‘the Tigris
                    and the Euphrates’ and finally he did an imitation of J.P.S., how he had married
                    A. and Lecomte.</p>
                <p>But when I told him that I had once said in a conversation with Pa that I
                    believed that one could say something edifying even in church, even from the
                    pulpit, M. said, Yes. And then he did an imitation of Father Bernhard: God – God
                    – is almighty – he created the sea, he created the earth and the sky and the
                    stars and the sun and the moon, he can do everything – everything – everything –
                    and yet – no, He’s not almighty, there’s one thing He cannot do. What is the one
                    thing that God Almighty cannot do? God Almighty cannot cast away a sinner. Well,
                    adieu, Theo, do write soon, in thought a handshake, believe me</p>

            <salutation>Dear brother, </salutation>
            <body>
                <p>As I’ve often done, I sent you an answer in my last letter that was brief and to
                    the point about one thing and another, yet in harsh words that nevertheless
                    truly express what I think about things, but you mustn’t think that<stress
                        reason="family"> I’m always in a gruff, cold-hearted mood which Mauve would
                        perhaps call a yellow soap mood or saltwater mood</stress>. But even if I
                    had written a yellow soap letter or a saltwater letter, <stress reason="family"
                        >surely that’s no worse than taking things too sentimentally</stress>. You
                    say, ‘you’ll truly regret it some day’. Old chap, I believe that I’ve had many
                    such regrets &amp;c. before now. I saw it coming and tried to nip it in the bud,
                    well that didn’t work, and anyway, what happened, happened. Will I now regret
                    it? No, actually I don’t have time for regrets. Drawing is becoming more and
                    more of a passion, and it’s just like a sailor’s passion for the sea. Mauve has
                    now shown me a new way to make something, namely watercolours. Well, now I’m
                    immersed in that, and I’m daubing and washing out, in short, seeking and
                    striving. For one must make desperate attempts.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="career">Because there’s something diabolical about the
                        execution of a watercolour.</unstress> Because there’s something good in all
                    energetic movement. So although I was planning to write to you in even more
                    detail about what happened at home, to try and explain how things stand from my
                    point of view, even though I also wanted to tell you this and that about other
                    subjects, I haven’t time for that now, and think it better to write to you again
                    about drawing. </p>
                <p>In addition to <work origin="new" stage="planned">a couple of small
                        watercolours</work>, I’ve just started <work origin="new" stage="planned">a
                        large one</work>, at least as large as <work origin="existing"
                        stage="finished">one of those figure studies I made at Etten</work>.
                    Naturally it doesn’t automatically go well and easily straightaway. Mauve
                    himself says that I’ll ruin at least 10 drawings or so before I know how to
                    handle the brush a little. But it will lead to a brighter future, so I work on
                    with as much cold-bloodedness as I can muster, and don’t let myself be deterred
                    by my mistakes. </p>

                <p>
                    <work origin="new" stage="middle">This is a little sketch of one of the small
                        watercolours</work>, it’s a corner of my studio with a girl grinding coffee.
                    You see I’m looking for tone, a head or a hand that glows, with life in it, and
                    that stands out against a drowsy background, twilit, and standing out boldly
                    against that, that fragment of fireplace and stove, iron and brick, and a wooden
                    floor. If I could get that drawing the way I’d like it, I’d make at least 3/4 of
                    it in yellow soap style and treat only that corner where the child is sitting
                    delicately and tenderly and with sentiment. But you understand that I still
                    can’t express all of that as I feel it, but it seems to me the point is simply
                    to attack the difficulties, and the yellow soap passage still isn’t yellow soapy
                    enough and the contrasting tenderness still not tender enough. But anyway, the
                    sketch is still chucked on and its conception is clear, and to me it seems
                    fairly good. Of course one can’t master the technique the first day. </p>


                <p>This is the subject of the large drawing, <stress reason="career">but I’m doing
                        it in a hurry and the sketch is terrible</stress>. Even so, perhaps it gives
                    you an idea, and in any case it’s already on paper. I hear that someone called
                    on me today, Mr Tersteeg, I think. I hope so, because he promised me he’d stop
                    by, and I wanted to discuss some things with him. He’s supposed to be coming
                    back tomorrow morning. Theo, I’m having a lot of trouble with the models, I
                    search for them and when I find them it’s a struggle to get them to come to my
                    studio, and sometimes they let me down. Like a smith’s boy this morning, who
                    couldn’t come because his father said that I had to pay a guilder an hour, and
                    of course I wasn’t inclined to do that. Tomorrow I have the little old woman as
                    a model again, but she couldn’t come for 3 days running. Well then, when I go
                    out, I quite often go to sketch in the soup kitchen or the 3rd-class waiting
                    room or such places. <stress reason="environment">But it’s so damned cold
                        outdoors</stress>, especially for me, since I don’t yet draw as fast as more
                    practised draughtsmen, and actually have to work my drawings out in more detail
                    for them to be of any use to me. </p>
                <p>So you see I’m not standing still and am no longer dwelling on Etten, but am
                    trying to put down roots here. <stress reason="money">Naturally the models cost
                        me money, and I must tell you that I buy what’s necessary for myself, though
                        the cheapest possible. (I go to the soup kitchen to eat.) </stress>And yet I
                    trust you won’t have any objections to my continuing. But I repeat what I said
                    in my last letter: let me know as precisely as possible where I stand, and I
                    think it would be fine if you could come to an agreement with Mr Tersteeg, so
                    that in case of difficulty I can go to him without too many misgivings. For my
                    part I promise you that I’ll work as much as I can, though things like models
                    often depend on the money I do or don’t have in my pocket, whether I can set to
                    work at full speed, half speed or sometimes not at all. Now, for instance, I’m
                    negotiating with a mother with a little child, though <stress reason="money">
                        I’m afraid it will turn out to be too expensive for me</stress>. Be assured
                    that I’d prefer to go full speed but... anyway, you understand it all, <stress
                        reason="money">I have to restrain myself until I have more resources and
                        freedom</stress>. Write to me again soon, and listen, send the money as soon
                    as possible in February, because I’m sure I won’t have a penny by then. I’m
                    planning to go on making small pen drawings whenever possible, but different
                    from the large ones I made this summer. A bit sharper and a bit angrier. <work

            <salutation> My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Even though I’m rather expecting a letter from you one of these days, I’ll write
                    again anyway. I heard a few things about you from Mr Tersteeg when he returned
                    from Paris. He told me that you were doing well, and he seemed to be rather
                    pleased with his trip. When I went to see him I had a couple of drawings, and he
                    said that they were better than the last ones and told me that I should again
                    make a couple of small ones. I’m working on those now. And I’ve also been <work
                        origin="new" stage="middle">working on a new pen drawing of an old woman
                        knitting</work>. And I believe <unstress reason="career">it’s better than
                        last summer’s, at least it has more tone</unstress>. When I have a couple of
                    pen drawings that have turned out quite well, I believe I know an art lover who
                    will take them. I also wrote to C.M. the other day to say I’d rented a studio
                    here, and hoped that when he came to The Hague he’d let me know, or come and
                    have a look. Uncle Cent also told me last summer that if I have a drawing, a
                    little smaller than those of last summer and with more watercolour, I should
                    simply send it and he would take it. Perhaps the time will soon come when my
                    work will put some money in my pocket, which I’m badly in need of, precisely in
                    order to tackle things more seriously. </p>
                <p>If you can find out about it, you must tell me what kind of drawings one might be
                    able to sell to the illustrated magazines. It seems to me they could use pen
                    drawings of types of the people, and I’d like so much to start working on them,
                    in order to make something suitable for reproduction. I don’t think that all
                    drawings are drawn directly on the blocks, there must be some means of getting a
                    facsimile onto the block. Though I don’t rightly know. Sometimes I long so very
                    much to see you and talk to you, will it be a long time before you come to
                    Holland? I believe Pa half expected you to come for his birthday. I was very
                    glad that Mr Tersteeg found the drawings a little better, well, I’m also
                    beginning to feel more at home with my model, and that’s precisely the reason
                    why I must continue with her now. In the last two studies I captured the
                    character much better, everyone who saw them said so. <unstress
                        reason="friendship">At the moment I quite often go to draw with Breitner, a
                        young painter who’s acquainted with Rochussen as I am with Mauve</unstress>.
                    He draws very skilfully and very differently from me, and we often draw types
                    together in the soup kitchen or the waiting room &amp;c. He sometimes comes to
                    my studio to look at woodcuts, and I go to see the ones he has as well. He has
                    the studio that Apol used to have at Siebenhaar’s. </p>
                <p>Last week I went to an art viewing at Pulchri which had sketches by Bosboom and
                    Henkes. Very beautiful; there were a number of drawings by Henkes, larger
                    figures than one usually sees from him. He ought to make more of them, I think.
                    Weissenbruch also came to see me. I<unstress reason="friendship"> look forward
                        every day to a letter from you, because I hope you’ll send me something one
                        of these days</unstress>. We must stick it out for a while, old chap, and
                    persevere, you as well as I, and then we’ll both get pleasure from it sometime.
                    I’m really very glad that I’ve gone on with the figure so far. If I’d been
                    making only landscapes, perhaps I’d already be making something that would fetch
                    a price, but later on I’d end up getting stuck anyway. Although the figure is
                    more difficult and a more complicated matter, I believe it’s more solid in the
                    long run. De Bock came here this afternoon just as I was working from the model,
                    and when he saw the model he started saying that he’d quite like to draw figures
                    too; all the same, he doesn’t do it. He recently made a beautiful drawing,
                    though. </p>
                <p>In your last letter you told me something about the matter of your not being able
                    to have any money before the inventory was finished. But if you don’t have it,
                    be so good as to write to Mr Tersteeg about it immediately, because I have only
                    three guilders or so left and it’s already nearly the middle of February. So at
                    all events I’m expecting a letter from you any day now. I believe that I’ve got
                    the proportions much better in my <work mention="unnamed"> last drawings</work>
                    than in the <work mention="unnnamed">previous ones</work>, and that’s exactly
                    what seemed to me to be the worst fault in<work mention="unnamed"> my drawings
                        up to now</work>, but that’s changing, thank God, and then I won’t be afraid
                    of anything. Adieu Theo, write soon, accept in thought a hearty handshake.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>I received your last letter with the 100 francs enclosed in good order, and I
                    sincerely thank you for sending it. I’d have sent you news of its safe receipt
                    immediately, but I’ve been very busy with a <work mention="unnamed">couple of
                        drawings</work> for which I had a model. For I’ll have you know that if
                    you’re busy, so am I, and will be so more and more, because I’m getting more of
                    an eye for my work, and so can tear myself away from it only with a great effort
                    in order to write or to go and visit someone if necessary. <unstress
                        reason="friendship">What made me happy was that you write that you may be
                        coming to Holland soon</unstress>. When you’ve seen what I’ve been doing
                    recently, perhaps we’ll have a better idea of the future. When you come, I hope
                    we’ll have some quiet time together in the studio, and I also hope that you’ll
                    write to me in advance, so that I can arrange with the model not to come during
                    the days of your visit.</p>
                <p>You write about Pa’s birthday, I must say that I feel so good to have done with
                    everything, it’s such a tranquillity, which I need so much in my work, my head
                    can’t hold more than it does. And now I dread starting up a new correspondence,
                    so much so that I’m quietly leaving things as they are for the present. <stress
                        reason="career">When I was still at home I worried about it, but now that
                        things have come to this, what can one do</stress>? Ignore everything and
                    pretend that nothing happened – Pa and Ma might be able to do that, but I can’t
                    – I feel that, sadly, something did in fact happen. When I think of Etten, a
                    kind of shiver runs down my body as though I were in a church. In short, what
                    can be done, and again, what can be done?</p>
                <p>Besides, you mustn’t blame me, Theo, or think that I’m carping, but you wrote
                    something to me which you perhaps thought would make me happy, but it didn’t
                    make me happy. You said that that <work mention="unnamed">small watercolour
                    </work>is the best thing of mine you’ve seen – well, that isn’t true, because
                    those studies of mine you have are much better, and the pen drawings of last
                    summer are also better, because that little drawing means nothing; anyhow, I
                    only sent it to you to show that my working with watercolour at some point
                    wasn’t an impossibility. But there’s much more serious study and more substance
                    in those other things, despite the fact that they still look yellow-soap-like.
                    And if I had something against Mr Tersteeg (but I don’t have anything against
                    him), then it would be the same thing. Namely that he encourages me not to
                    undertake difficult study from a model but rather to adopt a procedure that’s
                    actually only half suited to the rendering of what I want to express, according
                    to my own character and according to my own temperament. It goes without saying
                    that I’d be very happy to sell a drawing, but it makes me much happier if a true
                    artist like Weissenbruch says of an unsaleable (???) study or drawing, that’s
                    faithful and I’d be able to work from that. You see, although I place great
                    value on money, especially now, still, for me the No. 1 thing is to make
                    something that’s reasonable. Well, something like what Weissenbruch said of a
                    landscape, a peat moor, Mauve said it of a figure, namely an old peasant sitting
                    by the fireplace, thinking or daydreaming, as though seeing things from the
                    distant past taking shape in the glow of the fire or the smoke. It may take a
                    longer or shorter time, but the way is really to penetrate deeply into nature.
                    To be true is what remains, says Gavarni. One may be caught up for a time in
                    petty pecuniary vexations, but one will surmount them, and the drawings that
                    were rejected earlier will then be sold. </p>
                <p>I’ve written to C.M. to tell him that I’d taken a studio here, and he wrote back
                    saying that he expected to be coming to The Hague soon and would come and visit
                    me. Recently I was also given regards from my old friend Wisselingh from London,
                    who’s also supposed to come, and he was glad that I was working. Well, I hope
                    you’ll succeed in escaping, because I’m longing to see you. I think that when
                    you’ve seen my recent studies you’ll agree completely with my taking a model
                    regularly. The better I get to know the models, the better I can draw them, of
                    course. And I’ve been rather lucky in finding models. Today, now as I’m writing
                    to you, I have a child that has to rest once in a while for half an hour, and
                    I’m using that half-hour for this letter. Thanks again for what you sent, and a
                    handshake in thought, adieu,</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo. </salutation>
            <body>
                <p>You’ll perhaps find it rather harsh, what I wrote to you about Tersteeg. By no
                    means do I take it back, though. Tersteeg is someone who is extremely hard of
                    hearing, though I don’t consider him deaf. He must be told things very
                    decidedly, otherwise it doesn’t penetrate his armour. <stress reason="career"
                        >For years he’s thought me a kind of blockhead and dreamer, he still views
                        me as such, and even says about my drawings: that’s a kind of opium daze you
                        administer to yourself so as not to feel the pain you suffer at not being
                        able to make watercolours. Now then, that’s very cleverly put, but that
                        expression is actually ill-considered, superficial and doesn’t hold
                        water</stress> (the main reason I can’t make watercolours straightaway is
                    that I must draw more seriously and pay attention to proportion and
                    perspective). Similarly, Mr T.’s ‘practical talks’ (say) on art couldn’t be more
                    impracticable. It doesn’t help him even if he uses as arguments some things that
                    could be called conversation killers, because it’s difficult to find an answer
                    to them. Enough – I don’t deserve his reproaches, and if my drawings don’t amuse
                    His Hon. neither does it amuse me to show them to His Hon. like that. </p>
                <p>He condemns drawings of mine which contain much that is good, and I hadn’t
                    expected that of His Hon. If I make serious studies from a model it’s a lot more
                    practical than his practical talks about saleability or unsaleability, about
                    which I – having dealt in paintings and drawings myself, for that matter – don’t
                    need to be enlightened by His Hon. to the extent that he thinks. I’d prefer,
                    then, to lose his friendship than agree with him about this.</p>
                <p>Although at times I’m overwhelmed by worries, all the same, I’m calm, and my
                    calmness is based on my serious approach to my work and on reflection. Although
                    I have moments of passion,<stress reason="career"> and my disposition tends to
                        make them worse</stress>, nonetheless I’m composed, as His Hon., who’s known
                    me long enough, very well knows. Now he even said to me: you have too much
                    patience. <stress reason="career">Those words aren’t right, one can’t have too
                        much patience in art, that word is beyond the pale. Perhaps in my case Mr
                        H.G.T. has too little patience. Now he must see, once and for all, that I’m
                        setting to work seriously and won’t let myself be forced into sending work
                        into the world that doesn’t bear the stamp of my own character.</stress> My
                    own character is beginning to emerge particularly in my last drawings???
                    studies???, which Tersteeg rejected. </p>
                <p>Perhaps – perhaps I’d succeed even now in making something in the genre of
                    watercolour that could perhaps be sold with a great deal of effort. But that
                    would be forcing watercolours to grow in the hothouse. Tersteeg and you must
                    wait for the natural season, and it hasn’t arrived yet. He spoke English when he
                    was here because of the model. I said to him: in due time you shall have your
                    watercolours, now you can’t – they are not due yet. Take your time. And I’m
                    sticking to that. Enough. Since T.’s visit I’ve made a <work origin="new"
                        stage="finished">drawing of an orphan boy polishing shoes</work>. It might
                    have been done with a hand that doesn’t exactly obey my will yet, but even so it
                    contains the type of that orphan boy. And no matter how clumsy my hand, that
                    hand will still have to end up doing what my head wants. So I’ve made a study of
                    the studio with the stove, the fireplace, easel, tabouret, table &amp;c., of
                    course not exactly saleable just now, but very good for putting perspective into
                    practice. I’m longing for you to come, you have quite a lot to see, which I’ve
                    made since your visit last summer. Theo, I’m counting on your looking at my work
                    with sympathy and with confidence, and not with two minds or dissatisfaction.
                    Tersteeg thinks, because I work so much, that it’s easy, that’s where he’s also
                    mistaken. But I’m actually a drudge or a draught ox. </p>
                <p>If you come, would you be sure and think of the Ingres paper? It’s the thick one
                    in particular that I like to work on, and it seems to me it must lend itself
                    even to studies in watercolour. Believe me that in artistic matters the words
                    hold true: Honesty is the best policy. Better to put a bit more effort into
                    serious study than being stylish to win over the public. Occasionally, in times
                    of worry, I’ve longed to be stylish, but on second thoughts I say no – just let
                    me be myself – and express severe, rough, yet true things with rough
                    workmanship. I won’t run after the art lovers or dealers, let those who are
                    interested come to me. In due time we shall reap if we faint not.</p>
                <p>Oh well. Listen, Theo, what a man that Millet was! I have the big work by Sensier
                    on loan from De Bock. It interests me so much that I wake up at night and light
                    the lamp and go on reading. Because during the day I have to work. Do send me
                    something soon if it’s at all possible. I wish that for once Tersteeg had to
                    face a week of doing what I do on what I have to spend, he’d notice that it’s
                    not dozing or dreaming or an opium daze, but that one has to be wide awake to
                    combat the many difficulties that crop up. Nor is it easy to find models and to
                    get them to pose. Most painters are driven to desperation by it. Especially when
                    one has to scrimp – go short of – food, drink, clothing in order to pay them.
                    Well, Tersteeg is Tersteeg and I am I. Nonetheless, rest assured, I’m not
                        <stress reason="career">opposed to, i.e. hostile towards him, but I must
                        make him understand that he judges me too superficially and – and – I
                        believe that he’ll change his mind – I sincerely hope so, because being at
                        odds with His Hon</stress>. pains me very much and makes life difficult for
                    me. I hope your letter comes soon – <stress reason="money">my last pennies are
                        for posting this letter</stress>. It’s only been a few days since I received
                    the 10 guilders from Tersteeg, but that same day I had to pay 6 guilders of it
                    to the model, to the baker, to the girl who sweeps the studio. Adieu, I wish you
                    health and good cheer, in spite of everything <good_health>I’m not without good
                        cheer either</good_health>.</p>

            <ps>
                <p>I had a very pleasant visit from Jules Bakhuyzen, and I may go and visit him
                    whenever I wish.</p>

                <p>Here you have a few words that struck me and moved me in Sensier’s Millet,
                    sayings of Millet. Art is a battle – you have to put your whole life into art.
                    One must work like a bunch of negroes.</p>
                <p>I’d rather say nothing than express myself weakly. It was only yesterday that I
                    read that last saying of Millet, but I’d felt the same before then, which is why
                    I sometimes feel the need to scratch in what I feel not with a soft brush but a
                    hard carpenter’s pencil and a pen. Watch out! Tersteeg! Watch out! You’re
                    clearly wrong. </p>


                <p>Theo, it’s almost miraculous!!!</p>
                <p>First of all, a message arrives that I must go and fetch your letter. Secondly,
                    C.M. comes, orders 12 small pen drawings from me, views of The Hague, having
                    seen a few that were finished (Paddemoes. The Geest district – Vleersteeg were
                    finished) for a rijksdaalder apiece, the price set by me. With the promise that
                    if I make them to his liking he’ll order 12 more, but for which he’ll fix the
                    price higher than I do. Thirdly, I run into Mauve, successfully delivered of his
                    large painting, promises to come by soon. So, it’s fine – it’s going well –
                    it’ll get even better! And something else moved me, and moved me deeply – I’d
                    said that the model didn’t have to come today – I hadn’t said why – but the poor
                    woman came anyway and I protested. Yes, but I’m not coming to be drawn, I’m just
                    coming to make sure you’ve got something to eat – she had a portion of string
                    beans and potatoes with her. There are indeed things in life that are worth the
                    effort.</p>

            </head>
            <salutation>My dear Theo, </salutation>
            <body>
                <p>It shouldn’t surprise you that I wrote to you: become a painter. For I myself am
                    now in a period in which I’m deriving some benefit from my earlier worries.
                    Because as things are now, every week I make one thing or another that I
                    couldn’t make before, and that’s what I spoke about, that it’s as though one
                    were young again. And it’s the awareness that nothing – <bad_health>(except
                        sickness)</bad_health> can rob me of the strength that’s now beginning to
                    develop, <unstress reason="environment">it’s that awareness that gives me faith
                        in the future and enables me to bear many unpleasantnesses in the present.
                        It’s a wonderful thing to look at something and find it beautiful, to
                        reflect on it and hold it fast and then to say: I’m going to draw that, and
                        then to work on it until it’s done</unstress>. Obviously that’s why I’m not
                    yet content with my work to the extent that I think I needn’t do it any better.
                    But the way to do it better later is to do it as well as one can today, there
                    can’t be anything but progress tomorrow. Naturally I don’t know what you’ll
                    think of my drawings when you finally see them, but this much I do know, I’m
                    greatly longing for you to come. </p>
                <p>And if I write to you, become a painter, then it really isn’t because I think
                    that in your present position there isn’t a very great deal that’s beautiful.
                        <unstress reason="career">But I find being a painter more
                        beautiful</unstress>, and I wish you worked in your own studio instead of at
                    a reading-desk in the office. There you have it. I know for certain that
                    something would awaken in you in your own studio which you don’t know of now – a
                    huge, hidden force of working and creating. And once it’s awake, it’s awake for
                    good. When I hear Tersteeg talking about agreeableness and saleability I can
                    only think: work one has slaved away at and done one’s best to imbue with
                    character and sentiment can be neither disagreeable nor unsaleable. And perhaps
                    it’s better that one doesn’t immediately please everyone. <unstress
                        reason="environment">What wonderful weather we’re having – there’s spring in
                        everything. I can’t let go of the figure, for that’s No. 1 for me, but
                        sometimes I can’t keep myself from going outdoors.</unstress> But I’m busy
                    with difficult things that I can’t let slide. Recently I’ve been making many
                    studies of parts of the figure: heads, neck, breast, shoulder. See the enclosed
                    scratch. I’d very much like to make more studies of the nude. You know <work
                        origin="existing" stage="finished">I’ve drawn the Exercices au fusain,
                        several times eve</work>n, but they don’t include any female figures. </p>
                <p>Of course, doing it from life is something entirely different. <work
                        origin="existing" stage="finished">A little drawing like the enclosed</work>
                    is simple enough in line, but it’s difficult enough to capture those simple,
                    characteristic lines when one is sitting in front of the model. Those lines are
                    now so simple that one can outline them with the pen, but I repeat, the problem
                    is finding those broad outlines, so that one can say what’s essential with a
                    couple of strokes or scratches. Choosing the lines in such a way that it’s
                    obvious, as it were, that they must run thus, that’s something that isn’t
                    obvious, however. It’s true, Theo, that recently, since I’ve been in The Hague,
                    I’ve spent more than 100 francs a month, but if I didn’t do that, I couldn’t
                    work with a model, and would remain at the same level, making no progress. I see
                    this in other painters: Breitner, for example. They’re afraid to take a model
                    regularly, and they work little and slowly – if only it were good anyway, but it
                    isn’t even that. Breitner had been taking a model again lately, though, and
                    there was of course more spirit in his work, but then he fell ill. The English
                    painters, certainly the draughtsmen for The Graphic &amp;c., have a model nearly
                    every day. Without that it really doesn’t work, in my opinion. If someone with
                    many years of experience draws figures from the imagination after a great deal
                    of study, fine, but to work systematically from the imagination seems overly
                    rash to me. Israëls and Blommers and Neuhuys don’t do that, even though they
                    have so much experience. </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="money">If I’ve spent more than 100 francs a month here, it’s
                        because it’s not possible to spend less. And believe me, I don’t throw it
                        around rashly or too freely. I do wish I didn’t have to give Tersteeg the 25
                        guilders back yet, because I really need the money to be able to go on
                        working energetically. </stress>Tersteeg is none the poorer by it, and in
                    the beginning he himself said that I needn’t worry about it. Even though every
                    25 guilders less means that my work suffers and that I can’t do what really
                    needs to be done. If I fill my portfolios with studies I’ll get my money’s worth
                    out of them later. And I’d rather earn a bit more later than now. I’d rather see
                    to it that I’m equal to my profession than rush to sell a drawing by the grace
                    of God. The <work origin="existing" stage="finished">enclosed drawing was
                        scratched after a larger study which has a more sombre expression</work>.
                    There’s a poem by Tom Hood, I believe, in which he tells of a great lady who
                    can’t sleep at night because during the day, when she went out to buy a frock,
                    she saw the poor seamstresses pale, consumptive, emaciated, working in an
                    airless room. And now she has twinges of remorse about her wealth and wakes up
                    at night in panic. In short, it’s a slender, white female figure, restless in
                    the dark night. If I must, I’ll talk no more about it and give Tersteeg the 25
                    guilders when you send money again, but if it could be arranged, I’d prefer to
                    wait until he takes a drawing for it later, because now I definitely need as
                    much money as I can possibly spare for my studies. Anyway, it seems to me that
                    Tersteeg won’t be so severe as not to understand that at the moment 25 guilders
                    are worth more to me than they are to His Hon. Well, I wish you well, and
                    remember, I hope you’re working in your own studio in the near future. It
                    needn’t happen too quickly – but I believe that after a relatively short time of
                    worry, you’d be happier once and for all. Adieu. </p>

                <p>P.S. I don’t have many studies of the nude yet, but there are some that bear a
                    very close resemblance to the Bargues, are they therefore less original? Perhaps
                    it’s because I learned to look at nature through the Bargues. </p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo, </salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Today <work origin="existing" stage="finished">I sent you 1 drawing by
                        post</work> which I’m sending to you as a<unstress reason="friendship">
                        token of gratitude </unstress>for so much that you’ve done for me during
                    this otherwise hard winter. Last summer, when you had that large woodcut by
                    Millet, ‘the shepherdess’, I thought: how much one can do with one single line!
                    Naturally I don’t presume to say as much as Millet with a single outline. But
                    I’ve nevertheless tried to put some sentiment into this figure. Now I only hope
                    that this figure is to your liking. And now you see at the same time that I’m
                    hard at work. Now that I’ve started, I’d like to make around 30 studies of the
                    nude. The <work origin="existing" stage="finished"> enclosed is, I think, the
                        best figure I’ve drawn</work>, that’s why I thought I’d send it to you.</p>
                <p>This isn’t the study from the model and yet it’s directly from the model. You
                    should know that I had two sheets underneath my paper. Well, I’d toiled to get
                    the outlines right and when I took the drawing off the plank it was very cleanly
                    impressed on the two underlying sheets and then I immediately worked it up after
                    the first study, so that this one is even fresher than the first. I’ve kept the
                    other two and wouldn’t like to part with them. At the same time you’ll see from
                    this that it isn’t without reason that I wrote to you that I wished the money
                    for H.G.T. could wait, I need it so much myself now, and working hard with a
                    model seems to me to be the quickest way of getting right on top of it. The
                    model I have isn’t at all expensive, but because the expense recurs day after
                    day it’s often difficult for me to pay it. Anyway, arrange it as best you can,
                    but if it’s convenient for you, send what you spoke of not too late in the
                    month. Adieu, with a handshake. </p>

                <p>It seems to me that this drawing would do well in a simple grey mount.</p>



                <p>Naturally I don’t always draw like this. But I’m extremely fond of those English
                    drawings that are done in this style, so it’s no wonder that I tried to do the
                    same for once, and because it was for you, who understands these things, <stress

            <salutation>My dear Theo, </salutation>
            <body>
                <p> My reply to your statement, ‘Tersteeg has been almost like an elder brother to
                    us, be sure and stay friends with him’, whereupon I said that even if that were
                    so as far as you were concerned, I personally had been confronted with his
                    unfriendly and hard side for years – I’d like to elaborate on this a little. In
                    all those years between the time I both handed in and was given my notice at
                    Goupil’s and the moment I finally started to draw (which – and I admit that this
                    was a mistake on my part – I should have done straightaway), in those years,
                    when I was abroad without friends or assistance, in great misery (<stress
                        reason="money">so that I often had to sleep in the streets in London, and in
                        the Borinage 3 nights in a row</stress>), did he ever give me a piece of
                    bread? Did he ever put courage into me, he who had known me for donkey’s years,
                    or give me fresh heart when I’d nearly given up? <stress reason="career">I think
                        not. Did he ever help me with this or that – no. Except for lending me the
                        Bargues, after I had literally begged him for them no less than 4 times.
                        When I sent him my first drawings he sent me a box of paints – but no money
                        at all.</stress> I’m willing to believe that those first drawings weren’t
                    worth anything, but look, someone like Tersteeg could have thought, I’ve known
                    him for such a long time and I want to help him out, and he could have
                    understood that I was so badly in need of it and do indeed have to eat. When I
                    wrote to him from Brussels, ‘wouldn’t it be possible for me to work for a while
                    in The Hague and mix with painters?’, he tried to fob me off and wrote to me, oh
                    no, surely not, you’ve lost your rights. I’d do better to go and teach English
                    and French. <stress reason="career">Of this he was certain: I was no
                        artist</stress>. Or do copying work for Smeeton and Tilly, which wasn’t
                    exactly near by, and I was turned down by various lithographers in Brussels:
                        <stress reason="friendship">there wasn’t any work, there was nothing doing,
                        that’s what they said. When I showed him some drawings again last summer, he
                        said: I hadn’t expected this – but he didn’t help me, and wasn’t at all
                        inclined to take back what he’d said.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>When I came to The Hague anyway, without asking His Hon.’s advice, he tried to
                    trip me up, <stress reason="friendship">I heard that he laughed at my becoming a
                        painter, I noticed that until then Mauve had considered me ‘a bloody
                        bore’</stress>, and Mauve was amazed that I was a different person from the
                    one he’d heard about. I didn’t ask Mauve for money, but Mauve said of his own
                    accord, you need money, I’ll make sure you earn some – you can count on your bad
                    years being over and on the sun rising for you, you’ve worked for it and earned
                    it honestly. And, to begin with, Mauve helped me to settle in. But all of that
                    changed – Mauve’s sympathy, which was to me as water to a half-withered plant,
                    dried up. Because Tersteeg whispered something venomous in Mauve’s ear: Watch
                    out – he can’t be trusted with money – drop him – don’t help him any more – as
                    an art dealer I don’t see any point in it – or at any rate something in this
                    vein. And pretended to know nothing when I said: Tersteeg, you must tone down
                    your talk a bit; he said nothing. I was just imagining it, he said. <stress
                        reason="friendship">Until one fine day he threatened me: Mauve and I will
                        see to it that you receive no more money from Theo.... I no longer doubted
                        it, and thought, you’re betraying me. Because I knew what Mauve himself had
                        said to me about it, namely that it would be very good if I could continue
                        to receive that money from you for at least another year. When one forsakes
                        someone in the winter, and even tries to rob him of his bread, is that
                        coercion or not....?</stress>
                </p>
                <p> It’s inconsiderate, insensitive, those aren’t manners, it’s not humane. And who
                    am I – someone with difficult, painstaking work that demands peace and quiet and
                    some sympathy, otherwise my work is impossible. Theo, think about these things
                    and write to me soon. <bad_health>Even though I was terribly
                        grieved</bad_health> that Mauve left me in the lurch, I’ve battled on this
                    winter as best I could. <bad_health>But is it any wonder that I’m shaken by it
                        and sometimes feel as though my heart is failing? </bad_health>The likes of
                    Tersteeg ‘laugh’ about it – but you are my brother and I hope you won’t laugh
                    about it.</p>
                <p>I have more to tell you about my plans for the future, how I intend to continue
                    my work. You must come here first, though, so I’m not writing about that now,
                    seeing as you won’t, I hope, be staying away very much longer. You’ve seen the
                        <work mention="vague">two drawings</work> I sent you. They didn’t turn out
                    like that by chance; I could deliver such work regularly and it will gradually
                    get better. So it’s not unreasonable for me to urge you to arrange it so that I
                    no longer have to fear that the most necessary things will be taken from me, or
                    always have the feeling that it’s charity. </p>
                <p>The most necessary things are bread, clothing, rent, models, drawing materials.
                    And it’s not such a tremendous amount, the way I go about it – and I can make
                    drawings in return, provided someone wants them.<stress reason="money"> I don’t
                        desire wealth, but of course I can’t stand the thought of not having the
                        most necessary things. A workman is worth his wages. I wish it could be
                        arranged for me to receive the money weekly, because it’s so difficult to
                        calculate a month ahead. If Tersteeg takes back the most awful things he
                        said, I’m willing to assume that he said them in a moment of
                        thoughtlessness, and then it’s forgive and forget. If he stands by them,
                        I’ll consider him an enemy who can’t stand the sight of me, rather than a
                        friend. Don’t blame me, Theo, for bothering you with this, but it’s been
                        going on now the whole winter, and what have I done to deserve all this
                        frustration? </stress>All that fear and sorrow cannot but make one agitated
                    and nervous in speech and manner, and if Mauve imitates and parrots me, saying
                    ‘that’s the face you pull’, this is how you talk, I’ll reply: My dear fellow, if
                    you had spent damp nights in the streets of London or cold nights in the
                    Borinage as I have done, hungry, roofless, feverish, perhaps you’d also have the
                    occasional ugly tic, and something in your voice, to show for it. Adieu, Theo,
                    with a handshake.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Today, Saturday, I had a visit from Rappard, and I’m glad that now he has been
                    here. He also asked after you with great interest. He saw <work mention="vague"
                        >the drawings</work> I’m doing for C.M. among other things, and they seem to
                    please him, especially a large one of the courtyard or back yard at the house
                    where Sien’s mother lives. I would like you to see that one, as well as another
                    of a carpenter’s shed and yard with small figures at work. The perspective is
                    rather more complicated than in the Laan van Meerdervoort I sent you, and I’ve
                    laboured long and hard on it. I must tell you that these days I’m already out of
                    doors by 4 o’clock in the morning, because during the day it’s too difficult to
                    be on the street on account of the passers-by and the urchins, and because
                    that’s the best time to see the broad outlines while things still have tone.
                    But, old chap, this has been an anxious fortnight for me. When I wrote to you
                    around the middle of May, all I had left was 3 or 3.50 guilders after paying the
                    baker. I had practically nothing else to eat but dry black bread with a little
                    coffee, and Sien too. Because we’d bought linen for her baby and she’d been to
                    Leiden &amp;c. </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="money">The rent is due on 1 June, and I have nothing, literally
                        nothing.</stress> I hope you’ll send something. <bad_health>A week ago I was
                        terribly weak due to constant sleeplessness</bad_health>. But now I’m making
                    good progress with<work origin="new" stage="middle"> several drawings</work>, so
                    that the order for C.M. is well advanced, and as a result I’m in better
                        spirits,<good_health> I’m somewhat calmer again</good_health>. Still, old
                    chap, write to me soon and save me from the landlord, because, as you know,
                    their kind brook no delay. <unstress reason="friendship">Rappard’s visit cheered
                        me up</unstress>; he seems to be working hard. He gave me 2.50 guilders
                    because he saw a tear in a drawing and said, you should have that repaired. I
                    know, I said,<stress reason="money"> but I haven’t got the money and the drawing
                        must be sent off.</stress> Then he said straightaway that he’d be glad to
                    give it to me, and I could have had more but I didn’t want to, and I gave him a
                    pile of woodcuts and a drawing in return. It was one of those meant for C.M.,
                    and so I was very glad to be able to get it repaired, because it was the best of
                    them all. </p>
                <p>That same drawing may be sold later for 50 guilders or so, and now — I hadn’t got
                    the money to have a tear in it repaired. Anyway.</p>
                <p>I do hope, brother, that you don’t think badly of Sien and me. That lass has put
                    up with my disagreeable side, and in many respects she understands me better
                    than others. She’s so willing to help in everything that I can’t tell you how
                    useful she is to me. If I get angry while she’s posing or about something else,
                    she knows how to take it, and has seen that it doesn’t go deep with me.
                        <unstress reason="love">Equally, if I fret or grumble about something that
                        isn’t going well, she often manages to calm me down, which I couldn’t do
                        mysel</unstress>f. And she’s thrifty and accepts our piece of black bread if
                    need be, without becoming despondent. And so do I, as long as we get by. I hope
                    that you’ve received <work origin="existing" stage="finished">the drawings I
                        sent around 10 May, I think, two dozen in a portfolio</work>. I’ve heard
                    nothing about it yet. I do wish there were a few more people I could do work for
                    on the same sort of conditions as for C.M. And above all that C.M. perseveres,
                    for these drawings are much better than the first, and gradually I’ll produce
                    even better ones. And at that price, he can’t go wrong. </p>
                <p>You know all about it: I’ll be in good spirits as long as you don’t desert me
                    because of Sien. I’m at work on the dot of 4, so with a little sympathy from
                    those who know me I’ll get on top of things. I’m hoping for your letter. Accept
                    a handshake in thought, but above all write soon and save me from the landlord.
                    Adieu.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>I’ve been back in my studio for a few hours and am writing to you immediately.
                        <good_health>I can’t tell you how wonderful it is to be better
                        again</good_health>, or <unstress reason="environment">how beautiful
                        everything looked on the road from the hospital to here</unstress>. And how
                    the light seemed brighter and the spaces bigger, and all the objects and figures
                    more important. There’s a ‘but’, though, and that ‘but’ is that I’ll
                        <bad_health>again have a catheter or a thick lead probe in my bladder, for
                        next Tuesday I have to go back to the doctor and tell him how I’ve been
                        getting on, and he has prepared me for the fact that I may then have to go
                        into hospital for another fortnight, possibly longer, possibly shorter,
                        depending on what’s needed</bad_health>. At any rate I would be absolutely
                    delighted if I didn’t have to go in again. As soon as I feel anything wrong I
                    have to go back, and even if I don’t notice anything I’ll go on Tuesday to be
                    examined again. The channel through which the urine passes must gradually be
                    widened, but this can’t be forced or rushed. The probes gradually become
                    thicker, and each time a new one goes in everything is stretched a little
                    further, and that’s painful, but above all extremely unpleasant, particularly
                    because the thing is left in place for a time. Blood comes out when it’s
                    removed, and then you feel relatively free for a few days, while the pain it
                    causes disappears. I’m now here in one of those intervals. Meanwhile I can now
                    pass water quite easily once more,<unstress reason="environment"> which makes me
                        feel on top of the world</unstress>, as if it were something very special.
                    But it must become entirely normal, and that will take time. Yet the sense of
                    getting better makes you forget all the catheters and probes and
                    instillations... until you see the doctor approaching with them again. And that
                    isn’t a very pleasant moment. Well, such are the petty troubles of life. But
                    what one might call a ‘great trouble’ is pregnancy and delivery — <stress
                        reason="friendship">the latest letter from Sien was very
                    melancholy</stress>. She hadn’t yet given birth but was expecting to at any
                    hour, and I feel very worried, because this waiting has been going on for days.
                    It was chiefly to be able to visit her that I asked the doctor to change the
                    walks in the garden into a short leave of absence, if it was at all possible. So
                    tomorrow morning I’m going to see her with her mother and child, Sunday being
                    the only day on which she’s allowed visitors. Her last letter to me wasn’t
                    written by herself but by the nurse, who herself asked that we should come
                    sometime. Yet we may still find that we aren’t allowed in. Poor lass, she’s full
                    of courage and not easily frightened, but according to that last letter there
                    was nothing in particular wrong except for inner frailty. I can’t tell you how I
                    longed for her in the hospital and how I long for her now, and at times I wasn’t
                    sorry that <bad_health>I had to cope with some suffering myself</bad_health>,
                    rather than standing there in excellent health, for then it would have been very
                    unevenly divided. If all goes well, though, Sien will be back this month, may
                    that prove to be the case. But the proverb says ‘A mother’s pains are
                    long-lasting’. This casts a dark shadow over the wonderful feeling of getting
                    better. I’m longing for tomorrow and dreading it at the same time. </p>
                <p>The first person I came across here in Schenkweg was my friend the carpenter, who
                    has helped me on several occasions with one job or another to do with making
                    instruments for perspective. And who’s also the foreman for the owner of the
                    studio I wrote to you about. His boss was just at the yard (the drawing of which
                    you have, with meadows in the distance), and they coaxed me into going along,
                    and showed me how they had left the room that would be the studio unpapered
                    pending my decision. I said I still couldn’t decide. Fine, said the man, but I
                    could choose what I wanted from a batch of wallpapers, then he would put it up
                    and I wouldn’t be under any obligation. And even though I said I didn’t want
                    that, since I had to go back to the hospital, they’ve already started work,
                    because they insist on showing me it before Tuesday. I must say the house is
                    very comfortable and looks really large and smart. The huge, fully panelled
                    attic alone would make a superb studio if need be, although the room facing
                    north was going to be the studio. And the price is unusually low for here; in
                    the city it would be about double. Three guilders a week for a large upstairs
                    flat is very little, even in comparison with neighbourhoods like Noordwal or the
                    Buitensingels. And the location is excellent for a painter. There’s one view
                    from the attic window that’s enchanting. Still, I didn’t want to take a decision
                        <bad_health>because both Sien and I are sick</bad_health>. But I’ll take the
                    matter up again as soon as we’re better. There is air and space, wonderful to
                    work in and keep healthy. Light from the north, and in the other room roughly
                    from the south. There’s a small kitchen I really hope to draw a lot, also with a
                    little window overlooking a sort of courtyard. I mustn’t forget to tell you
                    that, most unexpectedly, I had a visit in the hospital from Mr Tersteeg,
                        <unstress reason="friendship">which gave me great pleasure in one
                        sense</unstress>, although we didn’t talk about anything special, nor is
                    that necessary. But I thought it very kind. Then a few days later Iterson came
                    as well, about which I cared much less.</p>
                <p> And then Johan van Gogh, who I thought was in Helvoirt but turns out to be
                    living in Stationsweg these days. He told me that he, too, had had a bunch of
                    catheters and other musical instruments in his bladder once. Given that he
                    appears to be free of them now, I hope there’ll be an end to it in my case as
                    well. It would be too bad if a person had such adornments for a long time — it
                    would be hard to climb stairs or show yourself in public. If you send me
                    something at the beginning of this month, you should address the letter to the
                    hospital. It will be all right, because the porter has promised me to keep
                    letters if I’m away (this is allowed under hospital rules as long as one isn’t
                    finally discharged and puts in a request). On Tuesday I have to pay for the
                    hospital again, and the rent that I owe as well. <unstress reason="career">But
                        the finest thing of all about getting better is that my drawing is coming
                        back to life</unstress>, together with my feeling for things, which was
                    drugged, so to speak, for a time, and was a great void. I again enjoy everything
                    I see. And then, I haven’t smoked a pipe in about a month — that’s another old
                    friend back. I can’t tell you with what pleasure I sit here again in the studio
                    after spending so long in an environment of chamber-pots &amp;c., even though
                    the hospital is also beautiful, truly beautiful. Especially the garden with all
                    the strollers, men, women, children. I have a few scratches, but as a patient
                    you aren’t free to work as it ought to be done, and not up to it either. Well,
                    adieu, write soon, and believe me, with a handshake</p>

            <salutation>Dear brother,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Having received your letter and the 100 francs enclosed, I thank you most
                    sincerely and feel the need to write to you again straightaway. Because I think
                    it would be a good idea if I explained, honestly and to the best of my knowledge
                    and with all the earnestness in me, some matters which it’s important you should
                    be fully aware of and understand. So I hope that you’ll read this letter at your
                    ease and with patience, because for me so much depends on it.
                        <bad_health>Tomorrow morning I’m going back to the hospital and I’ll lay my
                        head down there calmly if I know that you’ve been informed about everything
                        as fully and clearly as the distance permits</bad_health>. I would much,
                    much rather that you’d been present, so that I could have shown you everything
                    here this afternoon and discussed it with you. But let’s hope that will happen
                    in August. Before going on to various other matters, <unstress
                        reason="environment">I must tell you that I was very taken by one passage in
                        your letter describing Paris by night. Because it evoked a memory of myself
                        when I too saw ‘Paris all grey’ and was struck by that so very curious
                        effect, with the little black figure and the distinctive white horse that
                        brings out the delicacy of those curious greys exactly like that.</unstress>
                    That touch of dark and that tonal white are the key to the harmony. But in the
                    hospital just recently, as it happens, an artist who described that Paris all
                    grey with the hand of a master made a great impression on me. In ‘Une page
                    d’amour’ by Emile Zola I found several townscapes painted or drawn in a
                    masterly, masterly fashion — entirely in the sentiment of the simple passage in
                    your letter. And that small book by him is why I’m very definitely going to read
                    everything by Zola, of whom I had only known a few fragments up to now: 1 for
                    which I attempted to make an illustration, ‘Ce que je veux’, and another piece
                    describing an old peasant that was exactly like a drawing by Millet. You have
                    something mightily artistic in you, brother — cultivate it — let it first put
                    down roots one way or another and then flower — don’t give it to just anyone —
                    but seriously, for yourself, think about it, and don’t consider it a misfortune
                    if it concentrates itself through that thinking and comes to occupy quite an
                    important place in your activity. But I may be venturing into forbidden
                    territory, so no more about that for today. Only, again, there is ‘drawing’ in
                    your short description — for me palpable and comprehensible, even though you
                    haven’t yet pursued your impression to the point where it would acquire a more
                    robust body and stand on its feet visibly or palpably for everyone. The true
                    pain and tension of creating begins at the point where you let go of the
                    description – but you have the intelligence of creating in damned good measure.
                    Now you can’t go any further because you don’t yet believe in yourself in this
                    respect, otherwise you would take the plunge, that’s to say venture further. But
                    enough. There’s a certain je ne sais quoi in your description, a scent — a
                    memory — of a watercolour by Bonington, for example, only it’s still faint as if
                    in a mist. Do you know that drawing in words is also an art, and sometimes
                    betrays a hidden force latent inside, just as the blue or grey cloud of smoke
                    betrays the hearth? </p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="family">I most certainly do appreciate what Pa and Ma
                        did</unstress> during<bad_health> my illness </bad_health>– you remember I
                    wrote to you about it right away — <unstress reason="friendship">as much as I
                        value the visit by H.G.T. </unstress>However, that’s not why I didn’t
                    immediately write to Pa and Ma about Sien or anything else, and only sent a
                    brief word to tell them of my recovery. And here’s why. Because something is
                    left of what happened last summer and this winter that marks the line between
                    past and present like an iron barrier. </p>
                <p>It isn’t in the least my intention to go in the same manner as last year to Pa
                    and Ma to ask their advice or opinion, because it became clear to me then that
                    there was a sharp difference in way of thinking and attitude to life.
                    Nonetheless, it is my ardent desire to keep the peace and to convince Pa and Ma
                    that it wouldn’t be right if they were to turn against me, in the belief that I
                    was someone who only dreamed and didn’t know how to act — that, I say, they are
                    mistaken in their view that my approach to situations is so impractical as to
                    make it necessary for them to ‘guide’ me. You see, Theo, believe me, I don’t say
                    this out of bitterness, contempt or disdain for Pa and Ma — or to glorify myself
                    — but only to help you grasp one fact, namely this. <stress reason="family">Pa
                        and Ma aren’t the sort of people to understand me — neither my faults nor my
                        better side — they can’t put themselves in my position.</stress> Reasoning
                    with them only leads to quarrels. What’s to be done??? Here’s my plan, which I
                    hope you will approve. I hope to arrange things so that, next month for example,
                    I can put aside 10 guilders, or preferably 15. Then — but not before — I want to
                    write to Pa and Ma that I have something to say to them, that I invite Pa to
                    repeat his journey at my expense and to stay with me for a few days. </p>
                <p>I want to show him Sien and her baby, which he won’t be expecting, as well as the
                    house bright and the studio with all manner of work in progress, and myself, by
                    then fully recovered, I hope. In my view all this will have a better and deeper
                    and more desirable effect than words or writing. I’ll tell him briefly how Sien
                    and I struggled through her anxious pregnancy last winter — how you helped and
                    still help us loyally, even though you only heard about Sien later. That for me
                    she is priceless, first through the love and attachment between us that
                    circumstances have strengthened, and second because from the start she has
                    devoted herself utterly, with great good will, intelligence and practical skill,
                    to helping me in my work. And that she and I dearly hope that Pa will approve of
                    my having taken her as my wife. I can’t put it any other way than ‘having
                    taken’, because the formality of marriage is not what makes her my wife, since
                    this is a bond that already exists — a feeling from both sides that we love,
                    understand and help each other. As for what Pa will say about marrying itself, I
                    believe he’ll say, ‘Marry her’. I would like Pa to have a fresh and clear
                    impression of a new future for me, to see me here in surroundings very different
                    from what he may imagine, for him to be completely reassured about my feelings
                    towards him, for him to have confidence in my future and put wardship or Geel a
                    thousand miles from his thoughts. You see, Theo, I know of no more direct or
                    honest way or means than what I’ve described to restore relations soon and in a
                    practical fashion. Write and let me know your feelings about this. </p>
                <p>Now, furthermore, I don’t think it superfluous to tell you again, although it’s
                    difficult to express, what I feel for Sien. <unstress reason="love">I have a
                        sense of being at home when I’m with her, a sense that she brings my ‘hearth
                        and home’ with her, a sense that we have grown together.</unstress> This is
                    an intensely deep feeling, serious and not without the dark shadow of her and my
                    fairly sombre pasts, a shadow I’ve written to you about before, as if, indeed,
                    something sombre continues to threaten us against which our life must be a
                    constant struggle.<unstress reason="environment"> At the same time, though, I
                        feel a great calm and clarity and cheerfulness at the thought of her and of
                        the straight path lying before me.</unstress> You know that last year
                        <unstress reason="love">I wrote to you a great deal about Kee Vos — so that,
                        it seems to me, you have a clear picture of what took place within me. Don’t
                        think that I exaggerated my feelings to you — it was a strong, passionate
                        love I felt for her, unlike that for Sien. When I discovered in Amsterdam
                        that she had a sort of dislike for me, which I didn’t</unstress> think was
                    the case, to such an extent that she regarded my behaviour as coercion and
                    wasn’t even prepared to see me, but ‘that she went out of the door of her own
                    house as long as I was inside it’, then — but not before — my love for her
                    received a mortal blow. Which I first became aware of when, recovering from my
                    intoxication as it were, I was in The Hague this winter. At that time there was
                    a sense of inexpressible melancholy in me which I find impossible to describe. I
                    know that I then thought very, very often of a manly remark by père Millet: ‘It
                    has always seemed to me that suicide is the act of a dishonest man’. </p>
                <p>
                    <bad_health>The emptiness, the inexpressible wretchedness inside, made me
                        think</bad_health> — yes, I can understand why there are people who jump
                    into the water — it’s just that I was far from approving of what those people
                    did, and I found solidity in the words I’ve quoted, and thought it much the
                    better approach to get hold of oneself and seek a medicine in work. The way, as
                    you know, I tackled it then. It’s difficult, terribly difficult, indeed
                    impossible, to think of something like my passion of last year as an illusion.
                    That’s what Pa and Ma do, but I say, ‘Even if it will never be, it could have
                    been’. It wasn’t an illusion, but the attitudes differed and the turn taken by
                    circumstances was such that the ways diverged further and further instead of
                    coming together. This is how I see it — these are my clear and honest thoughts —
                    it could have been but now it never can be. Was Kee Vos right to have a dislike
                    for me, was I wrong to persist? I declare I do not know. And it isn’t without
                    pain and sorrow that I think back on it and write about it. I would like so much
                    to understand better why Kee Vos was like that then and how it was that my
                    parents and hers were so adamantly ominous and opposed, not so much through
                    their words — although very certainly through them too, above all indirectly in
                    the meaning more than the form — as through their complete lack of genuine,
                    warm, living sympathy. I can’t soften these words, but I think of it as a mood
                    of theirs that I would rather forget. Now, in the circumstances, it’s like a
                    large, deep wound in me that has healed but is still palpable. </p>
                <p> At that time — in that winter — <stress reason="love">could I feel ‘love’ again
                        straight afterwards? Certainly not.</stress> But was it wrong that the human
                    feeling in me wasn’t extinguished or numbed, and that my sorrow indeed aroused a
                    need for compassion with others??? I think not. So at first Sien was a fellow
                    human being to me, as alone and unhappy as I was. Yet, not being in despair, I
                    was in the right state of mind to be able to give her some practical support,
                    which at the same time was a stimulus to me to carry on. But gradually, slowly,
                    something else developed between her and me. <unstress reason="love">A certain
                        need for each other. So that she and I stayed close together, entering each
                        other’s lives more and more, and then it was love.</unstress> Theo, I must
                    perhaps touch on a point that may be painful for you that may make you
                    understand what I mean. In the past you had what Pa and Ma also call an
                    ‘illusion’ for a woman of the people, and the fact that nothing came of it
                    wasn’t because you couldn’t take that path in life but because things took a
                    different course, and you have since adapted to life in another class where you
                    are now firmly established, so that for you it wouldn’t again be an illusion if
                    you wanted to marry a girl from your class. In your case that wouldn’t arouse
                    any comment, and although nothing came of that first love, something might come
                    of a new love, and you would succeed. In my opinion, your way is definitely not
                    to take a woman of the people: with you the so-called illusion was the woman of
                    the people; the reality for you has now become the woman from the same kind of
                    class as Kee Vos. For me, though, it’s the other way round: the illusion
                    (ALTHOUGH I DON’T BELIEVE THAT WORD OR DEFINITION WAS APPROPRIATE OR ACCURATE,
                    EITHER IN YOUR CASE OR MINE) was Kee Vos; the reality has become the woman of
                    the people. </p>
                <p>There’s a difference between your case and mine in several respects. Your failure
                    was when you were twenty, mine last year. But although both you and I may have
                    had an illusion, failure or whatever — I really don’t know what to call it —
                    that doesn’t rule out something more real, either for you or for me. For I’m
                    quite sure that neither of us is cut out to be celibate. What I want to make
                    clear is this: what there is between Sien and me is real; it’s not a dream, it
                    is reality. I count it a great blessing that my thoughts and capacity for work
                    have found a focus, a particular direction. While it may be that I felt more
                    passion for Kee Vos, and that in some respects she was more charming than Sien,
                    it is certainly not so that the love for Sien is therefore less sincere, for the
                    circumstances are too grave, and it all comes down to taking action and being
                    practical, and that has always been so since I first met her. You can see what
                    the result is... now if you come you won’t find me dejected or melancholy, but
                    you’ll enter a setting with which I believe you’ll be satisfied, or at least
                    like. A young studio, a still young, fully functioning household. Not a mystical
                    or mysterious studio, but one that has rooted itself in real life. A studio with
                    a cradle and a close-stool. Where there’s no stagnation and everything prompts
                    and urges and generates activity. </p>
                <p>Now if someone or other comes to tell me that I’m a poor financier, I’ll show him
                    my place here. I’ve done my best, brother, to ensure that you can see (and not
                    just you, but everyone with eyes in his head) that I strive and sometimes manage
                    to tackle things practically. HOW TO DO IT. This winter we had the woman’s
                    pregnancy and my expenses in getting settled. Now the woman has given birth,
                    I’ve been ill for four weeks — and still not better — despite all that the place
                    is clean and cheerful and bright and tidy, and I have a large part of my
                    furniture, bedding and painting materials. It has cost what it cost, to be sure
                    I won’t underestimate it, but your money hasn’t gone down the drain. A young
                    studio has come from it which can’t yet do without your help, but from which
                    more and more drawings will gradually emerge and which requires only essential
                    furniture and tools, which retain their value. You see, old chap, if you come
                    here now to a house full of life and activity, knowing that you are its founder
                    — won’t that give you a proper sense of satisfaction, more so than if I were a
                    celibate spending my life in bars? Would you have it otherwise??? You know that
                    I wasn’t always happy, and sometimes truly wretched, and now through your help
                    my youth is emerging, and my true development. </p>
                <p>Now I just hope that you won’t lose sight of this great change, even when people
                    think you’re mad to have helped or to help me. And that you’ll continue to see
                    in the present drawings the seed of later ones. A little longer in the hospital
                    and then I’ll go back to work, and the woman and child will pose. It’s as clear
                    as daylight to me that one must feel what one makes, that one must live in the
                    reality of family life if one wants to portray family life intimately — a mother
                    and child, a washerwoman, a seamstress, whatever. </p>
                <p>As a result of stubborn labour, the hand is gradually becoming obedient to that
                    feeling. But if I were to snuff out this feeling, and the strength to have my
                    own household,<stress reason="environment"> that would be suicide</stress>.
                    That’s why I say — onward — despite dark shadows, cares and difficulties, also,
                    alas, through people interfering and gossiping. Theo — make no mistake —
                    although I, as you rightly say, stay out of it, it often pierces me to the soul.
                    But do you know why I no longer argue with them and why I stay out of it? —
                    because I must work and may not let myself be diverted from my path by the
                    gossip and difficulties. But I don’t stay out of it because I’m afraid of them
                    or am at a loss for words. Also, I’ve often noticed that they say nothing in my
                    presence, and even claim never to have said anything. As for you, knowing that I
                    don’t get involved in order not to make myself nervous and because of my work,
                    you’ll be able to understand my attitude and not think it cowardly of me, won’t
                    you? Don’t imagine that I think myself perfect — or that I believe it isn’t my
                    fault that many people find me a disagreeable character. <bad_health>I’m often
                        terribly and cantankerously melancholic, irritable — yearning for sympathy
                        as if with a kind of hunger and thirst — I become indifferent, sharp, and
                        sometimes even pour oil on the flames if I don’t get sympathy.</bad_health>
                    <stress reason="friendship">I don’t enjoy company, and dealing with people,
                        talking to them, is often painful and difficult for me.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>But do you know where a great deal if not all of this comes from? Simply from
                    nervousness — <stress reason="environment">I who am terribly sensitive, both
                        physically and morally, only really acquired it in the years when I was
                        deeply miserable</stress>. Ask a doctor and he’ll immediately understand
                    entirely how it couldn’t be otherwise than that nights spent on the cold street
                    or out of doors, the anxiety about coming by bread, <stress reason="environment"
                        >constant tension because I didn’t really have a job, sorrow with friends
                        and family were at least 3/4 of the cause of some of my peculiarities of
                        temperament</stress> — and whether the fact that I sometimes have
                    disagreeable moods or periods of depression couldn’t be attributable to this?
                    But neither you nor anyone else who takes the trouble to think about it will, I
                    hope, condemn me or find me unbearable because of that. I fight against it, but
                    that doesn’t alter my temperament. <stress reason="environment"> And even if I
                        consequently have a bad side, well damn it, I have my good side as well, and
                        can’t they take that into consideration too?</stress> Write to me to say
                    whether you approve of my little plan for telling Pa and Ma and establishing
                    better relations. I don’t feel in the least like just writing about it or going
                    to discuss it, and would probably then make my usual mistake of putting it in
                    such a way that they take offence at some expression or other. There you are. I
                    think when the woman is back with her child, I <good_health> fully recovered and
                        back from the hospital</good_health>, the studio working, then I would like
                    to say to Pa: come and resume your visit and stay with me for a few days to talk
                    things over. And then send the travel expenses as a courtesy. I can’t think of a
                    better plan. Adieu, thank you for everything, and a handshake, and believe me

            <salutation>My dear Theo, </salutation>
            <body>
                <p>On Friday <good_health>I received a message from the hospital in Leiden to say
                        that Sien could go home on Saturday</good_health>. So I went there today and
                    we came back together and she’s now here at Schenkweg — so far everything is
                    fine, both with her and the baby. Fortunately, she has good milk, the baby is
                    quiet. I would have given a lot to have you see her today. Her appearance has
                    changed enormously, I assure you, since this winter. It’s a complete
                    transformation. I may have had something to do with that this winter, through
                    your help of course, but much, much more of the credit must go to the professor
                    who treated her. But in turn the professor had less to do with the effect on her
                    of the strong attachment between her and me. A woman changes when she loves and
                    is loved; if there’s no one who cares for them the drive and charm goes. It
                    brings out what is in her, and her development most decidedly depends on this.
                    Nature must run its course, follow its normal way. What a woman wants is to be
                    with one man and to stay with him for good. That’s not always possible, but if
                    it is otherwise it goes against nature. So she now has a different look compared
                    to last winter, her eyes are different, her gaze is now steady and calm, and
                    there’s an expression of happiness in her, of peace and rest, which is all the
                    more striking because of course she’s still in pain. I’ve written to you before
                    that the shape of her head, the line of her profile, is precisely that of that
                    figure by Landelle, the Angel of the passion. So that’s far from ordinary, it’s
                    decidedly noble, but it isn’t always immediately apparent. But today it was
                    precisely, precisely that. Before she left, the professor (who has taken a
                    liking to her — also knows her from the past — and gave her special attention
                    this time — and examined her completely and thoroughly at her request, prompted
                    by what I had agreed with her before she went there) took the trouble to have a
                    long talk with her and give her detailed information about what she must do to
                    stay on top of things. 1 Be with one man, since her whole constitution and
                    temperament make her suitable for domestic life and decidedly unsuited to the
                    kind of life she was brought to by her past misery. 2 That she must be out of
                    doors often, and do plenty of walking as soon as she’s strong enough — breathe
                    in lots of air and freshness. 3 As to food, he told her what she must eat and
                    what isn’t good for her. 4 She must wash often with cold water and brandy, and
                    regularly take a hot bath every week. 5 She must avoid emotions that make her
                    nervous: anxiety, tension, agitation.</p>
                <p> 6 No scrubbing floors or similar really hard work, especially not with the head
                    lowered as when mopping a corridor, also especially no lifting of heavy objects.
                    Thus broadly what he’d already said before, only now he explained it to her in
                    more detail. It’s clear to me from everything that he takes a special interest
                    in her. Naturally, he also talked to her about me at some length; knows about my
                    illness, and says I was quite right to go to the hospital, even told her exactly
                    how he thinks I got it; not once but repeatedly he came back to whether she was
                    really with me permanently – whether I wouldn’t leave her in the lurch – and
                    when she continued to reassure him, even when he said that she was just fooling
                    him, he ended by saying, well, if you’ve really got your man for good, you’ve
                    gained a great deal. He kept hammering on the point that she must have a
                    domestic, regular and quiet life. When she left, not only the nurse on the ward
                    where she was but also the head nurse herself came to say goodbye. I was there,
                    and since I had had three letters from this person telling me how things were
                    going when Sien wasn’t allowed to write, I thanked her for that. And she stayed
                    talking to us for quite a long time. Fortunately, it was very warm, fine weather
                    and the journey went well. Sien’s mother and Sien’s little girl had gone to
                    Schenkweg and were waiting for us. It really was a lovely homecoming, and Sien
                    was in high spirits over everything, especially over the cradle, over her wicker
                    chair, over everything. But above all she was delighted to see her little girl
                    again, who had received a new pair of boots from me for the occasion and looked
                    very nice. In May there was a combination of difficulties, her confinement,
                        <bad_health>my illness</bad_health>, and this was complicated by the
                    question of what to do, where she was to go. In many respects, light and a
                    resolution have come. She’s now still in considerable pain at times, mainly as a
                    consequence of the operation with forceps, and there are other necessary effects
                    of her confinement. There’s the great weakness, but one can see from her
                    appearance that she’s undergoing a renewal and a blossoming, a recovery of her
                    body and a recovery of her soul at the same time. And here there is now an
                    atmosphere of ‘home’, or ‘Home’ or ‘hearth and home’. I can understand that
                    Michelet says ‘Woman is a religion’. She’ll probably continue to be in pain for
                    at least 6 weeks after the birth, and mustn’t overdo things at all. I believe
                    that you can see, for example, from the interest taken in her by the professor
                    and the head nurse that she’s someone for whom serious people feel a sympathy,
                    because it really is something special for them to have cosseted her so much.
                    When I was in the maternity ward and saw various other patients, it struck me
                    that she was a very different type of person from the others, though she’s
                    simple enough. Only there’s more spirit and sensitivity in her; one can see that
                    suffering and going through hard times have refined her. </p>
                <p>I hope you won’t feel any scruples about meeting her. I’ve been greatly
                    entertained by what Sien has told me of her conversations with the professor. It
                    really was amusing, and the man seems to go about his work with a good deal of
                    bonhomie. For example, he said: tell me, do you enjoy a glass of bitters and can
                    you smoke cigars? Yes, she replied. I ask, he said, in order to tell you that
                    you don’t need to give that up. On the other hand, she got a terrible dressing
                    down about using vinegar, mustard and pepper. On days when she feels more thirst
                    than hunger, as often happens, she is to take a glass of bitters as a medicine
                    to stimulate the appetite. </p>
                <p>He has given her the list of restoratives, having consulted her as to her means.
                    I’ll also keep to what he recommends in this respect. Meat is good for her, but
                    once or twice a week is actually enough; it certainly isn’t required every day.
                    Her principal remedy, her most important restorative, was having a home; he kept
                    coming back to that. I had been rather concerned that Sien might need things
                    that would prove expensive, but the kind of life that he has prescribed is also
                    the thriftiest one could imagine. So I really do believe we’ll be able to manage
                    on 150 francs a month. Sien was also told that for a period of 2 years she can
                    consult the professor in Leiden free of charge if her child is ill, and also get
                    free medicines there for him. My concern, child, is not just to get you through
                    your confinement, said the professor, but also in a year or so I hope to see you
                    a strong, vigorous woman. You have a whole life ahead of you if you don’t ignore
                    what I say. In short, he talked to her and gave her information as if he were
                    her own father, in large things and in small. And so she came home much more
                    cheerful and clear-headed than when she left. </p>
                <p>
                    <good_health>I am well</good_health>, but I’ve noticed that <bad_health>I’ve
                        become quite weak</bad_health>; this will pass, though. But it isn’t
                    surprising if you reckon that for over two months I have had and still have, to
                    some extent, for instance, <bad_health>poor digestion, little appetite, chronic
                        fever, &amp;c.</bad_health> Passing water was much better until a few
                    particularly raw, wet days had a rather adverse effect on me. For several days
                    the stream on passing water was again strong and, so to speak, entirely normal.
                    While that hasn’t completely continued since, it’s nevertheless a sign of
                    progress, it seems to me, and if the weather stays dry and warm like today it
                    will progress more rapidly. I’ve been drawing again, and <bad_health>although it
                        gave me a headache and soon tired me out</bad_health>, it will gradually
                    improve. Especially since little by little I’ll be able to resume posing the
                    woman and child at home. My weakness is a disappointment, but the sort of things
                    I had always have that effect. The <work mention="vague">two drawings I’ve done
                        in the past few days are both watercolours</work>. Because I wanted to make
                    an experiment. </p>
                <p>It seems to me, though, that I must still keep working mainly at pure drawing,
                    which is the foundation of all the rest. But as you saw in the latest, I’m
                    gradually beginning to use wash. As soon as I’m fully recovered I would like to
                    make a more serious attempt at a particular watercolour on Harding, because that
                    paper (more than Whatman) allows you to apply a solid basis or ground in black
                    and white before starting to wash, without it taking away the look of
                    watercolour. But at present I can’t work for long enough at a time on a piece,
                    which is very frustrating because I long so much to work and to go outdoors.
                    Meanwhile I’m glad that at least I can now do a little again. I began this
                    letter yesterday evening and I can now tell you that we, namely the woman and
                    the two children and I, spent the night in the big attic. </p>
                <p>That bedroom looks a lot like a ship’s hold because it’s all panelled, and I
                    believe that to be very healthy. The cradle has to go downstairs during the day.
                    It all went fine, and as long as there’s no unpleasantness from outside, which I
                    have hopes there won’t be, we’ll get along quite well inside. As for me, I don’t
                    find the company of the woman and the children odd, but feel precisely as if I’m
                    more in my element and as if things had been like this for much longer. I’m
                    quite used to rolling up my sleeves to do things that the woman is too weak for,
                    such as making the bed or a thousand other chores. I’ve faced all manner of
                    tasks like that, either for myself or often enough for the sick &amp;c. And that
                    those things aren’t an impediment to the work of painting and drawing is amply
                    proved by the old Dutch paintings and drawings. It can do no harm to have the
                    studio and family blending together, especially as regards figure drawing. I
                    remember studio interiors by Ostade, small pen drawings, probably bits of his
                    own house, which make it clear enough that Ostade’s studio probably bore little
                    resemblance to those studios where there are oriental arms and vases and Persian
                    carpets &amp;c. To continue on the subject of art, I sometimes feel a great
                    desire to get back to painting. The studio is now more spacious, the light
                    better, I have a good cupboard for keeping paint &amp;c. without creating too
                    much mess and dirt. Also, I’ve already straightaway started working with
                    watercolour again. It depends on my recovery, but as soon as I no longer run the
                    risk of collapsing and can go outdoors for long periods and sit quietly in the
                    open, I plan to take all that up again and put all my energy into it. I believe
                    that now that Sien and I are living together and are no longer two separate
                    households, as it were, I’ll be able to save more for painting materials from
                    150 francs a month than before. Neither Sien nor I mind making do, and as long
                    as I don’t earn more myself by selling drawings we won’t buy much more in the
                    way of furniture or household items, for example. For she and I would both much
                    rather wait for those sorts of things than take more money now, even if we could
                    get it. </p>
                <p>For her part, Sien will start posing again seriously as soon as she has
                    recovered, and I assure you her figure is interesting enough. In fact, you can
                    see for yourself in Sorrow, for example, and a few of the others you have, that
                    she knows how to approach posing and is suited to it. I have several nude
                    studies that you haven’t seen yet. I also definitely want to continue with them
                    as soon as she’s ready, because one learns a great deal from that.</p>
                <p>Even if I have to give up working out of doors for a considerable time if my
                    health deteriorates (which I hope won’t happen), at any rate now I’ll have
                    enough material indoors to occupy myself. I’ve had a friendly letter from Pa and
                    Ma. Just imagine, again with two money orders enclosed, even. They mustn’t do
                    that any more, though. I know they need it themselves, and I say again that we
                    can manage with the money from you now that things are turning out so well as
                    regards the improvement in Sien’s condition, and mine too. So I really would
                    rather not have the money from Pa and Ma. As I wrote to you, as soon as I can
                    save the money and the woman is better I even wanted to send some to Pa to pay
                    for a journey here so that we can discuss this and that. What pleases me more
                    than the money orders is that they’re in what seems to me the best mood in the
                    circumstances, so that when I speak to them about Sien they won’t, I hope,
                    immediately be against it but respond with good will. I recently saw the
                    exhibition of French art (on the Boschkant) from the collections of Mesdag, Post
                    &amp;c.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="environment">There are many beautiful things there by Dupré,
                        Corot, Daubigny, Diaz, Courbet, Breton, Jacque &amp;c. I especially liked
                        the large sketch by T. Rousseau from the Mesdag collection, a drove of
                        cattle in the Alps. And a landscape by Courbet: yellow hilly, sandy ground,
                        with fresh young grass growing here and there, with black brushwood fences
                        against which a few white birch trunks stand out, grey buildings in the
                        distance with red and blue slate roofs.</unstress> And a narrow, small,
                    light delicate grey band of sky above. The horizon very high, however, so that
                    the ground is the main thing, and the delicate little band of sky really serves
                    more as contrast to bring out the rough texture of the masses of dark earth. I
                    think this is the most beautiful work by Courbet that I’ve seen so far. </p>
                <p>The Duprés are superb, and there’s a Daubigny, big thatched roofs against the
                    slope of a hill, that I couldn’t get enough of. The same goes for a small Corot,
                    a stretch of water and the edge of a wood on a summer morning about 4 o’clock. A
                    single small pink cloud indicates that the sun will come up in a while. A
                    stillness and calm and peace that enchants one. I’m glad to have seen all
                    this.</p>
                <p>Well, I’m going to close. I hope that you’ll write soon and above all that you
                    really will come to Holland towards August. I’m writing to you ‘in between jobs’
                    because, as you can imagine, there’s a lot to be done now. I let Sien potter
                    about but I always have to keep an eye on what she’s doing so that I can chance
                    to be at hand if she needs help. For she really is very weak still (so much so
                    that the professor, she told me, said ‘damned’ weak), and yet it’s good that in
                    doing this and that she has a distraction. Anything that cheers her up and makes
                    her light-hearted is medicine for her. The baby, too, is far from out of danger
                    — you know how the child was delivered — that always has an effect on the child,
                    and little can be said as to how it will turn out for another 6 weeks. Much
                    depends on the milk, of course. I hope you’re not too bored reading all this, I
                    wanted to write a brief word and it has turned into a long letter. I’m not yet
                    running short, but if you could send something around the twentieth that would
                    be helpful for the last days of the month.Adieu, with a hearty handshake in
                    thought. </p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo, </salutation>
            <body>
                <p>It matters greatly to me that you shouldn’t get the idea that I’m in a dejected
                    or abnormal mood. That’s why I wrote to you already about work in my last
                    letter, and since I have a few more things to ask in that connection I haven’t
                    waited long before writing again. By the time you come I’ll do my best to have
                    several watercolours done in different ways ready for you to see, then we can
                    discuss which seems best to you.</p>
                <p>So I’ll work regularly on <work origin="new" stage="middle"> this every day, and
                        continue to do so until you come. I now have 3 of Scheveningen — again the
                        Fish-drying barn you know — drawn in as much detail — only now there’s
                        colour as well</work>. As you well know, Theo, it isn’t harder to work in
                    colour than in black and white, the opposite perhaps, but as far as I can see
                    3/4 comes down to the original sketch, and almost the whole watercolour depends
                    on its quality. It isn’t enough to give an approximation, and my aim has been
                    and still is to make it more intense. I believe that’s already evident in the
                    black-and-white fish-drying barns, because there you can follow everything and
                    see how it all fits together, and look, I think this is why I now work much more
                    fluently in watercolour, because for such a long time I did my best to draw more
                    correctly. </p>
                <p>Tersteeg said that what I was doing was a waste of time; soon you’ll see that
                    I’ve saved a great deal of time. I already feel that, and you’ll see it for
                    yourself when you come. </p>
                <p> This evening I went from one shop to another searching for thick Ingres, but in
                    vain. They have the thin, but the dense or double is nowhere to be found. At the
                    time I bought all that Stam had left, and it was wonderfully mature. Before you
                    come, oh do your best to find some once more. And if you can’t get any, try
                    asking for ‘papier de la forme’. That is with a yellowish tint — stiff — and you
                    can use wash on it. I believe it’s also much cheaper than Harding or
                        Whatman,<unstress reason="money"> so that in the end there’s quite a
                        saving</unstress>. When you come I know of a few lovely paths through the
                    meadows where it’s so quiet and peaceful that you’ll be delighted. I’ve
                    discovered old and new labourer’s cottages there, and other houses that are
                    distinctive, with small gardens lining the banks of the ditch — really charming.
                    I’m going to draw there early tomorrow morning. It’s a path through the meadows
                    from Schenkweg to Enthoven’s factory or Het Zieke. I saw a dead pollard willow
                    there, just the thing for Barye, for example. It hung over a pond with reeds,
                    all alone and melancholy, and its bark was scaled and mossy, as it were, and
                    spotted and marbled in various tones — something like the skin of a snake,
                    greenish, yellowish, mostly dull black. With white flaking spots and stumpy
                    branches. I’m going to attack it tomorrow morning. I’ve also done a bleaching
                    ground at Scheveningen, on the spot in one go, entirely in wash almost without
                    preparation, on a very coarse piece of torchon. <work stage="sketch"
                        origin="new">Here are a couple of small sketches of it.</work> I’ll make
                    sure that several things are ready by the time you come. I think you’ll like the
                    Fish-drying barn now that it’s with colours. </p>
                <p>Make no mistake, old chap, I’m fully back into my normal routine, and rest
                    assured that everything else depends on work, and I see everything as directly
                    related to that. The new studio makes a huge difference compared to the previous
                    one in that it’s more pleasant to work in; for posing, especially, it’s a great
                    improvement because one can stand further back. I’m sure it will be well worth
                    the extra rent. I have one request for you, though. I would entirely understand
                    and would find it quite natural if, instead of sending the money on 1 August,
                    you were to give it to me yourself when you arrive on, say, 7 August. As soon as
                    I received your last letter, however, I made some purchases of paper and paint
                    and brushes, and by 1 August I’ll certainly need some more things. So I want to
                    ask you to be so kind as to send something all the same just before 1 August, if
                    possible, even though you’ll be coming soon afterwards, because I’ve worked it
                    out exactly, exactly, and after the first few days of <stress reason="money">
                        August I’ll certainly be absolutely broke</stress>. I hope this won’t
                    inconvenience you: of course, more is not the intention; it’s the time that
                    matters, namely 1 August, if possible, and otherwise only a few days later. I
                    also have a second of the Rijswijk meadows in which the same subject takes on an
                    entirely different aspect through being seen from a different height and
                    viewpoint. As you see, I’ve become very caught up in landscapes. The reason is
                    that Sien can’t pose yet, but otherwise the figure must remain the chief
                    concern. </p>
                <p>When you come I’ll take care to be close to home as long as you’re in the city
                    and that you know where I am, and otherwise I’ll carry on with my normal routine
                    while you do your business and pay visits. I can find you wherever you suggest a
                    meeting, but for various reasons I believe it’s better for both of us if I don’t
                    go with you to the Plaats, say, or to Mauve, for example. I’m so used to my
                    working clothes, in which I can sit or lie in the sand or grass as I please (for
                    in the dunes, for example, I hardly ever use a chair, except perhaps an old fish
                    basket), that my outfit is rather too Robinson Crusoe-like for me to accompany
                    you much on your rounds. I say this in advance so that you’ll know I won’t be an
                    embarrassment to you, but otherwise you understand that I long for every half
                    hour you can spare. I think we’ll be more at ease if we’re completely taken up
                    by painting and drawing, and talk mainly about that. Unless you’re not bored or
                    embarrassed by other matters, if not, then of course I have no secrets from you,
                    and you have my complete confidence in everything. I also long to show you the
                    woodcuts. I have another splendid one, a drawing by Fildes, ‘Dickens’s empty
                    chair’ from The Graphic of 70. I could have bought 3 etchings by Meryon for 2
                    guilders for all three, but I let them go. They were good though, but I have so
                    few etchings and want to concentrate on woodcuts if I buy anything else. But I
                    wanted to tell you about them — Blok has them, and I don’t know if all Meryons
                    are rare and valuable. They’re from an old volume of L’Artiste. I’m still under
                    the spell of Zola’s books. How painted those Halles are. <good_health>My health
                        is good</good_health>, though I still feel the odd thing and will probably
                    continue to do so, at least for some time yet. Sien and the child are also well;
                    they’re getting stronger and <unstress reason="love">I love them
                        dearly</unstress>. I must have another go at the cradle (when it’s a rainy
                    day and I can’t go outside), entirely in watercolour. But for the rest, when you
                    come I want to show you — landscape watercolours — nearer winter I hope to have
                    figure watercolours, that is, after I’ve been here a year. First I’ll have to
                    draw more nudes and a lot more in black and white, it seems to me. We’ll discuss
                    all that, and I don’t doubt that your visit will be a great help in keeping
                    things in order and making work go smoothly. Adieu, with a handshake. </p>

            <ps>

                <p>By quietly carrying on with my work I have every hope I’ll gradually acquire a
                    new circle of friends to make up for the <stress reason="friendship">loss of the
                        friendliness of Mauve, HGT and others</stress>. But I’ll take no steps to
                    bring that about, none at all, for it must come through the work. What has
                    happened to me with H.G.T. is nothing out of the ordinary; everyone experiences
                    things like that in life. It’s impossible to say exactly what the cause is. But
                    in the case of H.G.T. it’s an old grievance. I know now with near certainty that
                    he said things about me long ago which did much to cast me in a bad light.
                    However, I needn’t be concerned about that — what could hurt me in the past
                    can’t do so now. When you come to the studio you’ll see for yourself how utterly
                    absurd it is for him to say: oh, your drawing will never amount to anything. But
                    it’s difficult to counter a pronouncement like that, because as soon as one does
                    so it’s seen as conceit, and people cite the very greatest names and say: he
                    thinks he’s so-and-so or so-and-so. </p>
                <p>But, again, anyone who works with love and with intelligence has a kind of armour
                    against people’s opinion in the sincerity of his love for nature and art. Nature
                    is severe and hard, so to speak, but never deceives and always helps you to go
                    forward. So I don’t count it a misfortune if I find myself out of favour with
                    HGT or anyone else, however much I regret it. That can’t be the direct cause of
                    unhappiness — if I felt no love for nature and my work, then I would be unhappy.
                    But the less I get on with people the more I learn to trust nature and to
                    concentrate on it. All these things make me fresher and fresher inside — you’ll
                    also see that I’m not afraid of a fresh green or a soft blue and the thousand
                    different greys, for there’s hardly any colour that isn’t a grey: red-grey,
                    yellow-grey, green-grey, blue-grey. This is what all colour mixing comes down
                    to. When I went back to the Fish-drying barn, a luxuriant and indescribably
                    fresh green from a wild vegetable or oilseed had shot up in the baskets filled
                    with sand in the foreground that serve to stop the sand of the dunes blowing
                    about. Two months ago it was all barren except for a bit of grass in the small
                    garden, and now that rough, wild, luxuriantly sprouting green produced a most
                    pleasant effect as a contrast to the bareness of the rest. I hope you’ll like
                    that drawing. The vista — the view over the roofs of the village with the small
                    church tower and the dunes — was so attractive. I can’t tell you with how much
                    pleasure I drew it. So come soon — I believe you’ll be completely content with
                    the change of studio when you see how infinitely better it is for my work — more
                    space, better light, greater distance. </p>





                <p>Yesterday evening I got a parcel from home. Among other things, it contained a
                    sort of demi-saison which is very useful. It was very kind of them. And there
                    were tobacco and cigars, a cake and underwear. In short, a whole package. Don’t
                    you think that’s kind? It’s more that I’m pleased by it showing their warm
                    feelings than by anything else. I’ve also had another letter from
                        Rappard.<unstress reason="friendship"> I take enormous pleasure in the fact
                        that that chap is so fascinated by his English woodcuts.</unstress> I got
                    him going in the beginning, but now he needs no further encouragement; <unstress
                        reason="environment">now he’s almost as enthusiastic as I am. </unstress>
                </p>
                <p>When you come I’ll show you a few prints which, once seen, won’t lightly fade
                    from memory. Among them there are things very different from the school of
                    Boughton, say, although he’s certainly one of the leaders. I mean things
                    remarkable at once for their reality and their style, drawn like Albrecht Dürer
                    but with lots of local colour and chiaroscuro. You don’t often see those prints
                    any more these days; for you have to look for them in magazines of 10 or 15
                    years ago. For example, during the war of 70-71. </p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Still very much under the impression of your visit, <unstress
                        reason="environment">and more than a little pleased that I can go on
                        painting with new vigour</unstress>, I’m writing you a few words. I had
                    wanted to take you to the train the next morning — but I thought you had already
                    given me so much time that it would have been impolite if I had asked you for
                    the following morning as well. <unstress reason="friendship">I’m very grateful
                        to you for visiting me here</unstress> — it’s wonderful to have the prospect
                    of a year of steady work without disasters, and thanks to what you gave me I now
                    also have a new horizon in painting. I regard myself as privileged above a
                    thousand others in that you remove so many barriers in my way.</p>
                <p>It goes without saying that many often can’t carry on because of the expense;
                    well, I can hardly put into words how <unstress reason="career">thankful I am to
                        be able to keep on working steadily</unstress>. I have to try twice as hard
                    to make up for lost time because I began later than others, and with the best
                    will in the world I would have to give up if I didn’t have you. Let me tell you
                    about everything I’ve bought. </p>
                <p>First, a large moist colour box for 12 pieces or tubes of watercolour with a
                    folding lid that serves as a palette when open — there’s also room for 6
                    brushes. </p>
                <p>This is a valuable piece of equipment for working out of doors, in fact
                    absolutely essential, but it’s expensive and in my mind I had postponed it until
                    later, and until now worked with loose pieces on saucers, but they’re awkward to
                    carry, especially if you have other items as well. So it’s a fine thing to have,
                    and once you have one it will last you for a long time. At the same time I
                    bought a supply of watercolour and replaced my brushes and added some new ones.
                    Moreover, I now have all the essentials for proper painting. And a supply of
                    paint — big tubes (which work out much cheaper than small ones), but you will
                    understand that I’ve limited myself to simple colours in both watercolour and
                    oil: ochre (red, yellow, brown), cobalt and Prussian blue, Naples yellow, terra
                    sienna, black and white, supplemented with some carmine, sepia, vermilion,
                    ultramarine, gamboge in smaller tubes. But I refrained from buying colours one
                    ought to mix oneself.</p>



                <p>I believe this is a practical palette, with sound colours. Ultramarine, carmine
                    or something else are added if absolutely necessary. </p>
                <p>I’ll start with small things — but before the summer ends I hope to practise
                    bigger sketches in charcoal with an eye to painting in a rather larger format
                    later. This is why I’m having a new and, I hope, better perspective frame made,
                    which will stand firmly on two legs in uneven ground like the dunes. </p>

                <p>Like this, for example. What we saw together at Scheveningen, sand — sea — sky —
                    is something I certainly hope to express one day. Of course I didn’t spend
                    everything you gave me all at once — although I must say the prices of things
                    greatly took me aback, especially bearing in mind that more items are needed
                    than appears at first sight. It would be a help if you could send the usual
                    around the twentieth, not because everything will be gone by then, but because I
                    think it advisable to keep a little in my pocket in case, while working, I find
                    that I really need something or other. That will help me to work calmly and in
                    an orderly fashion.</p>
                <p>The moist colour box fits into the painting box — so that if need be I can carry
                    everything required both for watercolour and for painting in one object. I place
                    great value on having good materials, and would like my studio to look
                    substantial — but without antiquities or tapestries and drapery — but through
                    the studies on the walls and good tools. That will have to come with work and
                    time. On the subject of the village constable style — I feel less like a village
                    constable than like a Delft bargee, for example, and I don’t at all object to my
                    place being like a cosy tow barge. Yesterday afternoon I was in the attic of
                    Smulders’ paper warehouse on Laan. There I found — guess what — double Ingres
                    under the name Papier Torchon: it was a type with an even coarser grain than
                    yours. I’m sending you a sample to show you. There’s a whole batch — already old
                    and mature, excellent. I bought only half a quire for now, but I can always go
                    back later. I was there in search of something else, namely the Honig paper that
                    I have now and then, very cheap, from an undelivered order for the land
                    registry. That is very suitable for charcoal drawing, I believe, and comes in
                    large sheets tinted rather like the Harding type. As you see, this sample has a
                    grain as coarse as a piece of sailcloth. What you brought is a nicer colour and
                    wonderful, for example, for studies of the sides of ditches and soils. However,
                    I’m glad to have discovered this new batch. Well, old chap, many thanks for
                    everything, a handshake in thought; I’m going to start work. Give Pa and Ma my
                    warmest regards, thank them for what they gave you for me, and tell them I’ll
                    write soon — but as agreed not about special matters. Adieu — enjoy yourself,
                    and have a safe return to your ordinary work, and believe me </p>
            </body>

            <salutation>My dear Theo, </salutation>
            <body>
                <p>In the days since you left I’ve done some experimenting with painting. And
                    thought you might be curious to know how I’m getting on. I do wish that you
                    could be back in the studio for just an hour — that would be the best way to
                    tell you how it turned out. Since that is, of course, impossible, I just want to
                    say that I have 3 painted studies. One of a row of pollard willows in the meadow
                    (behind the Geestbrug), then a study of the cinder road close to my
                    neighbourhood — and today I was again in the vegetable gardens in Laan van
                    Meerdervoort, where I found a potato field with a ditch. A man in a blue smock
                    and a woman were gathering up the potatoes, and I put their figures in. The
                    field was white, sandy ground — half dug over, half still covered by rows of
                    dried stalks — with green weeds in between. In the distance dark green and a few
                    roofs. I took the greatest pleasure in doing the last study in particular. I
                    must say that painting is not as alien to me as you might think. On the
                    contrary, I find it very appealing on account of it being a powerful means of
                    expression. </p>
                <p>And at the same time one can say delicate things with it too — let a soft grey or
                    green speak in the midst of roughness. I’m very glad that I have the necessary
                    equipment, because in the past I often had to restrain myself. It opens up a
                    much broader horizon. Now I would like quietly to amass a good number of painted
                    studies to hang in my studio without referring to this as a change. And should
                    anyone express surprise at seeing painted work by me, to say: Well, did you
                    think I had no feeling for that or couldn’t do it? But I’ve put a lot of work
                    into drawing and will continue to do so, because it’s the backbone of painting,
                    the skeleton supporting everything else.<unstress reason="career"> I’m enjoying
                        it so much</unstress>, Theo, that I’ll have to restrain rather than push
                    myself because of the costs. These studies are of medium size, though slightly
                    larger than the lid of an ordinary painting box, because I don’t work in the
                    lid, but instead pin the painting paper for the study to a frame with canvas
                    stretched across it, which is easy to carry. Before I paint bigger things, I’ll
                    draw them bigger. Or, if I can find out the technique — I’ll look into it — make
                    what they call grisailles of them. </p>
                <p> It becomes too expensive a business if you’re not sparing with the paint. But,
                    old chap, it’s wonderful for me that I’ve once again been given so many good
                    tools — thanks again for everything. I’ll do my best to ensure that you need
                    have no regrets, but rather the satisfaction of seeing the progress made. I’m
                    writing now just for the time being to say that I’ve made a start. It goes
                    without saying that the studies must become more beautiful — and that certainly
                    they have their shortcomings too — but I believe that even in these first ones
                    you’ll already see that there’s something of the open air in them, something
                    that proves I have a feeling for nature and the heart of a painter. Herewith a
                    small scratch of Laan van Meerdervoort. The vegetable gardens there have a sort
                    of Old Dutch cachet that always appeals to me. Well, good-night, it’s late, with
                    a handshake. </p>

            <close>Ever yours, </close>
            <sig>Vincent</sig>
            <ps>
                <p>I’m busy with Zola’s ‘La curée’. </p>

                <p>When I’d written this letter, I realized that it lacked something. I thought — I
                    must ensure that I can write to him that I’ve tackled a piece of sand, sea and
                    sky like we saw together at Scheveningen. Then I kept my letter back and marched
                    off to the beach this morning, and have just got back with a fairly large
                    painted study of sand, sea and sky, and a few fishing-boats and men on the
                    beach. There’s still dune sand in it, and I assure you this won’t be the last
                    one. I thought you’d be pleased that I’ve tackled this. </p>


                <p>As said, I want to make sure that when you come again, in six months or a few
                    months or a year, the studio has become a painter’s studio. These scratches were
                    done in great haste, as you can see. Now that it’s going well, I’ll try to
                    strike while the iron’s hot and carry on painting for a little. <stress
                        reason="money">If you can send the usual towards the 20th, there’s no
                        question but that I’ll be able to occupy myself exclusively with it for a
                        while</stress>. I believe that after a month of regular painting the studio
                    will look completely different. Hoping that this will please you, I shake your
                    hand again, and warmly wish you good fortune in everything. </p>

            </ps>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="money">As I write to you, I’m already down to my last guilder. I
                        hope to hear from you soon but, bearing in mind what you last wrote to me I
                        think it very possible that you may not be able to spare the usual precisely
                        on the twentieth. If that’s the case, I want to ask you to send whatever you
                        can spare, be it more or less, even if it’s only a small part.</stress> A
                    model is coming on Friday afternoon, a man from the almshouse, and I wouldn’t
                    like to send him away unpaid. I had some extra expenditure because my painting
                    box got broken when I jumped from a high bank and, trying to grab my things as
                    quickly as possible, had to get out of the way of a skittish horse in the
                    Rijnspoor yards where they stockpile the coal. It’s very beautiful there — I had
                    to ask permission to paint there, since it’s not a public area, and now hope to
                    be there often. Meanwhile, on that occasion I painted the mounds of coal there,
                    where men were pottering about, and there was a horse and cart. I also did a
                    study of a courtyard with a bleaching ground and sunflowers. </p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="environment">It’s splendid outdoors. The leaves are all manner
                        of bronze colours — green, yellow, reddish — all warm and rich. I do so wish
                        that you could see everything together — since your visit the studio has
                        taken on a completely different appearance.</unstress>
                    <stress reason="money">It’s true that I’ve had to spend quite an
                        amount,</stress> but now there are a good number of painted studies on the
                    walls.</p>
                <p>The courtyard and all that coal were so beautiful that I couldn’t resist them,
                    although this week I wanted to draw because of the paint. I would very much
                    like, and am working towards this, to put things in my studio that will remind
                    me when I see them each morning of this or that outdoors. So that I immediately
                    know what to do with the day — and <unstress reason="environment">immediately
                        take pleasure in something</unstress>, or have the feeling: I must still go
                    here or there sometime. As regards sending you a painted study, I have nothing
                    against that — but before I do, we must agree on a couple of things. </p>
                <p>Someone like Mauve — any artist — undoubtedly has his own distinctive colour
                    range. But no one had it on the first day, and in studies done out of doors it
                    isn’t immediately apparent, even with painters who are much more experienced
                    than I am. Especially the studies by Mauve, which I find very beautiful
                    precisely because of their soberness, and because they’re done with such
                    fidelity. Yet they lack a certain charm which the paintings derived from them
                    have in great measure. And in my case the position is that, for example, the
                    seascape I brought home most recently is already very different in colour from
                    the first or second I started with. </p>
                <p>So you must make no judgement about my colour on the basis of what I can send
                    now. And if I would really prefer to wait until things are riper before sending,
                    it’s because I believe I’ll change a great deal in colour. And in composition
                    too. So that’s the first thing, and the second is that studies done out of doors
                    are different from paintings intended to go out into the world. In my view the
                    latter stem from the studies, but may, and indeed must, differ from them
                    markedly. For in the painting the artist presents a more personal idea, and in a
                    study his aim is simply to analyze a piece of nature. Either to give his thought
                    or conception precision, or to arrive at a thought. Thus studies belong more in
                    the studio than in the trade, and shouldn’t be looked at from the same viewpoint
                    as paintings. </p>
                <p>Well, I believe that you’ll take the same view and will naturally take these
                    things into consideration. But write and tell me what you’d like me to do, and
                    rest assured that as regards sending or not sending yet I’ll do what seems best
                    to you. But what I would like most of all would be for you to see everything
                    together — is there any possibility that you could come again in the winter
                    sometime? If so, I certainly think it would be better if I don’t send. Anyway.
                    But rest assured that I pay close attention to whatever you say about the work
                    with a view to saleability and bear it in mind, and don’t imagine that I treat
                    your opinion lightly. I regard making studies as Sowing, and making paintings as
                    reaping. </p>
                <p>I believe that one thinks much more healthily when the ideas arise from direct
                    contact with things than when one looks at things with the aim of finding this
                    or that in them. It’s the same with the question of the use of colour. There are
                    colours that are naturally beautiful seen together, but I do my best to make it
                    as I see it, before I set to work to make it as I feel it. And yet, feeling is a
                    big thing, and without that one would produce nothing. Sometimes I can yearn for
                    harvest time, that is, the time when I’ll be so permeated by the study of nature
                    that I myself will create something in a painting, yet analyzing things isn’t a
                    burden to me or something I dislike doing. It’s already late — I sleep so badly
                    at present — but it’s that wonderful nature of autumn that’s on my mind, and the
                    worry about getting something out of it. However, I wish I could get some sleep
                    now and then, and do my best, for it makes me nervous, but nothing helps. </p>
                <p>But how are things with you? I do hope you don’t have too many worries, because
                    that doesn’t help really. I believe that I would soon be miserable if I didn’t
                    have so much fresh air and enjoyed painting less. But being outdoors and working
                    on something that stimulates are things that renew and sustain one’s strength.
                    It’s only at times when I’m <bad_health> overtired that I feel thoroughly
                        wretched</bad_health>, yet as to my health, I believe I’ll recover. Adieu,
                    accept a handshake in thought, and write and tell me what I should do — send you
                    a painted study, or not yet. And rest assured that I think of you every day, and
                    believe me</p>

            </head>
            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Your latest letter with the enclosure reached me in good order, and I thank you
                    right heartily for it. <stress reason="money">I was and even still am in a bit
                        of a spot — that is, with a view to painting. There are all kinds of costs
                        involved.</stress> But that’s also partly because many of the things that I
                    begin don’t come off, and then one has to start again and the effort comes to
                    nothing, except that this is the way to make progress, and that one must
                    persevere.</p>
                <p>There was no answer in your last letter to what I said about sending or not
                    sending painted studies. Perhaps it slipped your mind. Now, I decided that it
                    wasn’t a weighty matter after all, and so <work origin="new" stage="finished"
                        >today I’ve sent you a painted study by post.</work> But, as I said in my
                    last letter, I would of course rather you could see them all together sometime,
                    and it goes without saying that you mustn’t judge the future by this one, since
                    I haven’t been working with the brush long enough for me not to change a great
                    deal. I wanted to send you a different one, <work origin="new" stage="finished"
                        >but the others I would rather have sent aren’t yet dry enough for me to
                        risk rolling them up.</work>
                </p>
                <p>Like me, you will no doubt have reservations about the background in particular.
                    The only explanation I can offer about this is that the study was done as a
                    study of the foreground, namely the tree roots; a lot of work had already gone
                    into them, and as usual I wasn’t sitting peacefully because of passers-by, and
                    so when I had got the study to the point you see I couldn’t bear it any more.
                        <stress reason="environment">You can’t imagine how wearying and irritating
                        it is that people always gather round so close.</stress>
                    <bad_health>It makes me so nervous sometimes that I have to give
                        up.</bad_health> Just yesterday morning, although it was very early and I
                    hoped to be spared, a study of the chestnut trees on Bezuidenhout (which are so
                    splendid now) was a failure because of it. <stress reason="environment">And
                        sometimes they’re so nasty and insolent.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>Oh well. But it’s not just the regrets that one has — there’s also the cost of
                    the paint, etc., which can’t be recovered. Of course things like that won’t get
                    on top of me, and I’ll fight my way through them just as others do, but I do so
                    feel that I could reach my goal much faster if there were fewer of these petty
                    vexations. Now, as regards this study — if it’s the case that, on seeing it and
                    knowing that I have many others as well as this one, you don’t regret enabling
                    me to make it, then I’ll be content and shall carry on in good heart. If you’re
                    disappointed, remember that I started only a short time ago; if you’re pleased,
                    so much the better for me, for I would so much like to be able in time to send
                    you something that gave you pleasure.</p>
                <p>Now I must tell you that <unstress reason="love">I had a very unexpected and very
                        pleasing visit from Pa,</unstress> who came to my house and to the studio,
                    which I believe is infinitely better than his only hearing about me through
                    reports from others. If people visit me, then at least their impression is
                    original, but I don’t like opinions based on what people say. <good_health>It
                        really gave me great pleasure to see Pa and talk to him.</good_health> I’ve
                    again heard a lot about Nuenen — that churchyard there with the old crosses
                    won’t leave me alone, I do so hope that in time I’ll get round to doing it. I
                    also heard a lot about your visit, and that you had given them that engraving
                    after Israëls, which touched them deeply. <work origin="new" stage="finished"/>
                    — I could send the first, but since then I’ve caught the colour of the sea
                    better, and so I’m waiting until a later one is thoroughly dry. Recently,
                    though, I’ve painted considerably more than in the original plan we discussed.
                    But perhaps it’s necessary to continue doing this if it’s at all possible.</p>
                <p>I received a letter from Rappard the other day. I wish he lived a little closer.
                    And rest assured that I’m truly glad to hear your comments, just as they come
                    into your mind. I often feel a desire and need to seek advice from someone on
                    various questions, but after what happened with Mauve I don’t give in to that,
                    and I don’t discuss my work with painters. However brilliant someone may be,
                    what good is it to me if he argues differently from the way he works? I would
                    rather M. had spoken to me about the use of body-colour instead of saying:
                    ‘Above all, you mustn’t use body-colour’, while he himself and all the others,
                    so to speak, nearly always use it, and to the best effect. Well, in many cases
                    one can gradually find out things by looking for oneself as well, and I’m doing
                    that as best I can.</p>
                <p>Yes — if it were so that I could do exactly what I wanted, I would take up
                    painting on a somewhat larger scale and, above all, work much more with a model.
                    I draw many figures in my spare moments. The small figure in this study is
                    actually there simply and solely for the size, so that if I do use the study I
                    can find the proportion of any figure, more or less. Of course, a proper figure
                    is a very different matter and involves a great deal more. It’s also there to
                    provide an accent. Make no mistake, old chap, I send you this because, since you
                    said nothing about it, I didn’t know what to do. Of course I intend something
                    very different from this, and I’m sending it in the same way that I make a
                    scratch sometimes, to give you an idea of what I’m working on.</p>
                <p>Adieu, accept a handshake in thought. I hope that all is as well with you as
                    possible, and that your headache isn’t something that lasts or keeps coming
                    back. I have it too sometimes, more as a sense of unpleasant dullness than
                    severe pain. Pa and I went for a walk on Rijswijkseweg, it’s lovely there
                    too.</p>

                <p>If this arrives safely, then this is an easy way of sending you things
                    occasionally. I don’t know whether one can send drawings or paintings by post as
                    printed matter. Another thing, you understand that I could do some things
                    differently, for example some branches &amp;c., if I painted them again — but I
                    think that one shouldn’t tinker with studies if they’re to be of any use. They
                    should be hung up in the studio just as they come out of the woods. For some
                    they may be less pleasing, but there’s more of his impression in them for the
                    painter himself.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Just a word to say that your letter arrived in good order, I thank you heartily
                    for the contents. These last few days I’ve done almost nothing but watercolours.
                        <work origin="new" stage="sketch">A scratch of a large one is
                        enclosed.</work> You may remember Mooijman’s state lottery office at the
                    beginning of Spuistraat. I passed it one rainy morning when a throng of people
                    were standing there waiting to get lottery tickets. For the most part they were
                    old women and the sort of people of whom it’s impossible to say what they do or
                    how they live, but who evidently potter along and fret and get on with life. Of
                    course, viewed superficially, a crowd of folk who evidently attach so much
                    importance to ‘Draw today’ is something that almost makes you and me laugh,
                    because we’re not in the least bit interested in the lottery. But the group of
                    people — and their waiting expression — struck me, and it took on a larger,
                    deeper meaning for me while I was working on it than in the first moment. It
                    becomes more meaningful, I believe, if one thinks of it as the poor and
                    money.</p>
                <p>That, in fact, applies to nearly all figure groups: one occasionally has to think
                    about them for a while before one understands what one is seeing. The curiosity
                    and delusion about the lottery seem more or less childish to us, but it becomes
                    serious when one thinks about the other side: misery and forlorn attempts by
                    these poor souls to be saved, so they think, by buying a lottery ticket, paid
                    for with pennies saved by going without food. <work origin="new" stage="middle"
                        >Be that as it may, I’m working on a large watercolour of it.</work>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <work origin="new" stage="middle">I’m also working on one of a church pew that I
                        saw in a small church in the Geest district where the almsmen go</work>
                    (they’re known here very expressively as ORPHAN men and orphan women). The way
                    things are going, being busily drawing again, <unstress reason="environment">I
                        sometimes think there’s nothing so pleasant as drawing.</unstress> This is
                    part of the bit with pews; there are other men’s heads in the background. Things
                    like this are difficult, though, and won’t come off in one go. Success is
                    sometimes the outcome of a whole string of failures.</p>
                <p>Speaking of orphan men, I was interrupted while writing this by the arrival of my
                    model. And I worked with him until it got dark — wearing a big old overcoat
                    which gave him a curiously broad figure. I believe you might perhaps enjoy this
                    collection of orphan men in their Sunday and working clothes. Then I also
                    tackled him sitting with a pipe. He has an interesting bald head — big ears (NB.
                    Deaf) and white sideboards. <work origin="new" stage="sketch">I did this scratch
                        half in the dark, but perhaps it can give you an idea of the
                        composition.</work> Once it has been put together, something like this can
                    be quickly scribbled down. Putting it together was less easy, and I don’t claim
                    that it stands now as I wanted to have it. I would enjoy painting it with
                    figures the length of roughly one foot, or slightly less, with the composition
                    then a little broader. However, I don’t know whether I’ll do it. I’d need a
                    large canvas, and if it didn’t work there might be considerable costs involved.
                    I also think — although I would greatly enjoy it — that I’ll come to things like
                    that of my own accord, by continuing to do types of figures. Then later it will
                    come naturally from the studies from the model, either in this or another form,
                    but with the same sentiment.</p>
                <p>I’m becoming more and more aware of how useful and very necessary it is to keep
                    studies from the model. Though they have less value for others, the person who
                    has made them recognizes the model in them, and things are brought vividly to
                    mind again. When there’s an opportunity, remember to send some of the old
                    studies back to me. <work origin="new" stage="planned">I hope in time to use
                        them to make more beautiful things.</work> It goes without saying that there
                    were wonderful colours in the group of figures of which I’m sending you a black
                    scratch — blue smocks and brown jackets, white, black, yellowish worker’s
                    trousers, faded shawls, an overcoat turned greenish, white caps and black top
                    hats, muddy paving-stones and boots contrasting with pale faces or ones
                    weathered by the elements. And that’s where painting or watercolouring comes in.
                    Well, I’m toiling away at it. I count on you to write again, of course, but
                    thank you again for sending the money in good time, which is badly needed if I’m
                    to carry on vigorously.</p>

                <p>There’s a little more foreground in the watercolour — here the figures are too
                    far forward and one’s eye doesn’t grasp the foreground enough.</p>

                    don’t know whether I’ll be able to get them to a high enough standard, but we
                    must do what we can and struggle on until we get there. Then, the large one of
                    which I sent you a scratch in my last letter is coming along well. I definitely
                    think that you’d be pleased by what I’m working on. Like me, you would also see
                    immediately that I need a mass of figure studies. I’m putting all my efforts
                    into that, and working almost every day with a model. I’ve done more of the
                    orphan man since, and this week I hope to get a woman from the home as well.
                        <stress reason="money">I’m desperately short of money, though. So many

                <p>Imagine, this week to my great surprise I received a package from home — with a

                        was very touched.</unstress> The churchyard with the wooden crosses is often
                    on my mind, so I may do some studies for it in advance – I would like to do
                    something like that in the snow – a peasant funeral or the like. In short, an
                    effect like the enclosed scratch of miners. Just to complete the seasons, <work
                        origin="new" stage="sketch">I’m sending a scratch of spring and one of
                        autumn with it, which I thought of while making the first.</work> How
                    beautiful it is outdoors — I’m doing my best to capture autumnal effects.</p>
                <p>I’m writing to you in great haste, I assure you that there’s a lot involved in
                    compositions with figures, and I’m very busy. It’s like weaving: you have to
                    give it all your attention to keep the threads apart; you must control and keep
                    an eye on several things at once. The small drawing of the beach is more
                    finished than the others because it was used to determine the size, while the
                    others are less watercolour. Well, I sincerely hope your pockets aren’t too
                    empty — it’s so very beautiful these days that I must get something of it on
                    paper. </p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>It’s Sunday again, and again as rainy as usual. On top of that we’ve had a gale
                    this week and the leaves are thinning out on the trees. Believe me, I’m glad
                    that the stove is in place. This morning, when I at last got round to sorting
                    out my drawings, namely the studies from the model done since about the time of
                    your visit (not counting the older studies nor what I draw in my sketchbook),
                        <work origin="existing" stage="sketch">I found about one hundred.</work> I
                    just mention this figure because I remember that on the occasion of your visit
                    you asked me if I had other studies as well as the drawings you saw then. I
                    don’t know whether all painters work harder than I do, <stress
                        reason="environment">even those who look down on my work very
                        loftily,</stress> so much so that they consider it beneath them to take the
                    slightest notice of it. Nor do I know whether they know a better way than
                    working with models, although in my view they do that too little, as I’ve
                    written to you more than once, saying that I couldn’t understand why they don’t
                    make more use of models. (Of course I do not mean people like Mauve or Israëls,
                    although the latter sets an excellent example in my view by always working with
                    a model, but more gentlemen like Bock and Breitner, say.) I haven’t seen
                    anything at all of the latter since I visited him in hospital when he was ill —
                    by chance I heard something about his having become a teacher at a secondary
                    school — but I haven’t had the slightest sign of life from him himself.</p>
                <p>This week I received a letter from Rappard, who’s also surprised by the behaviour
                    of many painters here, and had the experience, among other things, of having one
                    of his paintings refused at Arti. <stress reason="environment">I say only this:
                        if the likes of he and I are rated as nothing, is that fair?</stress> For I
                    assure you that he works hard; he was in Drenthe this summer, and after that he
                    worked for a long time in the hospital for the blind in Utrecht. I found it
                    curious to hear from him of several experiences that were roughly or exactly the
                    same as my own.</p>
                <p>But anyway. As I’ve written to you before, <stress reason="friendship">I often
                        long for you.</stress> If I saw more of you and we were able to discuss the
                    work more, I could make several things that should be possible to make from the
                    studies I have. I’m convinced of that. Still — you remember that not long ago I
                    wrote (when I sent you a small scratch of a potato market): ‘I must have another
                    go at tackling that bustle on the street’. <work origin="new" stage="middle">The
                        result is now some 12 watercolours that I’m working on at the moment.</work>
                    So I do not mean by the above that I can’t achieve anything with my studies or
                    that I do them without any aim, but only that I believe I could achieve more
                    with them and make them more immediately effective if I could discuss things
                    with you more often. But be that as it may, <unstress reason="environment">I do
                        work with great pleasure these days</unstress>, and I do have hope that
                    there will be some things which you too will take pleasure in, when you next
                    come.</p>
                <p>I believe that if one wants to do figures one must have a warm sense within
                    oneself of what Punch in the Christmas illustration calls Good will to all, that
                    is, that one must have a real love of people. At least I hope to do my best to
                    be in that kind of a mood as much as possible. That’s exactly why I find it such
                    a pity that I don’t get on better with painters, and, as I wrote to you in the
                    past, that on a rainy day like today one can’t just sit cosily by the stove,
                    look at drawings or prints and liven each other up that way. I must ask you
                    whether there are cheap prints by Daumier for sale, and if so, which. I’ve
                    always believed him to be highly gifted, but it’s only recently that I begin to
                    suspect that he’s of even greater importance than I thought. If you know
                    anything special about him, or know of important things among his drawings, do
                    write about them if you will. In the past I saw caricatures by him, and perhaps
                    because of them got an idea about him that wasn’t the right one. His figures
                    always struck me the most, but I believe that I know only a very small part of
                    his work and that, for instance, the caricatures are definitely not his most
                    typical or main work.</p>
                <p>I remember that we talked about this last year on the road to Princenhage, and
                    you said then that you thought Daumier more beautiful than Gavarni, and I took
                    Gavarni’s side and spoke to you of the book about Gavarni that I had read and
                    that you now have. But I must say that, although I still like Gavarni just as
                    much, I begin to suspect that I know only a very small part of Daumier’s work
                    AND THAT IN THE PART OF HIS WORK I DO NOT KNOW are the very things that would
                    interest me most of all (however much I already appreciate what I know by him).
                    And I also dimly remember — but I may be wrong — you telling me about large
                    drawings, types or portraits from the common people, and I’m curious about them.
                    If there were more things by him as beautiful as a print by him I recently
                    found, The 5 ages of a drinker, or as that figure of an old man under a chestnut
                    tree I told you about before, well, then he was perhaps the master of them all.
                    Can you give me any information about this? Do you still remember the figures by
                    Degroux from the Uylenspiegel that I had in the past but not any more, alas? —
                    well, those two prints by Daumier that I just mentioned look like them —and if
                    you know of any more like them — (I care much less about the caricatures) that’s
                    what I’m after.</p>
                <p>I’m terribly sorry that I no longer have the Degroux and Rops. I gave them away
                    in England, along with other things, to Richardson, the traveller for the house
                    of G&amp;Cie. Well, old chap, and I promise you this for when you come, apart
                    from the watercolours and painted studies, I’ll ask you to take the trouble to
                    look through a portfolio with one hundred drawn studies — all figures. I have
                    them already, especially if I include some old ones. In the interval between now
                    and your visit, however, <work origin="new" stage="planned">I’ll try to make
                        better ones to replace others that can be left out, and try to put even more
                        variety into them.</work>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>For several days I’ve been completely taken up by something that may also be of
                    interest to you and I think it well worth writing to you about it especially. In
                    a letter from Rappard I received an extract from a lecture by Herkomer on the
                    subject of the wood engravings of recent times. I can’t tell you about the whole
                    thing in detail, you may have read the article yourself (which was in an English
                    art magazine, perhaps the Art Journal). It was mainly about the drawings in The
                    Graphic. Herkomer relates how he himself worked on them with great ambition and
                    enthusiasm, and he particularly recalls the splendid prints in the first
                    volumes. Feels that no words can express sufficiently forcefully how important
                    he finds the work of those first artists. He reviews the progress made in
                    process and technique, the difference between the old and the modern wood
                    engraving, &amp;c. &amp;c. Then talks about the present day, and that brings him
                    to the real subject of his lecture. He says: the wood engravers are cleverer
                    than ever, but nonetheless I see a decadence if I think back to when The Graphic
                    began. And — he goes on — in my view the reason lies in two things against which
                    I protest. One has to do with the publishers, the other with the artists. Both
                    have their faults, which will ruin things if one doesn’t combat them. The
                    publishers, he says, demand things done for effect: ‘correct and honest drawing
                    is no longer wanted, complete designs are no longer in request, a “bit” just
                    covering an awkward corner of a page, is all that is required’. ‘The managers
                    declare that the public require the representation of a public event or so and
                    are satisfied if it is correct and entertaining, caring nothing for the artistic
                    qualities of the work. I do not believe what they say. The only excuse you may
                    accept is “dearth of good draughtsmen”’. Then he comes to the artists, and says
                    that he regrets that these days all too often it’s the wood engraver, not the
                    draughtsman, who makes the prints beautiful. Urges the artists not to accept
                    this — to draw soberly and forcefully so that the engraver remains what he
                    should be, the translator of the draughtsman’s work, and doesn’t get the upper
                    hand. Then comes his conclusion, a forceful plea to all to continue supporting
                    the cause warmly, and not to allow any weakening.</p>
                <p>There’s something of a reproach in his plea, and it isn’t without some melancholy
                    that he speaks, and as one fighting against the indifference he finds
                    intolerable. ‘To you — the public — the art offers infinite pleasure and
                    edification. For you it is really done. Therefore clamour loudly for good work
                    and be sure it will be forthcoming’ — are his closing words. The whole thing is
                    thoroughly sound, firm, honest. His manner of speaking makes the same impression
                    on me as some letters by Millet. It gives me encouragement, and it truly does me
                    good to hear someone talk like that for once. I say that it’s a terrible pity
                    that here there’s no enthusiasm, so to speak, for the art that’s most suitable
                    for the common people. If the painters were to close ranks to ensure that their
                    work (which, after all, is made for the people, in my view — at least I believe
                    that is the highest, noblest vocation for any artist) could also come into the
                    hands of the people and was put within everyone’s reach, that would be something
                    that would produce the same results as were produced in the first years of The
                    Graphic. Neuhuys, Van der Velden and a few others made drawings this year for
                    ‘De Zwaluw’, a magazine that appears monthly and costs 7 1/2 cents. There are
                    some good ones, but one can see that most were done with a weak hand (not the
                    original drawings but the way of popularizing them), and from what I hear the
                    magazine is no more likely to keep going than its predecessors. Why doesn’t it
                    work? — the booksellers say they earn nothing from it, and instead of
                    circulating it they block it. And as for the painters, I believe they haven’t
                    yet made every effort to take the matter to heart. The definition that many a
                    painter here in Holland gives in reply to the question ‘What is a wood
                    engraving?’ is: ‘it’s those things lying in the Zuid-Hollandsch Koffiehuis’. So
                    they rank them among the drinks. And the makers of them among the drunks,
                    perhaps. And what do the dealers say? Suppose I went to anyone here with around
                    100 sketches that I’ve gathered together. At best I fear I would be told ‘did
                    you imagine those things had commercial value?’</p>
                <p>My love and respect for the great draughtsmen of both the age of Gavarni and of
                    the present day increases the better acquainted with their work I become, and
                    above all as I do my best myself to make something from what one sees every day
                    on the streets. What I value in Herkomer, in Fildes, in Holl and the other
                    founders of The Graphic, why I find and will continue to find them even more
                    sympathetic than Gavarni and Daumier, is that, while the latter seem to view
                    society more with mockery, the former, like such men as Millet, Breton, Degroux
                    and Israëls, choose subjects which — while as true as those of Gav. or Daum. —
                    have something noble and in which there’s a more serious sentiment. That, above
                    all, must remain, it seems to me. An artist need not be a minister or a
                    collector in church, but he must have a warm heart for people, and I find it a
                    noble thing that, for example, no winter passed without The Graphic doing
                    something to keep alive sympathy for the poor. For instance, I have a print by
                    Woodville showing the distribution of turf tickets in Ireland, another by
                    Staniland entitled Help the helpers depicting various scenes in a hospital —
                    where money was short, Christmas in the workhouse by Herkomer, Homeless and
                    hungry by Fildes &amp;c. I find them even more beautiful than the drawings by
                    Bertall or somebody for the Vie Elégante or other élégances. Perhaps you’ll find
                    this a tedious letter — but everything was once more fresh in my mind. I had
                    gathered together and mounted my 100 or so studies and when I had finished the
                    job a slightly melancholy sense of ‘what’s the good?’ came over me — but then
                    Herkomer’s forceful words calling on people not to <unstress reason="career"
                        >weaken and saying that it’s more necessary than ever to keep the hand to
                        the plough did me so much good, and I thought I’d briefly tell you the
                        substance of what he said</unstress>.</p>

                <date>Sunday, 5 November 1882.</date>
            </head>
            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Your letter and its contents were very welcome. A point that will perhaps be
                    raised more and more is the one you refer to. People will be forced to recognize
                    that much of what’s new, in which people at first thought they saw progress, is
                    indeed less sound than the old, and consequently the need will become apparent
                    for strong men to redress the balance. Since I believe arguing about this will
                    make no difference to the matter itself, I think it quite unnecessary to write
                    more about it.</p>
                <p>But for my part I can hardly say that I share your idea that you express as
                    follows: ‘in my view it’s in the nature of things that the desired change will
                    come’. Just think of how many great men have died or... won’t be with us much
                    longer — Millet, Brion, Troyon, Rousseau, Daubigny, Corot — and a host of others
                    — are no more. Think further back, I say, Leys, Gavarni, Degroux (to name just a
                    few), or still further, Ingres, Delacroix, Géricault, think how old it already
                    is, modern art. Add to them many who are aged. Nonetheless, there was still
                    progress up to Millet and Jules Breton in my view, but as for surpassing these
                    two men, don’t talk to me of that. Their genius may be equalled in past, present
                    or later ages, but to surpass them isn’t possible. If one reaches that high
                    zone, one is amid an equality of geniuses, but one can’t climb higher than the
                    top of the mountain. Israëls, for example, may equal Millet, but with genius
                    there’s no question of surpassing or being inferior.</p>
                <p>Now, though, the top has been reached in art. In the years to come we’ll most
                    certainly see splendid things; something more sublime than what we’ve already
                    seen — no. And for my part I fear that in a few years there may be a kind of
                    panic, in this form: since Millet we have sunk very low — the word decadence,
                    now whispered or pronounced in veiled terms (see Herkomer), will then sound like
                    an alarm bell. Many, like I myself, now keep quiet, because they already have
                    the reputation of being awkward customers, and talking about it doesn’t help.
                    That — namely, talking — isn’t what one needs to do — one must work, though with
                    sorrow in the heart. Those who later cry out the loudest about decadence will
                    themselves belong to it the most. I repeat: by this shall ye know them, by their
                    work, and it won’t be the most eloquent who say the truest things. See Millet
                    himself, see Herkomer, they’re certainly not orators, and speak almost
                    reluctantly.</p>
                <p>Enough of this, in you I find someone who understands much about the great men,
                    and I find it delightful to hear things about them now and then that I don’t
                    know, like, for example, what you write to me about Daumier. The series of
                    portraits of politicians &amp;c., the painting of the 3rd-class carriage, the
                    Revolution — I don’t know any of them. Now I haven’t seen them myself through
                    what you say, but in my imagination Daumier’s personality has gained in
                    importance as a result. I would rather hear talk about such men than about the
                    latest Salon, for example.</p>
                <p>Now as for what you write about Vie Moderne, or rather about a type of paper that
                    Buhot promised you. This is something that interests me very much. Do I
                    understand correctly that this paper is such that when one does a drawing on it
                    (I assume in autographic ink), this drawing — without using a second draughtsman
                    or engraver or lithographer as an intermediary — can be transferred as it is
                    onto a stone, or that a print can be made of it, so that any number of
                    impressions can be obtained, the latter then being facsimiles of the original
                    drawing? If this is the case, be so good as to give me all the information you
                    can find about how one should work on this paper, and do your best to send me
                    some of it on which I can do some trials. If I could do my trials before you
                    come, then we could discuss what to do with them at that time.</p>
                <p>I think it possible that within a relatively short time there may be a demand for
                    employees for illustration, more so than at present. If for my part I fill my
                    portfolios with studies from the models that I can grab or catch, I’ll get
                    something to show so that I’ll be eligible, I hope, to be given employment. To
                    keep on illustrating, like for example Morin, Lançon, Renouard, Jules Ferat,
                    Worms in their day, one must have plenty of ammunition in the form of various
                    studies in different fields. I’m trying to gather these together, as you know,
                    and will see in due course. </p>
                <p> By the way, so far I have not yet received the packet of studies which you wrote
                    that you had returned through rue Chaptal. Could they already have arrived at
                    the Plaats? If you think they have, I’ll have them collected, because they’ll be
                    useful to me in connection with things I’ve been doing recently. <work
                        origin="new" stage="sketch">Do you know who I drew this morning? Blok the
                        Jewish bookseller, not David but the short one who’s on the
                        Binnenhof.</work> I wish I had more from that family, for they are a true
                    type. It’s enormously difficult to get the types one would prefer to have — in
                    the meantime I’m content to draw what I can get, without losing sight of the
                    others I would draw if I had the choice. I’m very pleased with Blok. He reminds
                    me of things from many years ago. I hope he’ll come again some other Sunday
                    morning. Naturally, while working one always feels and ought to feel a sort of
                    dissatisfaction with oneself, a desire to be able to do it much better, but
                    still it’s delightful and enjoyable to gradually assemble all kinds of figures —
                    although the more one makes, the more one realizes one needs.</p>
                <p> One can’t do everything at once, but it will be absolutely necessary for me to
                    do a number of horse studies some day, not just scratches on the street but with
                    a model for once. I know of an old white horse, a real nag if ever there was one
                    (at the gasworks), but the man, who makes the poor animal do all manner of heavy
                    jobs and just wants to get what he can out of it, asked a lot for it, namely
                    three guilders to come to me for a morning, a daalder at the very least at his
                    place, provided I came on Sunday. And when you consider that for what I need,
                    namely 30 strong studies, say, I would have to work quite a few mornings, it
                    would cost me too much. But I’ll find a better opportunity sometime. I can get a
                    horse much more easily here and there for a very short time, these people are
                    sometimes willing to do that, but in a very short time one cannot do what really
                    needs to be done, so that’s little help. I try to work quickly, because
                    otherwise it just doesn’t pan out, but a study that’s of some use requires at
                    least half an hour, say, so one always comes back to actual posing. At
                    Scheveningen, for instance, I’ve occasionally had a boy or a man stand still for
                    a moment, as they say, on the beach. The outcome was always a great desire on my
                    part for a longer pose, and standing still for a moment isn’t enough for me,
                    neither for a person nor for a horse. If I’m correctly informed, the draughtsmen
                    for The Graphic whose turn it was always had models at their disposal in a
                    studio at the offices. Dickens has some nice things to say about the painters of
                    his age and their wrong way of working, namely slavishly and yet only half
                    sticking to the model. He says: Fellows, do understand that your model isn’t
                    your ultimate goal but a means for giving body and vigour to your ideas and
                    inspiration.</p>
                <p>Look at the French (Ary Scheffer, for example) and see how much better than you
                    they do it. It’s just as if the English listened to him — they continued working
                    with models, but they learnt to see the model in a grander and bolder way, and
                    learnt to take better advantage of it for sounder and nobler compositions than
                    those of Dickens’s painting contemporaries. Two things that remain eternally
                    true and complement each other, in my view are: don’t snuff out your inspiration
                    and power of imagination, don’t become a slave to the model; and, the other,
                    take a model and study it, for otherwise your inspiration won’t take on material
                    form.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="money">When your letter came there were things I had to pay
                        immediately. I hope it won’t inconvenience you to send again no later than
                        10 Nov.</stress> Understand that the question of that process Buhot spoke to
                    you about strikes me as being pretty important. I would be very pleased if I
                    could learn it, and would like to do my best at it.</p>

            <ps>
                <p>Do you know the effects one sees here early in the morning these days? It’s
                    splendid — it’s what Brion painted in the painting in the Luxembourg, The end of
                    the flood, namely that band of red light on the horizon with rain-clouds above.
                    This brings me to the landscape painters. Compare those of Brion’s time with
                    now. Is it better now than then? I doubt it. I’ll gladly acknowledge that
                    they’re much more productive in that field than in the past, but although I
                    can’t help admiring what they make now, the old landscapes in a more
                    old-fashioned manner always give me pleasure when I see them. There were a few
                    years when I walked past a Schelfhout, for example, and thought something like:
                    that’s not worth the effort. Yet the new, although it takes someone in, doesn’t
                    always continue to make the same strong, moving impression over time, and a
                    naive painting like a Schelfhout or a Ségé, a Jules Bakhuyzen, is seen again
                    with vivid pleasure after one has long been looking at newer things. I really
                    didn’t deliberately set out to be somewhat disenchanted as regards progress; on
                    the contrary, it began to develop unwittingly in my thoughts very much against
                    my will, because as time passed I felt more and more a kind of emptiness which I
                    can’t fill with the things being made today. While searching for an example, I
                    think of old woodcuts by Jacque that I saw at least 10 years ago at C.M.’s. It
                    was a series, The months. They were done in Jacque’s old manner, in the manner
                    of those etchings that appeared in annual series, or even more old-fashioned.
                    The local tone is less in them than in his later work, but the draughtsmanship
                    and a certain terseness are reminiscent of Millet. You see, with the many
                    croquis in the present magazines it seems to me that a not entirely
                    unconventional elegance threatens to replace that typical, truly rustic quality
                    of which the croquis by Jacque that I mean are an example. Might not the cause
                    of this also lie in the lives and characters of the artists? I don’t know what
                    your experience is, but do you find many people these days prepared to go for a
                    long walk in grey weather, for example? You would do it gladly, and enjoy it
                    too, as I would, but for many it would be a chore. Equally, I was struck by the
                    fact that when one talks to painters, in most cases, by far, the conversation is
                    not interesting. When he wants, Mauve has the power to say something in words so
                    that one sees it, and most certainly others here have that too when they want.
                    Yet, that curious fact that when one talks to a painter one immediately has a
                    sense of the open air — is it your impression that that’s as strong as it used
                    to be? This week I read in Forster, Life of C. Dickens, all kinds of details
                    about long walks on Hampstead Heath &amp;c. outside London, the final goal
                    being, for example, to have bacon and eggs at an old inn way out in the country.
                    Those walks were very jolly and cheerful, but all the same it was usually the
                    case that serious plans for books were made, or else the changes Dickens was to
                    make to one character or another were discussed. <stress reason="environment"
                        >The present has something hectic and harried about it for which I do not
                        care, and it’s just as if death has touched everything.</stress> I’d like
                    your expectation ‘that the desired change will come’ to prove true, but in my
                    view it isn’t ‘in the nature of things’. Be this as it may, opposing in words is
                    a complete side issue, I believe, and what everyone who considers the matter
                    important should do in his own circle is to try to make or help to make
                    something. Have been working again on women miners carrying sacks of coal in the
                    snow — watercolour. But above all I’ve drawn 12 or so studies of figures for it,
                    and 3 heads, and I’m not yet finished. I’ve got the effect in the watercolour, I
                    believe, but it isn’t yet strong enough in character for my taste. The reality
                    is like Millet’s The gleaners — austere — so you will understand that one
                    shouldn’t turn it into a snow effect, which would only be an impression and have
                    no raison d’être unless the landscape is the whole point. I think that I’ll
                    start all over again — although the studies I have for now may please you —
                    precisely because I was more successful with them than with many others. It
                    would be really suitable, I believe, for the Vie Moderne. If I get the paper, I
                    already have one of the figures, for example, to do as a trial. But it must
                    become a little troop of women, a small caravan.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Accept my cordial thanks for your registered letter and for the roll. In it I
                    found the paper from Buhot. But I’d like to have some information to go with it,
                    for example, With what does one draw on this paper? Perhaps I’ll be told that
                    later. Renouard’s Children in care are wonderful, also his new drawing, The dock
                    — although the latter is less important than his large prints of the Mazas
                    prison, for example. I’m very pleased with them and thank you for them. <work
                        origin="new" stage="sketch">You’ll have received an impression of a
                        lithograph.</work> Actually it went wrong — but I sent it anyway because
                    there are some bits in it that have turned out as I had intended the whole thing
                    to be. This time the autographic ink ran badly and that had to be corrected
                    later, but there were still black passages everywhere. But look, for example, at
                    the left leg with the muddy boot. There one can see that fabrics can be rendered
                    with this process and curious effects obtained. Hands and head are poor, yet in
                    the other old man they’re the best part.</p>
                <p>Again I watched the transfer to stone and the printing carefully, and I must say
                    that I believe a great deal can be done with this process. Today I was at Van
                    der Weele’s — he took considerable pleasure in the old man with his head in his
                    hands and intends to try it himself. He’s someone who makes truly splendid
                    things sometimes. He gave me 4 etchings, a sheepfold, calves in a copse — two
                    sand-carts and an ox-plough, and I hope to get more later when he has
                    impressions made again. He doesn’t seem to like Tersteeg very much. At least,
                    without my saying anything about him, and while we were talking about Van der
                    W.’s own studies, he said, all right, but if I do this or do that and I go to
                    Tersteeg he makes such and such a remark. I believe he was speaking the truth
                    and, honestly, <stress reason="friendship">I’m very sorry that things are like
                        this. I would rather that I was mistaken in my opinion of Tersteeg, but I
                        fear he rather discourages many who truly deserve something better. How
                        tiresome these matters are.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>Yesterday I received a letter, not from Rappard but from his father, telling me
                    that R. is ill. I don’t know what’s wrong with him — perhaps, perhaps what you
                    and I are also familiar with. The thought occurred to me because of several
                    expressions in his last letter, when he wrote that I should carry on doing
                    experiments and that he felt so feeble that he could do nothing. <stress
                        reason="friendship">What a pity for him, isn’t it?</stress> It’s so hard if
                    one has to stop one’s work right in the middle for such a feeble reason as
                    illness. I’ll very much want to look him up sometime, if I hear that he isn’t
                    getting better quickly. I’ve corresponded with him quite a lot about work
                    recently. He has taken very great pleasure in collecting woodcuts, for example,
                    and I think it highly likely that with time we’ll be more and more help to each
                    other.</p>
                <p>At Van der Weele’s I saw an outstanding sketch by Breitner, a drawing that was
                    unfinished, and perhaps couldn’t be finished. It was of officers deliberating
                    over a map or battle-plan before an open window. Breitner does indeed have a
                    position at the secondary school in Rotterdam. A solution for him. Can one keep
                    that up? Not doing anything else and devoting all one’s time to the work, that’s
                    still preferable in my view. It’s as if there’s something fatal in holding other
                    positions — perhaps it’s precisely the worries, precisely the dark side of the
                    artistic life, that’s the best part of it. It’s risky to say this, and there are
                    moments when one talks differently — many go under because of the worry — but
                    those who struggle through benefit later.</p>
                <p>You write about the question of making drawings in a smaller format. I think it
                    good of you that you speak about this question in a calmer manner than others,
                    who have sometimes said the same thing to me in a very different way and told
                    me, if you don’t work smaller then this will happen and that will happen.
                    Talking about it like that seems to me premature and superficial, and I can’t
                    believe that what they say is true. Do you know what I think — all formats have
                    their pros and cons. In general, for my own study, I definitely need to have the
                    figure in fairly large proportions, so that head, hands, feet aren’t too small
                    and one can draw them robustly. So for my own study I took as my example the
                    format of Bargue’s Exercices au fusain, because that size is easy to take in at
                    a glance and yet the details don’t become too small. But most take a smaller
                    format. </p>
                <p>For my part, from the beginning I’ve done it like this for myself, sometimes a
                    little smaller, sometimes a little larger, and for my own study I would be going
                    against my convictions if I deviated from that. Yet, so although this is for me
                    the focus of my attention — to have the human figure in my power in a good,
                    substantial size — an enormously difficult thing, I do assure you — it’s still
                    the case that I’m by no means absolutely tied to it. And so in reply to what you
                    write I put to you a question in return: do you have a particular work in mind;
                    has someone said something to you like, for instance, if those figures were half
                    the size, sheets of this kind could be used for this or that? And if you know of
                    anything like that, I, for my part, will take the trouble either to reduce
                    figures I already have to half the size, or to draw completely new ones in a
                    smaller format. Without a specific reason I would think it less important than
                    with a specific reason. If it’s so that, were I to send you some figures, say
                    half the size of the last ones, you’d be willing to make new attempts without
                    being able to say at this stage specifically where or what for, that would be
                    reason enough for me to make them. What I just said is only to point out to you
                    how I’ve tried from the outset to maintain a certain order in my work, set a
                    sort of rule for myself, not to be a slave to that rule but because it helps one
                    to think more clearly. Reducing a certain figure to half the size, for example,
                    isn’t difficult at all — although sometimes one loses something of what makes it
                    distinctive — but sometimes the figure gains by it.</p>
                <p>At any rate, I’ll send you a few shortly, but if you have something particular in
                    mind for them, tell me what they’re for — that will help me in the choice of my
                    figures. Thank you again for what you sent. What I wrote to you in my last
                    letter about a plan for making prints for the people is something to which I
                    hope you’ll give some thought one day. I don’t have a fixed plan about this
                    myself as yet, only in order to have it clear in my mind I’ll have things to do
                    relating both to the drawings themselves and to the process of reproduction. But
                    I don’t doubt the possibility of doing something like this, nor its usefulness.
                    Nor can I doubt that people can be found whose heart would be in it. In short, I
                    believe it could be done in such a way that no one would need regret having
                    taken part. </p>
            </body>
            <close>With a handshake.</close>
            <sig>Ever yours, Vincent</sig>
            <ps>
                <p>I’m re-reading your last letter as I write to you. In particular what you say
                    about format. I’d like to give you an example of a draughtsman you know:
                    Théophile Schuler, who illustrated the works of Erckmann-Chatrian. One clearly
                    sees from those small illustrations that he could work excellently on a small
                    scale. One sees it even better in things he did at that time for L’Illustration
                    and Magasin Pittoresque, for example, among them L’Album des Vosges, to which
                    Brion and Jundt also contributed. I believe, though, that it would be a great
                    mistake to imagine that such things as, for instance, the print The grace (a
                    family of woodcutters or peasants at table) were created at a stroke in their
                    final form. No, in most cases the solidity and pith of the small is only
                    obtained through much more serious study than is imagined by those who think
                    lightly of the task of illustrating. Oh, old chap, you’re one of the
                    best-informed art dealers I know, and you speak about this much more accurately
                    and sensitively than most, but if you knew how much hard graft some things have
                    required — for instance, prints from Album des Vosges or those first things in
                    The Graphic — I believe you would be struck by them. With me, at least, it’s
                    often the case that as I learn more about the life and work of fellows like
                    Schuler, Lançon, Renouard, and so many others, I sense that what one sees of
                    them is only the tiny puff of smoke that comes out of their chimney, and that
                    within their heart and studio there’s a great fire. In the illustrated magazines
                    they undergo something like the small tower in the distance that looks very
                    small and insignificant, and when one gets up close proves to be an imposing
                    mass (I mean, only a small part of their work is made public). Anyway, some
                    paintings in their huge frames look very substantial, and later one is surprised
                    when they actually leave behind such an empty and dissatisfied feeling. On the
                    other hand, one overlooks many an unpretentious woodcut or lithograph or etching
                    now and then, but comes back to it and becomes more and more attached to it with
                    time, and senses something great in it. I know a drawing by Tenniel of ‘two
                    clergymen’ (this isn’t the English title, of course, but it’s the subject). One
                    is a city vicar, splendid and broad and imposing; the other is slightly
                    ‘shabby’, evidently a humble village curate, the father of a large and poor
                    family. I often think that one finds these two types among painters as well, and
                    many ‘illustrators’ belong to the village curates among the painters, while
                    perhaps people like Bouguereau or Makart and some others have something of the
                    first type. Now whether, for my part, I have to work in a smaller or larger
                    format makes relatively little difference to me, but what the illustrated
                    magazines ask is only part of what I demand of myself. Of myself I firmly demand
                    that I can make the figure of a size such that head, hands and feet don’t become
                    too small and the details remain clear. This is still very far from being what I
                    require of myself, but for that very reason I must stand firm on that point.
                    When I require this, I’m not making other demands of myself than very many
                    others make of themselves. For example, <work origin="new" stage="middle">with
                        the series of drawings I’m working on now</work> I don’t know what the final
                    form or size will be. After a great deal of thought, I’ve made them about the
                    size of the man with his head in his hands, but I can of course reduce the size
                    of these designs if I wish when it comes to printing. And that there are reasons
                    for drawing the figures fairly large in practice is shown, for example, by
                    Exercices au fusain, Modèles d’après les maîtres, published by G&amp;Cie. I
                    began with them, and so far I haven’t found a better guide to studies from the
                    live model. The book was intended to introduce sound ideas about study, both in
                    the schools and certainly above all in the studios. I’ve listened to what Bargue
                    says in his examples (though my work is far from being as beautiful as his). I
                    believe that they point to a correct way in accordance with what other men
                    taught earlier, among them L. da Vinci — and in any event through it I’ve
                    brought a certain order to my ideas on drawing which results in work proceeding
                    in a better-regulated way than if one imposes no order on one’s actions. You
                    see, that’s something I may not let go of, but, again, if desired, I can reduce
                    the format of this or that figure in my studies. I’d very much like you to see
                    everything I’ve done since this summer all together again. What’s happened to
                    those drawings that you wrote you had sent through rue Chaptal? I haven’t yet
                    received them, but I suspect they’re still with you, since you wrote shortly
                    afterwards that Buhot had seen them. Of course I don’t need them in a hurry, and
                    only mention them in case they may be lying around somewhere. And if you
                    consider it advisable to keep them with you in case you want to talk to someone
                    about them, I have nothing against that, except that I wish you could perhaps
                    make a new selection from the whole lot for that purpose.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>I just received your registered letter and thank you most cordially for it. What
                    I want to begin with is this. Herewith a folder from the 1883 Xmas No. of The
                    Graphic. Do read it carefully, it’s well worth the effort. What a colossal
                    set-up, isn’t it? What huge sales. That said, what then? The following, among
                    other things. Hubert Herkomer’s words are in singular contrast to those of The
                    Graphic’s editors. The latter say, ‘On referring to our books we find that
                    besides our professional artists we have no less than Two thousand seven hundred
                    and thirty friends scattered over the world, sending us sketches or elaborate
                    drawings.’ HH speaks of a: ‘DEARTH OF GOOD DRAUGHTSMEN.’ And in general his
                    words are the diametrical opposite of those of the publishers in this Xmas issue
                    — the whole producing a result in the following form. Graphic publishers say
                    ‘all right’. H.H. says ‘all wrong’.</p>
                <p>Now also see something striking on page 4 of the folder I’m sending: The G. when
                    strong enough to walk alone, rented one house and began to print with six
                    machines. I have every respect for this, I feel something holy here, something
                    noble, something sublime. I’m now looking at that group of great artists and
                    thinking of foggy London and the scurrying about in that small set-up. Deeper in
                    my imagination I see the draughtsmen in their various studios setting to work
                    with the best kind of enthusiasm. I see Millais going up to C. Dickens with the
                    first No. of The Graphic. Dickens was then in the evening of his life, he had a
                    paralyzed foot, walked with a kind of crutch. Millais says, while showing Him
                    the drawing by Luke Fildes, Homeless and hungry — the poor and vagabonds outside
                    a night refuge — Millais says to Dickens, give him your Edwin Drood to
                    illustrate, and Dickens says, ‘Very well’. Edwin Drood was Dickens’s last work,
                    and Luke Fildes, having got in touch with D. through those small illustrations,
                    comes into his room on the day of his death — sees his empty chair standing
                    there, and so it was that one of the old Nos. of The Graphic had that striking
                    drawing THE EMPTY CHAIR.Empty chairs — there are many, more will come, and
                    sooner or later instead of Herkomer, Luke Fildes, Frank Holl, William Small
                    &amp;c. there will only be Empty chairs.</p>
                <p>And still the publishers and dealers, not listening to a prophecy like H.H.’s,
                    will go on assuring us in words like those in the enclosed folder that all is
                    well and that we’re making very good progress. How hard-hearted they are, how
                    mistaken, though, if they think they can fool everyone into believing that
                    material greatness is of equal weight as moral greatness, and that without the
                    latter anything good can be done. As with The Graphic, so with more, many more
                    things in the sphere of art. Moral greatness diminishes, material greatness
                    comes in its place. Whether the desired change will come? It seems to me that
                    everyone must reflect on that for himself, but the old comparison speaks of a
                    broad way ending in desolation, and of a narrow one leading to a different
                    result. The Graphic began on the narrow way and has now moved to the broad one.
                    I saw the latest issue this morning. There was almost nothing good in it. I took
                    an old, torn, dirty issue of 1873 from a pile of scrap paper at a Jewish
                    bookseller’s this morning and am keeping almost everything in it. But as for me
                    — what to do? A few years ago I went walking with Rappard outside Brussels at a
                    spot they call the Vallée de Josaphat, an area where Roelofs lives, among
                    others. There was a sandpit there where diggers were at work — there were women
                    looking for dandelion leaves, a peasant was sowing — we looked at all this and
                    at the time I was half despairing: will I ever succeed in making what I consider
                    so beautiful?</p>
                <p>Now I’m no longer so despairing, now I can capture those peasants and women
                    better than then, and through carrying on working patiently I can arrive at what
                    I wanted, in a sense. But what’s going on weighs heavily on me, and I don’t
                    think of the magazines with pleasure and enthusiasm. The Graphic forgets to say
                    that many in the group of artists are beginning to refuse to give their work,
                    withdrawing more and more. Why? Because a painter works to do something good and
                    has something honest in his heart that finds all that grandeur loathsome. What
                    more shall I say? — repeat ‘What to do?’ once more. Carry on working, of course,
                    but as if with a dark future. Here in The Hague — there are clever, great men, I
                    readily acknowledge that, <stress reason="environment">but in many respects what
                        a wretched state of affairs it is. What intriguing, quarrelling,</stress>
                    envy. And in the personalities of the artists getting rich, who with Mesdag at
                    their head set the tone, also unmistakable signs of material greatness replacing
                    moral greatness.</p>
                <p>I begin to feel in myself that if, for example, I went to England and tried right
                    and left, I would indeed have a chance of finding a place. To achieve that was
                    my ideal, was and is, despite everything, still what spurred me on to overcome
                    the enormous initial difficulties. — — — <bad_health>But my heart becomes heavy
                        at times when I think of what’s going on</bad_health> — my pleasure
                    vanishes. <stress reason="environment">I really want to do my best in my
                        drawings, but all those editors and having to present oneself there —
                        bah!</stress> I shudder at the thought. You ask about my health. What I had
                    last summer really has gone completely, <bad_health>but I’m a little dejected at
                        present,</bad_health> which is combined with other moments, when I’m making
                    progress with the work, <good_health>when I feel very cheerful,</good_health> so
                    that I find it rather like being a soldier who doesn’t feel at home in the
                    guardhouse and thinks to himself: why must I be here in the cooler when I would
                    be more in my rightful place in the ranks? <stress reason="environment">I mean
                        something is weighing on me, since I feel a power in myself which, due to
                        the circumstances, can’t develop as it otherwise would</stress>, and the
                    result is that <bad_health>I’m often wretched.</bad_health> A kind of internal
                    battle over what I must do. Not so easy to resolve as may have appeared at
                    first. I wish I had a position through which I could make progress.</p>
                <p>Many positions that might lie within my reach would lead me to something entirely
                    different from what I mean. They lie beyond my reach for, although I might be
                    taken on initially, with time I wouldn’t be thought right for them. I would be
                    dismissed and I would myself give notice, as with Goupil. I mean, they’d want
                    current events, the day’s news, whatever, for which someone like Adrien Marie or
                    Godefroy Durand would be perfectly suitable. I begin to see ever more clearly
                    that the illustrated magazines go along with the superficial stream, and I
                    believe that they aren’t concerned with being as good as their duty dictates.
                    No, filling the magazines with things that neither cost much nor take much
                    trouble, now and again putting in something good, but produced in a cheap,
                    mechanized way, apart from that filling their pockets with as much money as
                    possible. I don’t think this is a wise course of action. I believe they’ll go
                    bankrupt as a result and be bitterly sorry at the very end, still a long way
                    off. But this doesn’t alter the fact that things are as they are. Renewing
                    themselves — they never give it a thought. Suppose that The Graphic,
                    L’Illustration, Vie Moderne published an issue containing feeble, insipid
                    things. Nonetheless, umpteen cartloads and shiploads would be sold, the managers
                    rub their hands and say, ‘It sells just as well like this, no questions asked,
                    they swallow it anyway’. Yes, but if their lordships the managers could follow
                    their publications and see how thousands eagerly pick up the magazine and then,
                    when they put it aside, instinctively have a feeling of dissatisfaction and
                    disappointment, maybe they’d be less keen to badger people. This isn’t the case
                    at all, though, and as you see from the Graphic report there’s no lack of
                    self-confidence. In the meantime, people have wormed their way in as employees
                    who wouldn’t have appeared in the difficult but noble time.</p>
                <p>What Zola calls the triumph of mediocrity takes place: scoundrels, nobodies,
                    replace workers, thinkers, artists, and no one even notices. The public — yes,
                    on the one hand they’re dissatisfied, but material greatness also garners
                    applause all the same. But don’t forget that this is only a straw fire, and that
                    those who applaud generally do so only because it has become the talk of the
                    town. On the day after the party there’ll be an emptiness and silence, and
                    indifference after all that noise. The Graphic will do Types of beauty (Large
                    heads of women), says this prospectus, no doubt as a replacement for Heads of
                    the people by Herkomer, Small and Ridley. Very well, but some people will not
                    admire the Types of beauty, and will think back with melancholy to the old Heads
                    of the people (a series which has been terminated). The Graphic say they’ll make
                    Chromos!!! Give us back Swain’s studio. You see, Theo, old chap, <stress
                        reason="environment">it truly grieves me, the whole thing is going
                        wrong.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>Listen, I would have counted it the greatest honour, an ideal, to have worked on
                    what The Graphic started. What Dickens was as a writer, what the Household
                    edition of his work was as a publication, that was what that sublime beginning
                    of The Graphic was like. And now, everything’s gone — again the material in
                    place of the moral. Do you know what I think of the folder I’m sending you? It’s
                    just like the way of talking that, for example, Obach, the manager of G&amp;C.
                    in London, goes in for. And that is successful — yes, that is successful, yes,
                    it’s listened to and it’s accepted. Do you know, old chap, what I think of this
                    way of talking in this Graphic folder? It’s like Mesdag’s reasoning about the
                    panorama at the time. I have respect for working, I despise neither Obach nor
                    Mesdag, but there are things that I rate infinitely higher than that sort of
                    energy. I would like something more succinct, something simpler, something
                    sounder; I would like more soul and more love and more heart. Rest assured that
                    I will not and cannot shout out against it, that I will not oppose it.
                        <bad_health>It’s just that it makes me sad, it takes away my pleasure, it
                        upsets me, and I no longer know what I, for my part, should or should not
                        do.</bad_health>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="career">What sometimes saddens me is this — in the past, when I
                        began, I thought when I’ve got this or that far I’ll get a position here or
                        there,</stress> and I’ll be on a straight path and set for life. Now,
                    though, something else has come up, <stress reason="money">and I fear, or rather
                        expect, a kind of guardhouse instead of employment</stress>. I expect things
                    like: yes, this and that in your work is all right (I doubt whether they really
                    mean it), but you must understand that the kind of work you do is unusable; we
                    need current events (vide The Graphic, we print on the Saturday what happened on
                    the Thursday). See, Theo, old chap — I can’t make any TYPES OF BEAUTY — but I
                    will do my best for HEADS OF THE PEOPLE. See, Theo, I would like to do the same
                    as those who began The Graphic (though I don’t consider myself their equal),
                    that is to take a chap or woman or child from the street and do that in my
                    studio. But no, they’d ask: ‘Can you do chromos by electric light?’ Anyway,
                    instead of dealing with a way of thinking, a feeling, a goal like Dickens’s (The
                    Graphic was like that originally), one is presented with a mode of seeing and
                    thinking like Obach’s. <bad_health>That saddens me, and then I feel
                        powerless.</bad_health> Undertaking something oneself is possible only if
                    one encounters interest and cooperation.</p>
                <p> This brings us to another area. Excuse me if I tell you my thoughts and continue
                    to do so. If you don’t have time to write and don’t reply immediately, at least
                    you’ll know when we meet again what preoccupies me, and perhaps we’ll find a
                    passable path. I thought this folder from The Graphic was something through
                    which one can say more clearly what one means, and that’s why I write this for
                    the present.</p>

            </head>
            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Though I’ve nothing special to tell you, I wanted to write to you again. As
                    against what I wrote to you, that I’m often heavy-hearted about many things,
                    can’t see everything as progress, &amp;c., there’s what I also said on a
                    previous occasion: there are things that are worth doing one’s best for, either
                    because they gain approval or because, just the opposite, they have their own
                    raison d’être. Blessed is he who has found his work, says Carlyle, and that’s
                    absolutely true. And as for me, when I say that I want to make figures from the
                    people for the people, then it goes without saying that the course of events
                    will influence me only indirectly, that is to the extent that my work is made
                    harder or easier, but making the drawings themselves is my main preoccupation.
                    And so, as against a feeling of dejection, there’s the fact that it’s a delight
                    to work on something that becomes more interesting the deeper you get into
                    it.</p>
                <p>I said in my last letter that I sometimes had a feeling of being in a sort of
                    guardhouse or prison, by which I simply mean that there are many things I can’t
                    pursue which I would like to — <stress reason="money">they’d only become
                        possible if I could pay for them</stress> — but I don’t at all mean by this
                    that I don’t appreciate the present or am discontented. Far from it. It’s
                    precisely by doing what is attainable that one has a chance of working one’s way
                    up, so be assured that if you ever know of work I could do for the illustrated
                    magazines there, I would be happy to do my best for them. When I write: I don’t
                    think the illustrated magazines are going about it the right way, that’s no
                    reason for me not to want to work for them. It’s just that I fear what I do
                    wouldn’t suit them. If this is due to genuine mistakes, I’ll try to correct
                    them, but if it was because of conception or mood in general, there’s little I
                    could do about it. <work origin="new" stage="sketch">You’ll have received the
                        drawing in a smaller format</work>, and I repeat once more that if you like
                    I’ll make a series in that size to try it out. </p>
                <p>
                    <work origin="new" stage="sketch">I now have two more drawings —</work> one is a
                    man reading the Bible and the other is a man saying his prayers before his
                    midday meal, which is on the table. Both are most decidedly in what one might
                    call an old-fashioned sentiment, they are ditto figures as the old man with his
                    head in his hands. The grace is the best, I believe, but they complement each
                    other. In the one there’s a view through the window of snow-covered furrows. My
                    intention with these two and with the first old man is one and the same, namely
                    to express the special mood of Christmas and New Year. At that time, in both
                    Holland and in England, there’s still always a religious element, everywhere in
                    fact, at least in Brittany and Alsace too. Leaving aside whether or not one
                    agrees with the form, it’s something one respects if it’s sincere, and for my
                    part I can fully share in it and even feel a need for it, at least in the sense
                    that, just as much as an old man of that kind, I have a feeling of belief in
                    something on high even if I don’t know exactly who or what will be there. </p>
                <p>I like what Victor Hugo said: religions pass, but God remains. And Gavarni also
                    said a fine thing: the point is to grasp what does not pass in what passes. One
                    of the things that will not pass is the something on high and belief in God,
                    even if the forms change, a change as necessary as the renewal of greenery in
                    the spring. But you will understand from one thing and another that my aim in
                    these drawings is not to pay homage to the form but to show that I greatly
                    respect the Christmas and New Year sentiment. And if there’s any sentiment or
                    expression in it, that’s because I myself share it.</p>
                <p>What I feel more and more is that it’s difficult to discover the best way to
                    work. There’s so much that is fine on the one side, and so much on the other
                    side too, moreover so much that is wrong, that sometimes one doesn’t know which
                    way to choose. But at all events one must work. Yet for my part I do not think
                    that I couldn’t make a mistake, am too aware of many mistakes to be able to say:
                    this or that is the right way, that is the wrong one. This goes without saying.
                    But I’m not indifferent, I believe it’s wrong to be so, I believe that it’s a
                    duty — even though one knows that one can’t get through the world without making
                    mistakes, without remorse or sorrows — to try to do right. I once read
                    somewhere, Some good must come by clinging to the right. What do I know of
                    whether I’ll attain this or that goal — how can I know in advance whether or not
                    the difficulties will be insuperable? One must work on in silence and await the
                    outcome accordingly. If one prospect vanishes another will perhaps open up —
                    there must be a prospect and a future too, even though its geography is unknown.
                    The conscience is a man’s compass, and although the needle deviates sometimes,
                    although above all one detects inaccuracies in one’s orientation, one must
                    nevertheless do one’s best to set one’s course by it. </p>
                <p>I must copy out something for you that I had in mind when working on that old
                    man, though it doesn’t apply to it literally, since it isn’t nighttime in the
                    drawing, for example. Oft, in the stilly night. Oft in the stilly night, Ere
                    slumber’s chain has bound me, Fond memory brings the light Of other days around
                    me; The smiles, the tears, Of boyhood’s years, The words of love then spoken;
                    The eyes that shone, Now dimm’d and gone, The cheerful hearts now broken! Thus,
                    in the stilly night, Ere slumber’s chain hath bound me, Sad memory brings the
                    light Of other days around me. Laurillard after Moore. When I remember all The
                    friends, so link’d together, I’ve seen around me fall, Like leaves in wintry
                    weather; I feel like one Who treads alone Some banquet-hall deserted, Whose
                    lights are fled, Whose garlands dead, And all but he departed! Thus, in the
                    stilly night, Ere slumber’s chain hath bound me, Sad memory brings the light Of
                    other days around me. <unstress reason="environment">Well, I hope that you too
                        will be able to enjoy something of nature in the coming days, either in the
                        appearance of the short winter days or in the winter figures.</unstress> For
                    how very different passers-by on the street look in winter and in summer.</p>
                <p>I’ve studied your information as to the Buhot paper sent. If you think it
                    advisable for me to do some work on it, I would need a few sheets, and I take it
                    that they’re perhaps made in suitable formats so that I can adapt to them. This
                    paper is not obtainable here, otherwise I would already have tried it. After
                    reading your explanation I’m also left with the question: if one takes a
                    photograph of the drawing, and then transfers the photo to zinc, is it only the
                    drawings done on this particular paper that are suitable for this, and isn’t it
                    possible to reproduce all drawings in black and white, even if they’re on
                    ordinary paper? Also: doesn’t the photographer then have it in his power to
                    reduce the format, should the drawing be larger than desirable for the format of
                    the magazine? The latter is certainly what I would deduce from some American
                    reproductions that appeared in Scribner’s Magazine.</p>
            </body>
            <close>Well, adieu, I hope you’ll write again towards the twentieth. With a handshake in
                thought.</close>

                <date>Wednesday, 3 January 1883.</date>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>I wrote to you yesterday, but I’m doing so again today to report the safe arrival
                    of your letter and to thank you for it, and to tell you that <unstress
                        reason="friendship">what you wrote raised my spirits.</unstress> I was a bit
                    concerned that, because you’ve seen so little of my work recently, this might
                    make you think that I’d begun to slacken off. I have in fact been slogging away
                    lately, and am still wrapped up in various things in which I begin to see light
                    as to how to do them, but which I haven’t yet got the hang of as I would like.
                    In my last letter I told you I was experimenting in Black and White with
                    lithographic crayon. You speak too highly of me in your letter, <unstress
                        reason="love">but the fact that you think highly of me is an added reason
                        for me to try not to be entirely unworthy of it.</unstress> And as for my
                    saying I believed I had made some progress through those experiments, it may be
                    that I can’t see my own work properly. Perhaps it’s a step forward, perhaps not.
                    Tell me your opinion about that based on the <work origin="new" stage="middle"
                        >accompanying two studies, which I made in the past few days, together with
                        some others.</work>
                </p>
                <p>While I search for a more powerful process than the one I’ve worked with up to
                    now, I try to be guided to some extent by the English reproductions made using
                    the process you described — together with the black scratches Buhot made on the
                    sample paper — as to the strength of black. And if you get a chance, speak to an
                    expert about whether it would be possible to reproduce drawings like these (as
                    distinct from the second question of whether these or similar ones were to their
                    particular taste). As for their sentiment, I would like to know what YOU think
                    about that, because, as I said, I myself can’t judge whether there’s more in
                    them or not. Or rather, my position is that for my part I’d rather see studies
                    like these, even though they’re unfinished and even if much is completely
                    neglected, than drawings that have a subject, because through them I get a vivid
                    memory of nature itself. You’ll understand what I mean.</p>
                <p>True studies have something of life itself, and the person who makes them will
                    respect not himself but nature in them, and hence prefer the study to what he
                    may make of it later. Unless something entirely different arises from it as the
                    final outcome of many studies, namely the type distilled from many individuals.
                    That is the highest art, and in that art is sometimes above nature — — — as, for
                    instance, in Millet’s sower, in which there is more soul than in an ordinary
                    sower in the field.</p>
                <p>But what I’d like to know from you is whether you think that this way of working
                    would perhaps remove some of the objections you had to pencil. They’re a few
                    ‘heads of the people’, and my intention would be to find a large number like
                    these to try to form a sort of entity that wouldn’t be entirely unworthy of the
                    title ‘heads of the people’. Through working hard, old chap, I hope to make
                    something good one day. I haven’t got it yet, but I’m hunting it and fighting
                    for it, I want something serious, something fresh — something with soul in it!
                    Onward, onward. You’ll see clearly enough from what I’ve said above that I’m
                    more eager to put together a serious work for reproduction than to have the
                    satisfaction of seeing one drawing printed some day. But any information and
                    tips as to processes are very welcome.</p>
                <p>In the window at G&amp;Cie I saw a large etching by Fortuny, An anchorite, as
                    well as his two beautiful The dead Kabyle and Watching over the dead man — then
                    I deeply regretted saying to you not long ago that I didn’t find Fortuny
                    beautiful – this I found extremely beautiful. Well, you’ll understand that
                    yourself. It’s the same with Boldini too. But that seriousness that Fortuny had,
                    for instance, in those three etchings is just what’s missing with many of his
                    followers, who completely follow in his wake with a manner for which F. set the
                    example in, say, ‘The choice of a model’ &amp;c. And that is the direct opposite
                    of the sombre, noble quality of Brion, of Degroux, Israëls &amp;c. When you can,
                    do send me an issue of the current Vie Moderne, look for one with reproductions
                    like the ones you wrote about. The magazine is nowhere to be found here (and
                    what I have ((a few issues)) is years old). I’ll show you more when you come,
                    sooner or later — and then we can talk about the future.</p>
                <p>You know well enough how little suited I am to approaching either dealers or art
                    lovers, and moreover how it goes against the grain for me. I so dearly wish that
                    we could always carry on as in the past, <stress reason="friendship">but I’m
                        often so sad about having to trouble you again and again.</stress> But who
                    knows whether in time it mightn’t be possible for you to interest someone or
                    other who could take the load off your shoulders that you’ve borne in the most
                    difficult time. That could be done when it’s clearly evident that my work is
                    serious, at which time it will have more appeal than this. I’m too fond of my
                    very simple life to want to change it, but later on we’ll have to incur greater
                    expenses to do greater things.</p>
                <p>I believe I’ll always work with a model a lot — always and always. And I must get
                    things to the point where not everything rests on your shoulders. This is only a
                    beginning — later you’ll get fine things from me, old chap! For the time being,
                    let me know whether you think some of the objections to using pencil alone could
                    be removed somewhat by using crayon as well. Don’t you also agree that by making
                    these drawings I may also indirectly learn things about lithography proper? </p>

                <date>Friday, 26 or Saturday, 27 January 1883.</date>
            </head>
            <salutation>My dear Theo.</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>The more I reflect upon it, the deeper the impression made on me by your last
                    letter. In broad outline (leaving aside the difference between the two people in
                    question), on a cold, merciless pavement a sombre, sorrowful figure of a woman
                    appeared before you and before me, and neither you nor I passed her by, but both
                    of us stopped and followed the promptings of our human heart. Such an encounter
                    has something of an apparition about it, at least if one thinks back one sees a
                    pale face, a sorrowful look like an Ecce Homo against a dark background;
                    everything else disappears. That is the sentiment of an Ecce Homo and in
                    reality; the same thing is in the expression, but here it’s a woman’s face.
                    Later — things are definitely different — but one doesn’t forget that first
                    moment.</p>
                <p>Below an English figure of a woman (by Paterson) is the name Dolorosa, which
                    pretty well expresses it. I’m thinking of the two women now, and at the same
                    time I thought of a drawing by Pinwell, The sisters, in which I find that
                    ‘Dolorosa’. That drawing shows two women in black in a dark room. One has just
                    come home and is hanging her coat on the hatstand. The other briefly smells a
                    primrose on the table while picking up a white piece of needlework. That Pinwell
                    is reminiscent of Feyen-Perrin — in his earlier period — his work also recalls
                    Thijs Maris, but with a yet purer feeling. He was a poet, as strong as could be,
                    he saw the sublime in the most ordinary, everyday things. His work is rare, I
                    saw little by him, but that little was so beautiful that now, 10 years later, it
                    has remained just as clear in my mind as when I first became acquainted with it.
                    At that time it was said of that group of draughtsmen ‘It’s too good to last’.
                    You can see from Herkomer’s words that sadly this has proved to be right, but it
                    isn’t dead yet, and in both literature and art it will be difficult to find a
                    better attitude than the one from those days.</p>
                <p>I often felt low in England for various reasons but those, the Black and White
                    and Dickens, are things that make up for it all. I think your meeting with this
                    woman is likely to take your thoughts back many times to the period 10 or even
                    20 years ago, or still further back. In short, I mean you will rediscover
                    yourself in her, a part of your life that you had almost forgotten, namely the
                    past, and I don’t know whether, when you’ve been with her for a year, you’ll see
                    the present through the same eyes as, for instance, before you knew her. I speak
                    from my own experience, not that I reject everything to do with the present day,
                    far from it, but still it seems to me that something from the past that was good
                    and should have been kept is going, in art particularly, but also in life
                    itself. Perhaps I’m expressing things too vaguely, but I can’t put it another
                    way — I don’t know myself what it is exactly, but it wasn’t only the Black and
                    White that changed direction and strayed from the healthy, noble beginnings.
                    Rather, in general a kind of scepticism and indifference and coldness prevails,
                    despite all the activity. But all this is too vague and ill-defined. I don’t
                    think about it all that much in fact, because I’m thinking about my drawings and
                    have no time to go into it.</p>
                <p>Still busy with heads this week, women’s heads mainly — with bags, among other
                    things. Have you ever seen anything by Boyd Houghton? He is one from the
                    beginning of The Graphic who, though little known (he’s now dead), occupies a
                    place of his own. I thought of him when you wrote about the Barricade by
                    Daumier. At the time he also did the pétroleuses and barricades in Paris. But
                    later on he went to America and I know, among other things, drawings of Shakers
                    by him, and a Mormon church, and Indian women &amp;c., and emigrants.In a
                    barricade scene, for example, he can have something ghostly, or rather something
                    mysterious like Goya. He also treated the American subjects in that way, namely
                    Goya-like, but then sometimes all at once something runs underneath that recalls
                    Meryon because of its extraordinary austerity. His woodcuts could almost pass
                    for etchings. Too good to last, they say, but it’s precisely because of that,
                    because it’s rare, that the good lasts. It isn’t produced every day — it will
                    never be obtained mechanically, but what there is of it is there, and that won’t
                    go away but remain. And even if later another kind of good comes, the first will
                    still keep its value. So in my opinion one shouldn’t lament the fact that this
                    or that hasn’t become general; even if it doesn’t become general, whatever there
                    is of the good or beautiful still exists. </p>
                <p>What’s the position these days with the etchings Cadart began years ago? Has that
                    also proved to be Too good to last? I know well enough that many etchings, and
                    beautiful ones at that, are published these days too. But I mean the old series
                    Société des Aquafortistes that included The two brothers by Feyen-Perrin and the
                    Sheep pasture by Daubigny and the Bracquemonds and so many others — have they
                    retained their power or have they gone weak? Even if they are weaker, what there
                    is — doesn’t that already have enough substance to remain for ever, thus rather
                    disproving the words too good to last? What the etching needle could do was
                    shown by Daubigny, Millet, Feyen-Perrin, and many others, just as The Graphic
                    &amp;c. showed what the Black and White could do. And this stands as a truth
                    once and for all, and those who wish can always draw energy from it. The pity of
                    it is partly that when several people care for the same cause and work on it
                    together, unity is strength, and united they can do more than their separate
                    energies can, each striving in a different direction.</p>
                <p>People strengthen each other when they work together, and an entity is formed
                    without personality having to be blotted out by the collaboration. This is why I
                    wish Rappard was fully recovered. We don’t actually work together, but we have
                    similar ideas about many questions. He’s getting better and we’re again dealing
                    in woodcuts together. <unstress reason="friendship">Yet I always have hopes that
                        we’ll become even better friends than up to now, and perhaps later visit the
                        miners together or something like that.</unstress> But for the time being I
                    believe that both he and I must do our best at thorough study of the figure; the
                    more one has mastered that the more attainable such plans become. He says he’s
                    had a fever, nothing more, and is still weak, but he’s tight-lipped about his
                    illness.</p>
                <p>We’ve had snow here again that’s now melting. The thaw is very beautiful. I
                    imagine that this spring could be unusually delightful for you. Write soon about
                    how your patient is getting on. <unstress reason="environment">Well, I’ll enjoy
                        the spring too. Today, while the snow melts, one feels the spring in the
                        distance, so to speak.</unstress> I think that we’ll have a real day when
                    you come, sooner or later. Perhaps you’ll agree with me that in times of worry,
                    such as you will certainly have now because of her illness, one can best feel
                    the poetry of things. I long for the spring so that I can get a breath of fresh
                    air instead of working at home, which has made me a little dull. I’m still very
                    happy with my sou’wester.</p>
                <p>I’m curious to know whether you’ll find anything good in the heads of fishermen.
                    The last one I did this week was of a chap with a white fringe of beard. I know
                    of one drawing by Boyd Houghton which he calls ‘my models’ and which shows a
                    corridor where several invalids — one on crutches, one blind, one a street
                    urchin &amp;c. — come to visit a painter on Christmas Day. There’s something
                    nice about dealing with models — one learns a lot from them — <unstress
                        reason="friendship">this winter I’ve had people who will always stay in my
                        memory.</unstress> I like Edouard Frère’s remark that he had hung on to his
                    models so that ‘those who used to pose as babies now pose as mothers’. </p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>My sincere congratulations to you too on Pa’s birthday, and thank you for your
                    letter, which I received just now <unstress reason="family">and am delighted
                        by.</unstress> I congratulate you especially on the operation being behind
                    you. Things such as you describe make one shudder. May it now be overcome — and
                    at least the crisis over. Poor woman! If women sometimes don’t have the same
                    energy and resilience in their thinking as men who have striven to think things
                    through and analyze them — are they to be blamed for that? I believe not,
                    because in general they must devote so much more strength than we to suffering
                    pain. They suffer more and are more sensitive. And even if they sometimes don’t
                    understand what one is thinking, they’re sometimes quite capable of
                    understanding whether one is good for them. Not in every respect perhaps, but
                    ‘the spirit is willing’ and there’s a sort of goodness in women at times that is
                    entirely peculiar to them. It must be a weight off your mind that the operation
                    has been done. What a riddle life is, and love is a riddle within a riddle.
                    Staying the same is the only thing that it certainly doesn’t do in a literal
                    sense, but on the other hand the changes are a kind of ebb and flow and make no
                    difference to the sea itself.</p>
                <p>I’ve rested my eyes a little since I last wrote to you and felt better for it,
                    although they still sting. Do you know what I couldn’t help thinking? — that in
                    the first part of life as a painter one sometimes unintentionally makes things
                    difficult for oneself — through a feeling of not yet having mastered the
                    business — through the uncertainty one feels about whether one will master it —
                    through the fierce desire to make progress — through not yet trusting oneself —
                    one cannot put aside a certain feeling of being harried, and one harries oneself
                    despite not wanting to be harried when one works. There’s nothing to be done
                    about it, and this is a time that one also can’t do without, and that should not
                    and cannot be otherwise, in my view. <stress reason="career">In the studies,
                        too, one sees for oneself the agitation and a certain precision that’s
                        diametrically opposed to the calm breadth one seeks</stress> — and yet one
                    feels bad if one works specifically for that breadth and devotes oneself to
                    that. As a result there’s sometimes a bottling up of nervous restlessness and
                    stress, and one feels an oppressiveness as on some summer days before a
                    storm.</p>
                <p>I’ve just had that again, and when I feel like that I change to different work,
                    precisely in order to start from scratch. The difficulties one faces in the
                    first phase give the studies a painful quality at times. I don’t regard this as
                    something that discourages me, though, because I’ve noticed it in others as much
                    as in myself, and in them it has increasingly gone away of its own accord. And
                    work remains difficult at times throughout one’s life, I believe, but not always
                    with so few results as in the beginning. What you write about Lhermitte is
                    entirely in accord with what it said in a review of an exhibition of Black and
                    White. That also talks about a rude assault that is almost impossible to compare
                    with anything else except Rembrandt. I’d like to know how someone like that sees
                    Judas — you write about a drawing of Judas before the scribes by him. I believe
                    Victor Hugo could describe that in detail so that one saw it. But it would be
                    even more difficult to paint the expressions. I’ve found a Daumier print, Those
                    who have seen a tragedy and those who have seen a vaudeville. I begin to long
                    for Daumier more and more as time passes. There’s something pithy and
                    ‘considered’ in him. He’s amusing and yet full of emotion and passion.
                    Sometimes, it seems to me I find a passion that might be likened to white-hot
                    iron, in the drunkards, for instance, and probably in the Barricade too (which I
                    don’t know). That’s also in some heads by Frans Hals, for example. It’s so
                    subdued that it seems cold, and when one takes a look at it — — — one is amazed
                    that someone evidently working with so much emotion and becoming completely
                    absorbed and lost in nature at the same time has that presence of mind to set it
                    down with such a steady hand.</p>
                <p>I found something similar in studies and drawings by Degroux. Perhaps Lhermitte
                    is another white-hot one. And Menzel too. There are sometimes passages in Balzac
                    and Zola – in Père Goriot, for example – in which one finds a degree of passion
                    in words that’s white-hot. I sometimes think about experimenting with a
                    completely different way of working, namely daring and risking more. But I don’t
                    know whether I ought not to study the figure more directly, definitely with a
                    model. I’m also looking for a way of shutting out the light in the studio or
                    letting it in as desired. At present not enough comes from above, I believe, and
                    there’s too much. I’ve sometimes closed it off with cardboard temporarily, but
                    I’ll see if I can get shutters from the landlord.</p>
                <p>What was in the letter I told you I had torn up was in the spirit of what you
                    say. But as one realizes more and more that one isn’t perfect and has
                    shortcomings, and that others do too, and thus there are continual difficulties
                    that are the opposite of illusions, so I believe that those who don’t lose heart
                    and don’t become apathetic as a result mature through it, and one must endure in
                    order to mature. Sometimes I can’t understand all the same that I’m only 30 and
                    feel so much older. I feel older especially when I <stress reason="environment"
                        >think that most of the people who know me regard me as a failure</stress>,
                    and I believe that if a few things don’t change for the better this really could
                    be the case, and when I think, it could turn out like that, then I feel that
                    with such reality that <bad_health>I’m totally oppressed by it and I lose all
                        enjoyment</bad_health>, as if it were really so. When I’m in a more normal
                    and calm mood, I’m sometimes glad that 30 years are past and haven’t gone by
                    without my learning something in them for the future, and I feel strength and
                    zest for the next 30 — if I last that long. And in my imagination I see years of
                    serious work, and happier ones than the first 30. How it will turn out in
                    reality doesn’t depend on me alone — the world and circumstances must also
                    cooperate. What concerns me, and what I’m responsible for, is that I make the
                    most of the circumstances I’m in, and do my best to make progress.</p>
                <p>As a working man, at the age of 30 one is at the beginning of a period in which
                    one feels steadiness in oneself. As such, one feels young and full of zest. Yet
                    at the same time a period of life is over, which makes one sad that this or that
                    will never come back. And it isn’t weak sentimentality to feel a certain sorrow
                    now and then. Anyway, much only begins when one is 30, and it’s certain that not
                    everything is over by then. But one doesn’t expect from life what one already
                    knows from experience that it cannot give. Rather, one begins to see much more
                    clearly that life is only a time of fertilization and that the harvest is not
                    here. This is why one sometimes thinks, what do I care about the world’s
                    judgement?, and if that judgement is too much of a burden, one can shrug it off.
                    Perhaps now I ought to tear up this letter as well. I can understand that you’re
                    very much preoccupied with the woman’s condition, and that’s one of the things
                    needed to save her and to ensure that she makes a good recovery. For one must
                    throw oneself into it, and the saying applies, If you want it well done you must
                    do it yourself, you mustn’t leave it to others. That is to say, one must keep
                    hold of the general care and overseeing of the whole.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="environment">We’ve had a couple of true spring days, including
                        last Monday, which I enjoyed.</unstress> The change of the seasons is
                    something the people feel very much. For example, in a neighbourhood like the
                    Geest district and in the almshouses or so-called ‘gift houses’ winter is always
                    an anxious and difficult and frightening time, and spring a deliverance. If one
                    looks closely, one sees that there’s a kind of gospel on the first day of
                    spring. And on such a day it’s heart-rending to see so many grey, withered faces
                    expressly coming out of doors, not to do anything in particular but as if to
                    convince themselves that spring has come. So, for example, sometimes all kinds
                    of people in whom one wouldn’t expect it crowd round a spot on the market where
                    a trader is selling crocuses, snowdrops, goatsbeard and other bulbs. Sometimes a
                    parchment ministry official, a sort of Josserand evidently, in a threadbare
                    black coat with a felt collar — I find him beside the snowdrops beautiful. I
                    believe that the poor and the painters have the sentiment of the weather and the
                    changing seasons in common. Of course everyone feels that, but for the
                    better-off they’re hardly events at all, and don’t generally make much
                    difference to their state of mind. I like this remark by a polder worker: ‘In
                    the winter I suffer as much cold as the winter corn’.</p>
                <p>Now, your patient will certainly welcome the spring too. May she do well. What a
                    difficult operation that is, at least I was shocked when I read the description.
                    Rappard is getting better — did I write to you that he’d had a nervous fever of
                    the brain? It will be some time before he can work as before, but he has started
                    going for walks now and then. I’ll follow your advice to bathe my eyes with tea
                    if it doesn’t go away. It’s lessening, so for the present I’ll let things take
                    their natural course. Because I was never troubled by it in the past, except
                    this winter along with toothache, and so I believe it to be something accidental
                    caused by my unusual exertions. And now I can bear the tired eyes when drawing
                    better than in the beginning. </p>

                <p>I don’t know if you know the ‘gift houses’ on Brouwersgracht opposite the

                    few scratches there this week. They’re some rows of houses with small gardens
                    which belong to the poor board, I believe.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>I wanted to write to you on Sunday but I waited because I was busy with something
                    that hadn’t yet been decided. A week or so ago I was reading Fritz Reuter’s ‘Uit
                    mijn gevangenistijd’, in which he describes very amusingly how Fritz R. and
                    others serving fortress sentences made life as agreeable as possible and secured
                    various privileges from their ‘field officer’. That book gave me the idea of
                    tackling my landlord with a view to certain improvements that would make my work
                    easier. And I’ve been back and forth to Voorburg, where he lives, several times
                    to get him to do one thing and another. There were some old wooden blinds and
                    planks lying there that I wanted to use, but it wasn’t easy to get them. Still,
                    I have them now.</p>
                <p>As you know, there are 3 windows in the studio. They give much too much light,
                    even if I cover them, and I’ve long been thinking about how to remedy this. But
                    he didn’t want to do anything unless I paid him. But now, as the result of
                    tackling him again, I have 6 blinds and about 6 long planks. Those blinds are
                    now being sawn to make shutters that can be manoeuvred so that more or less
                    light is shut out or let in as required, from above or below. From this scratch
                    I think you’ll see that it works very nicely. And the planks are for a big
                    cupboard in the alcove, for storing drawings, prints, books, and as a hatstand
                    for various smocks, jackets, old coats, shawls and hats, not forgetting the
                    sou’wester, which I need for the models. I’ve paid the landlord regularly and
                    have now told him straight out that I wouldn’t contradict him if he thought the
                    rent for the house was low, but I asked him to consider that <stress
                        reason="money">for me the rent was still a heavy burden.</stress> And that I
                    could not work readily or make progress until I had better light. That if he
                    couldn’t change it I, for my part, really would be forced to find another
                    studio. That if I could afford it I would put up with paying for it, but now I
                    wasn’t in a position to pay more than I was already. So my paying more was out
                    of the question, and whether I stayed depended on whether or not he would have
                    this done. If my leaving was a matter of indifference to him, we’d part as good
                    friends and say no more. Well, then he said, no, he did want to do something,
                    and so we finally agreed that I need only pay a few guilders’ worth of labour.
                    He’s been to the studio himself repeatedly and is certainly not a swindler,
                    though he has a pretty sharp tongue (a bit like a Yankee). And it seems that the
                    studio was better than he’d expected (he hadn’t seen it since July last year);
                    at any rate I got it approved while in the studio, and more easily even than I
                    expected. If only one could always deal with people in the studio! But outside
                    it I, for one, can’t get them to do much and can’t get on well with them.</p>
                <p>Have been working on some figures, rather large, busts or to the knees, which
                    will be a sort of decoration for the corridor and stairs, together with a few
                    others, though they’re really no more than ordinary studies. Anyway, you see
                    from one thing and another that I’ve once again thrown myself headlong into it,
                    so that I’ll get new ideas in my head through being busy. At Voorburg, for
                    example, when I went with him to sort out that wood, I saw beautiful scenes of
                    labourers in a shed and the excavation of a cellar and the laying of the
                    foundations of a house. I thought of what you once wrote to me about the
                    labourers in Montmartre when you were there, when one of them injured himself in
                    a stone quarry. As you know, I already had something in front of the windows,
                    namely canvas stretched on laths. They’re no longer needed now, but will be
                    highly desirable as backgrounds, with darker or lighter material stretched over
                    them, when one wants to draw heads, for example. You see now that I’ll be able
                    to cover over one or two windows completely and thus obtain one general light
                    that will make the effects much stronger. Otherwise they’d be neutralized by
                    reflections or different lights. The job would have been entirely out of the
                    question if I’d had to pay for it myself, since it was expensive, and I’m very
                    pleased with it. I felt that better light was desirable, especially when doing
                    drawings like those I was working on of late, such as those heads I sent you in
                    which I used a stronger black. I hope everything will work properly but you can
                    see for yourself from this scratch that it’s so simple that it’s bound to work,
                    it seems to me.</p>
                <p>Yet how miserable today’s houses often are compared with what they could be if
                    people made an effort to furnish them pleasantly. Compare a modern window with
                    one from Rembrandt’s time. In those days everyone seems to have had a sort of
                    need for a curious, dimmed light that no longer seems to exist, at least there’s
                    a tendency to make it cold, harsh and loveless. A good start was made with
                    workers’ dwellings, but I see no sign of advances being made since those of 20
                    or 30 years ago. On the contrary, the pleasing aspect is increasingly lost, and
                    it turns into something cold and systematic and methodical that becomes ever
                    more empty with time. If I could have, I would have had the windows altered like
                    this: which wouldn’t have been that much more if we hadn’t been dealing with
                    blinds that already existed. The difference is only that there’s a frame around
                    each square of light, and the blinds are thus slightly smaller. But the latter
                    is an agreeable and easily achieved, pleasing window. But one can’t have
                    everything. And it ought really to have a broad window-sill — where one could
                    sit — which is entirely lacking in this house.</p>
                <p>I’m longing for your letter and news of your patient. May she have remained calm
                    and may the recovery be normal and successful. But it doesn’t always go smoothly
                    and rapidly, and something or other almost always comes up, and at all events
                    one must be very much on the alert. Just last week I read Notre-Dame by Hugo,
                    which I had read before over 10 years ago. Do you know who I recognized in it,
                    or at least was so convinced I recognized that I don’t doubt that Victor Hugo
                    intended some such thing? I recognized Thijs Maris in Quasimodo. Most people who
                    read N. Dame probably have an impression of Quasimodo as a sort of clown. But
                    you wouldn’t think Quasimodo ridiculous any more than I would, and like me you
                    would feel that what Hugo says is true. For those who know that Quasimodo
                    existed, now Notre-Dame is empty. For not only was he its inhabitant, but he was
                    its soul. If one takes Notre-Dame as a symbol of the movement in art that found
                    expression in, for instance, Leys and Degroux (sometimes) and Lagye and De
                    Vriendt, Henri Pille, the following can be applied to Thijs Maris: now there’s
                    an emptiness for those who know that he existed, for he was its soul, and the
                    soul of that art, it was he.</p>
                <p>Anyway, Thijs Maris still exists but not in his full prime and vigour — not
                    unhurt and disenchanted to the extent that there can be disenchantment with him.
                    One of the enormities committed by the painters here is, I believe, that even
                    now they still laugh at Thijs Maris. I think there’s something as dismal as
                    suicide in that. Why suicide? Because Thijs Maris is such an embodiment of
                    something high and noble that in my view a painter can’t mock that without
                    lowering himself. Those who don’t understand Maris, so much the worse for them,
                    those who do understand him grieve for him, and grieve that such a person has
                    snapped. Noble blade, ignoble scabbard — In my soul I am fair. This is
                    applicable to Thijs M. and to Quasimodo.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Thanks for your letter of 9 March and for the enclosure. Is your patient making
                    good progress? I hope that no news about her is good news. If it was as cold in
                    your part of the world as it was here last week, she wouldn’t have been best
                    pleased. While for your part you say you sometimes long for us to be able to
                    talk rather more about various things in art, for my part I feel that longing
                    constantly, and on occasion very strongly. I would so often dearly like to know
                    your opinion about this or that — about some studies &amp;c., for example
                    whether they might be made into something suitable, or whether it was advisable
                    to press on with something for one purpose or another. I would like so often to
                    have more information about matters which you certainly know more about than I
                    do, and would dearly like to hear more about what’s going on, namely what sorts
                    of thing are being made. This can all be dealt with in part by letter, but
                    writing takes time and one doesn’t get round to it easily, nor can one go into
                    things in sufficient detail. And now in particular — because studies are piling
                    up, rather — I’d give a great deal for us to be able to speak to each other
                    again, and I also long for you to see how much more suitable the studio now
                    is.</p>
                <p>Anyway, we’ll hope that it won’t be so very, very long before you come to
                    Holland. Rest assured, dear brother, that the sense of the enormous obligation I
                    have to you for your loyal help is always fresh and vivid inside me. It would be
                    difficult for me to express all my many thoughts about that. <stress
                        reason="career">It remains the cause of a kind of disappointment to me that
                        I don’t yet see in my drawings what I wanted to have in them.</stress> The
                    difficulties really are many and great, and not to be overcome at a stroke.
                    Making headway is a kind of miner’s labour that doesn’t go as quickly as one
                    would wish and as others expect. But if one is faced by such labour, the first
                    things one must hang on to are patience and faith. In fact I don’t think much
                    about the difficulties, precisely because if one were to fret about them one
                    would get dizzy or become confused. A weaver who must control and interweave
                    many threads has no time to philosophize about how they fit together, but rather
                    he’s so absorbed in his work that he doesn’t think but acts, and feels how it
                    can and must work out rather than being able to explain it. Even if neither you
                    nor I come up with particular plans etc. when we can speak to each other again,
                    this feeling that something is coming into being may strengthen on both sides.
                    And I would want that.</p>
                <p>This morning I was with Van der Weele, who was working on a very beautiful
                    painting of diggers, horses and sand-carts. Big. It was beautiful in tone and
                    colour — a grey morning mist — it was manly in drawing and composition, it had
                    style and character — in short, it was by far the most beautiful and most
                    vigorous work of his I’ve ever seen. He had painted three very beautiful,
                    thorough studies, as well as an old white horse and a fine small landscape in
                    the dunes too. This week he may come to have a look at my studio, which I would
                    like very much. I saw Breitner briefly in the street last week. His position in
                    Rotterdam is reassuring for him — but just this morning Van der Weele had had a
                    note from him to say that he was ill again. To tell you the truth, the
                    impression I got when I saw him again wasn’t very favourable; in fact I found a
                    je ne sais quoi of disappointment in him, and he talked rather oddly about his
                    work.</p>
                <p>Now I must tell you about a surprise I’ve had. I received a letter from Pa, very
                    cordial and cheerful it seemed to me, with 25 guilders in it. <unstress
                        reason="money">Pa wrote that he’d received some money he hadn’t expected and
                        that he wanted to let me share in it.</unstress>
                    <unstress reason="family">Wasn’t that awfully kind? It makes me blush,
                        though.</unstress> But there’s one thought that instinctively springs to
                    mind. Can it be, perhaps, that Pa has heard from someone or other that I’m
                    living in poverty or some such thing? I wouldn’t care for it if something like
                    that was the motive, for in my opinion this view of my circumstances wouldn’t be
                    accurate. And could cause Pa concern that isn’t entirely appropriate. You will
                    understand my intention better than Pa if I were to try to explain such a thing
                    to him. In my view I’m often very rich, not in money, but rich (although not
                    every day exactly) because I’ve found my work — have something which I live for
                    heart and soul and which gives inspiration and meaning to life. My mood varies,
                    of course, but nonetheless <good_health>I have a certain average
                        serenity.</good_health> I have a certain faith in art, a certain trust that
                    it’s a powerful current that drives a person — although he has to cooperate — to
                    a haven, and in any case I consider it such a great happiness if a person has
                    found his work that I don’t count myself among the unfortunate. I mean, even if
                    I were in certain fairly serious difficulties, and even if there were sombre
                    days in my life, I wouldn’t like it and wouldn’t consider it right if someone
                    were to count me among the unfortunate.</p>
                <p>You say something in your letter that I also feel on occasion — <stress
                        reason="environment">‘Sometimes I don’t know how I’ll get through it.’ You
                        see, I often feel that, often and in more than one respect, not only
                        financially but in art itself and life in general.</stress> Yet is that
                    unusual? Doesn’t everyone with a little enterprise and energy have such moments?
                    In my view we all have moments of melancholy, of stress, of anguish, to a
                    greater or lesser extent, and this is a condition of every self-conscious human
                    life. Some apparently have no self-consciousness. But those who have such
                    moments, although then sometimes in an anxious state, aren’t unfortunate because
                    of that, and nothing unusual is happening to them. And sometimes there’s a
                    solution, sometimes new inner energy comes and one gets up from them, until
                    perhaps finally, one fine day, one no longer gets up from them – so be it – but
                    there’s nothing unusual in this and, I repeat, it’s inherent in human life, in
                    my view. Pa’s letter was in reply to a letter of mine which I remember very well
                    was cheerful, because I told him about the changes to the studio, and I did not
                    write to Pa about anything that could give rise to the idea that I was in any
                    kind of difficulty of a financial or other nature. Indeed, Pa doesn’t write
                    anything like that, and his letter is cheerful and cordial, but it came so
                    unexpectedly that it may not be too far-fetched to suggest that I instinctively
                    got the idea: <stress reason="family">can it be that Pa’s worried about
                        me?</stress> If I’m mistaken in this, it would hardly be appropriate to
                    write as if that were the chief impression I gained from something so cordial.
                    The chief impression, in fact, being that I have a feeling of gratitude about
                    receiving something that enables me to do various things that I couldn’t have
                    done otherwise. I’m sharing my thoughts about this with you, though, partly
                    because, should you notice at some point that Pa’s worried about me, you’ll be
                    better able than I am to give Pa the reassurance I would wish him to have. You
                    will also gather from this that I’ve had a remarkable windfall. I intend to use
                    it to get everything back in order for watercolours.</p>
                <p>I’ll settle up with Leurs and do several more things to the studio to make it
                    more practical. It sometimes seems to me that the prices of the various drawing
                    and painting materials have sometimes been dreadfully inflated. To such an
                    extent that many feel they’re prevented from painting as a result. One of my
                    ideals would be to have more places like the one at The Graphic, say, where
                    people who want to work can find all the materials, on condition that they have
                    a certain evident ability and energy. Just as in the past Cadart enabled many to
                    etch who wouldn’t have been able to etch because of the costs if they’d had to
                    pay for it out of their own pocket. I’m greatly privileged compared with many
                    others, but all the same I can’t do everything that I have the heart and
                    enthusiasm to undertake. The costs are so many, beginning with the model and
                    food and accommodation, and ending with different paints and brushes. And that,
                    too, is a loom where different threads must be kept apart. Yet we all face this
                    — but precisely because anyone who paints or draws is faced with this, and is
                    nearly overwhelmed by it if alone, why don’t more painters join hands to work
                    together like soldiers forming ranks? And, above all, why are those branches of
                    art that are the least expensive so despised?</p>
                <p>Regarding the natural chalk — I don’t know whether what I got from you came from
                    the Plaats, but I’m sure that I got it from you at the time of your visit last
                    summer, or perhaps in Etten still. I found a very small remnant at a chemist’s,
                    about six pieces but all in small bits. Bear it in mind. When I asked Leurs
                    about it again he told me that Jaap Maris had often asked him for it. I’ve done
                    two more sketches with it, a cradle and one similar to one I’d already sent in
                    which I used a lot of sepia wash.As to what you write concerning that one sketch
                    about the two figures one above the other, it’s mainly an effect of the
                    perspective. But also of the big difference in size between the small child and
                    the woman on the basket. What bothers me more than that line of the composition
                    is something that you’ve also noticed, by the way — that the two figures are too
                    equal in strength. In part this is because the natural chalk lacks some tones,
                    and one would like to put in greater strengths with lithographic crayon, say.
                    But in my view the main reason is that I don’t always have the time to work as
                    elaborately as I would like. It’s possible to search for the different tones
                    more elaborately if one repeatedly comes back to a drawing. But often I have to
                    work in quite a hurry. I daren’t ask too much of my models. If I paid them more
                    elaborately I could ask for more elaborate poses, that’s to say longer and more.
                    Now I often consider that I receive more from them in effort than I give them in
                    money. Nonetheless, I believe there is moreover another, weightier reason,
                    namely that I must become much more skilled than I am if I’m to be at all
                    content with myself. And I hope that gradually I’ll work more deftly and more
                    elaborately in the same amount of time that I now devote to it.</p>
                <p>Well, brother — best wishes with your patient — I long, for instance, for another
                    of your descriptions of an aspect of Paris. And rest absolutely assured that
                    I’ll be very glad to manage as best I can with the means I have through your
                    loyal help, and that I don’t consider them inadequate for ordinary purposes
                    either, and that I think about ways of making even more and better use of them,
                    and lay the blame chiefly on myself if I can’t achieve certain things with
                    them.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>You’ve so often shown me a glimpse of Paris through your descriptions, this time
                    I’m letting you have a look out of my window at the snow-covered yard. I’m
                    adding a glimpse of a corner of the house; <work origin="new" stage="sketch"
                        >they’re two impressions of the same winter’s day.</work> Poetry surrounds
                    us everywhere, but getting it onto paper is something that unfortunately doesn’t
                    go as readily as looking. <work origin="new" stage="finished">I did a
                        watercolour of the above after which this scratch is done;</work> however, I
                    don’t think it lively or vigorous enough. I believe I’ve already written to you
                    that I found a little more natural chalk here in town. I’m also working with
                    that. In my view this has been the most real part of this winter, those cold
                    days we had last week. It was mightily beautiful with the snow — and curious
                    skies. The melting of the snow today was almost more beautiful. But it was
                    typical winter weather, if I may call it that — it was the kind of weather that
                    brings back old memories, when the most ordinary things have a look such that
                    one instinctively associates them with stories from the age of diligences and
                    mail-coaches.</p>
                <p>
                    <work origin="new" stage="sketch">Here’s a scratch, for example,</work> that I
                    did in that kind of daydream. It shows a gentleman who has had to spend the
                    night at a village inn due to the late arrival of a diligence or some such
                    reason. Now he has risen early, and while he orders a glass of brandy for the
                    cold he pays the innkeeper’s wife (a woman with a peasant’s cap). But it’s still
                    very early in the morning, ‘the crack of dawn’, — he must catch the mail-coach —
                    the moon is still shining and the glistening snow can be seen through the window
                    of the taproom — and the objects cast oddly whimsical shadows. This story is
                    really nothing at all, and the scratch is nothing too, but from one thing and
                    another you’ll perhaps understand what I mean, namely that of late everything
                    had a je ne sais quoi that made one feel like scribbling it down on paper. In
                    short, the whole of nature is an inexpressibly beautiful Black and White
                    exhibition when there are those snow effects. <work origin="new" stage="sketch"
                        >Now I’m doing scratches anyway, I’m adding a very superficial one of a
                        drawing in natural chalk, the girl at the cradle, done in the same way as
                        the woman and the child you wrote about.</work> This natural chalk really is
                    odd stuff. The other scratch of a skipper is after a drawing which has a lot of
                    washes with neutral tint and sepia. It wouldn’t surprise me in the least if the
                    little I’ve sent you recently struck you as being a rather meagre result.</p>
                <p>Indeed, I believe it could hardly be otherwise. There’s something fated about it:
                    that in order to see the singularity of the work in Black and White, one must
                    always take the whole into account, and it’s impossible to do so all the time. I
                    mean, there’s a certain difference between making 10 drawings and making 100
                    drawings or sketches or studies. Not, to be sure, because of the quantity —
                    leave the quantity aside — but what I want to say is this: in Black and White
                    there’s a certain mildness which enables one to draw one and the same figure
                    that one finds beautiful in perhaps 10 different poses, whereas with
                    watercolour, say, or if one painted it, one would do it in only one pose. Now
                    assume that in this 10 there are 9 bad ones. I sincerely hope the ratio of good
                    to bad won’t always be like this, but let’s assume for now that it is. If you
                    yourself were to be at the studio now, I don’t think a week would pass without
                    me presenting you with not one but a certain number of studies — and it would
                    amaze me if you couldn’t always pick out from that certain number one or two
                    things in which you found something attractive. While that wouldn’t mean that
                    the rest had been done for nothing, since studies that fail in some respects
                    turn out one day to have a purpose and to be of use for some new composition
                    after all. So for this reason I believe that when you come here again you’ll
                    find certain things about which you can probably give me some tips.</p>
                <p>So, for example, for me, who doesn’t have even the slightest knowledge of
                    Lhermitte’s drawings (you know I did enquire about them) and does know Cicéri’s
                    watercolours as well as his old lithographic drawing examples, but nothing at
                    all of his present drawings in black and white — so, as I say, it’s rather
                    difficult for me to understand exactly what you mean when you wrote about a
                    certain scratch: ‘Couldn’t you do something that would be somewhat on the lines
                    of the drawings mentioned?’ I’m sure that both those artists are infinitely more
                    advanced than I am — but still, that idea of yours might be feasible — I believe
                    I’ll learn things myself, won’t I? And it won’t be an impossibility. And I
                    wanted to say this to you again — in my view the position is that once I’ve
                    managed to make something suitable for that purpose, there’s a certain mildness
                    in Black and White that would enable someone to be highly productive in that
                    direction once found. Not without continuous labour, of course, but I face that
                    now anyway. <work origin="existing" stage="finished">So should it be that the
                        drawings in natural chalk I sent you aren’t what you intended,</work> even
                    though I had your tip in mind when I did them, don’t let that discourage you,
                    and feel at liberty to come back to that point, the more often the better. And
                    be assured that once I’ve grasped your intention I’ll be prepared, for example,
                    to do as I said above — and do 10 of them to get one good one.</p>
                <p>Anyway, when you come to the studio sometime, I believe you’ll see that I have a
                    certain level of activity, and I hope you’ll continue to see me in that way,
                    won’t you?, and that you also understand that, although someone with a certain
                    level of activity, even if it’s for himself — or rather without his work having
                    an immediate destination — is nonetheless working, it would be doubly
                    encouraging if one could find a destination. This also applies to possible work
                    for illustrated magazines. These past few days I’ve been re-reading ‘Gedroogde
                    kruiden’ by Fritz Reuter with enormous pleasure. It’s just like Knaus or
                    Vautier, say. Do you know a draughtsman called Régamey? His work has great
                    character, I have woodcuts by him, among them drawings done in prison — and
                    Gypsies and Japanese. When you come you must see my woodcuts again. I’ve got
                    some new ones since last time. It seemed to you perhaps as if the sun shone
                    brighter and everything had acquired a new charm.</p>
                <p>At any rate, I believe this is always the effect of a serious love, and that’s a
                    delightful thing. And I believe those who say that one doesn’t think clearly
                    then are mistaken, for it’s then that one thinks very clearly and does more than
                    otherwise. And love is something eternal, it changes its aspect but not its
                    foundation. And there’s the same difference between someone who loves and the
                    same man before as between a lamp that is lit and one that isn’t. The lamp was
                    there and was a good lamp, but now it gives light as well and has its proper
                    function. And one becomes calmer regarding many things, and precisely because of
                    that one is more fit for one’s work. I can find no words for how beautiful the
                    old courtyards are here. And although Israëls does it perfectly, so to speak, I
                    find it strange that so relatively few pay them any attention. Here in The Hague
                    every day, so to speak, I see a world which a great many pass by and which is
                    very different from what most are making. And wouldn’t dare say this if I hadn’t
                    had the experience of figure painters actually passing it by as well, and
                    remembered walking with them and, when I was struck by this or that figure we
                    encountered, hearing repeatedly ‘Oh, but those filthy folk’ or ‘that sort of
                    people’ — in short, expressions one wouldn’t expect from a painter. Yes, that
                    sometimes made me stop and think. I remember, among others, a conversation with
                    Henkes, who often saw and sees so well, which absolutely astonished me. It’s
                    just as if they deliberately avoid the most serious, the most beautiful, in
                    short, voluntarily muzzle themselves and clip their wings. And while I gradually
                    gain more respect for some, with others I can’t help thinking that they’ll lapse
                    into sterility if they carry on in the same way. And the old Bohème was very
                    strong on exactly that point, that it was productive. And — and some say la
                    Bohème is no good, but be careful, there are some who want to grab every last
                    bit in the barrel and — and — and will get the lid on their nose. Put out the
                    candle — so be it — but it will bring no good to snuff it out prematurely.</p>

                <date>on or about Wednesday, 11 April 1883.</date>
            </head>
            <salutation>Dear brother,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Thank you for your letter and the 50 francs enclosed, which were very welcome as
                    always, both the former and the latter. I read what you write about your patient
                    with interest. I understand that you’re in two minds over the matter of posing a
                    certain question — which I shan’t further define here — now or later. And the
                    change of circumstances brought about by her recovery has a more or less
                    critical side because, and this is what you are actually prepared for (and say
                    so yourself), opposition may be aroused — possibly anyway — let’s hope not. How
                    odd that last point really is. One sees what one does as simple and natural in
                    itself — something self-evident — one is more or less puzzled as to why others
                    don’t find the motives in themselves that compel someone to do such a thing. And
                    would almost draw the conclusion that some people have cauterized certain
                    sensory nerves in themselves — in particular those collectively known as the
                    conscience. Anyway, I pity such people: in my view they travel through life
                    without a compass. Love of one’s fellow man is something one would expect to be
                    able to take for granted in everyone as the basis of just about everything. But
                    some believe there are better foundations. I feel little curiosity about
                    them.</p>
                <p>This old foundation that has been tested and found good for so many centuries is
                    enough for me. Don’t you find this nicely put? — it’s from Les misérables: If
                    Caesar had given me Glory and war, And if I was forced to forgo My mother’s
                    love, To great Caesar would I say, Take back your sceptre and your chariot, I
                    love my mother more, hey!, I love my mother more. In the context in which this
                    (a student song from the time of the revolution of ’30) occurs, love of my
                    mother stands for love of the Republic, or rather ‘love of mankind’; in other
                    words, quite simply, universal brotherhood. A woman, however good and noble she
                    may be by nature, in my view stands in great and immediate danger in today’s
                    society of sinking into the maelstrom of prostitution if she has no means and
                    isn’t protected by her own family. What is more natural than that one should
                    support such a person? And if there’s no other solution when circumstances lead
                    to it, well, then — you must put your heart and soul into it and marry her. At
                    least it seems to me that one must make it a principle to continue with this
                    protection once offered until rescue is complete, and to protect with one’s own
                    breast if necessary. Even without a particular love? Perhaps, yes — in that case
                    it’s a marriage of convenience, so be it — but not in the sense of a marriage
                    that one enters into for gain.</p>
                <p>And now, your particular case differs from the more everyday — such as mine, for
                    instance — because of the singular circumstance that the person in question has
                    a special charm and that there is, I believe, a sympathy of feeling, so that
                    even if the meeting had taken place under entirely different and less dramatic
                    circumstances, you might have been in two minds over the question at issue. In
                    the above you have my thoughts on the question: ‘How far may one go in becoming
                    involved with an unfortunate woman?’ Answer — ‘ad infinitum’. While still
                    emphasizing that staying loyal comes first and foremost in all love, I remind
                    you of your own words that ‘marrying’ (i.e. civil marriage) ‘is such an odd
                    thing’. These words of yours express exactly how it is, and on that point I
                    declare I don’t know which is better or worse, to meddle or not. It’s what they
                    call ‘puzzling’. It puzzles me too — and I for my part wish so much that one had
                    nothing to do with that. I believe it’s well said that ‘when one marries, one
                    marries not only the woman herself but the family too’, which is sometimes more
                    or less fatal and wretched if they’re nasty people.</p>
                <p>But now about the drawings — I’ve done some more with printer’s ink, and this
                    week I was investigating how to mix the printer’s ink with white, and found that
                    it can be mixed in at least two ways — namely with the white from the tubes of
                    oil paint — and probably even better with the ordinary zinc white in powder form
                    that one can even get at any chemist — in that case diluting it with turpentine,
                    which doesn’t soak through on this paper or leave marks on the reverse like oil
                    — because it dries so quickly and disappears. Printer’s ink has much livelier
                    effects than indian ink. How beautiful Jules Dupré’s work is. In the window at
                    G&amp;C. I saw a small seascape which you no doubt know, and which I’ve been
                    going to have a look at almost every evening — but as regards Dupré and similar
                    art — of which one sees so much more in Paris than here — you may be rather
                    spoiled — and not know what an almightily beautiful impression it makes here,
                    where one sees so precious little of it.</p>
                <p>Have got round to reading the last part of Les misérables — the figure of Fantine
                    — a prostitute — made a deep impression on me — oh, I know as well as anyone
                    that in reality one won’t find an exact Fantine — but all the same this
                    character by Hugo — like all his characters for that matter — is true, being the
                    essence of what one sees in reality. It is the type — of which one encounters
                    only individuals. Should you happen to run into an engraver one of these days,
                    like Girardet or Eichens, for example, who make aquatints, you’d be doing me a
                    great favour if you could ask in passing: what is normally used for the drawings
                    intended to serve as a guide for the engraving? Perhaps they’ll say: printer’s
                    ink. If that’s what they use, what do they dilute that printer’s ink with? How
                    do they use it? It seems to me that if you raised this with some engraver or
                    other in passing and told me what he said, I would probably find something in
                    what he said that would throw light on some questions, even if it wasn’t a
                    direct answer to what printer’s ink is mixed with to make it possible to work
                    with it on paper in various ways. No doubt there are other kinds of printer’s
                    ink apart from the one I have at the moment, and the question may resolve itself
                    in due course. Effects like those in aquatint engravings are produced in the
                    drawings when one works with printer’s ink and turpentine, as I tried now. I’ve
                    seen drawings in the past by Mottram, say, the English engraver who engraved the
                    Boughtons, and I wish I knew what he worked with, for example. It goes without
                    saying that I’m not in a rush to have this information, but if you happen to
                    hear something about different methods of drawing, do let me know. </p>
                <p>I too know Soek’s wife and her mother (if she still lives with her) — went there
                    in the past — they’re still very clear in my memory — and find them two
                    sympathetic people — who remind me of the members of my own household — so much
                    so indeed that instinctively I often think of them as members of the same
                    family. They’re just like characters from Souvestre, say, or E. Frère. One sees
                    more people like that in Paris — everywhere for that matter. Such people always
                    remind me of the female figures in the gospel, perhaps because sometimes in
                    their expressions there’s something of, for instance, the figures in Delaroche,
                    Good Friday, or in Landelle, Blessed are they that mourn. I know, this view
                    isn’t complete, there are other aspects — still better than Delaroche — and
                    deeper than he — such as those of Lhermitte and Herkomer. Well, I find that in
                    them too, but I can still understand that this movement became popular in the
                    days of Souvestre, Delaroche, Frère, Landelle &amp;c., even though compared with
                    Millet and others it isn’t entirely correct and true. Is ANKER still alive? I
                    think of his work often, I find it so sound and so delicately felt. He’s one of
                    the genuine old sort, like Brion. Old chap, how I sometimes long for you to be
                    in the studio again. I sincerely hope you’ll get the money back from H. In my
                    case a lot had to be spent right away this time, <stress reason="money">and I
                        have precious little left.</stress> Anyway, write as soon as you can when

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>I received your letter in good order with the 50 francs enclosed. Which were a
                    deliverance for me, at any rate a respite. I’ve also heard from friend Rappard —
                    but nothing definite as yet. A letter that’s a reply to my letter, and that he
                    will help me and come as well, but, he writes, my health is letting me down
                    again. Ends with: I enclose the money herewith. Postscriptum: oh, I’ll come
                    immediately and bring it myself — I’ll come tomorrow. This is followed by a
                    telegram the next day. Not coming, letter follows later. <stress reason="money"
                        >So, despite having heard something, it’s still the same as with a game of
                        goose,</stress> if you remember how one can land on a goose, thus go
                    forward, but unfortunately just then land on a new goose with its beak pointing
                    in a direction one doesn’t want to take, and so one must count back to one’s
                    original position. Yet it isn’t his fault, for he’s been really very ill and is
                    still feeling the remnants or after-effects of that. Moreover, his sister had a
                    fairly similar illness, and they were most concerned about her, but she
                    recovered too. Nonetheless, I do believe this of friend Rappard, that he does
                    things that cost him a great deal of energy and nervous tension and aren’t worth
                    the powder he expends on them. Thus before his illness I heard about decorations
                    for the centenary of the Utrecht painters’ society, and now this time it was
                    church ornaments. By chance I wrote to him that I thought they were both unwise,
                    and he fell ill last time and now this time. I would approve if he overworked
                    himself on normal things, but, as I said, this isn’t worth the powder expended
                    on it, and I wrote again to him: you’re a soldier and one of the few who have
                    cartridges in their box at the present time. Use them only in cases where a shot
                    is unavoidable.</p>
                <p>I fear — dear brother — that the money you loaned to our dear cousin H. has
                    currently taken the form of a vicious gun dog, for instance, or some similar
                    curiosity, since I believe he’s quite often mistaken about such purchases — and
                    then later it’s sometimes impossible for him to bring it back from that form to
                    the state of banknotes or to cash it in because, like other lovers of horses and
                    hounds, he’s caught in the snares of some crooked dealer. I’m one of those who
                    wish him as much good fortune as possible in these negotiations, and would like
                    to see nothing better than that their outcome is that he may speedily return
                    what he owes you. At one time there were big plans to populate the plantation
                    with countless dogs. This livestock farming is highly commendable, but at
                    present I want to say no more about it than that I hope it may prove exceedingly
                    profitable.</p>
                <p>Is your patient already discharged from hospital? But there may still be worrying
                    days, no less grave than when she was in there. Michelet says rightly: a woman
                    is an illness. They are changeable, Theo — they are changeable like the weather.
                    Now those with an eye for it see something beautiful and good in all weathers,
                    find snow beautiful and burning sun beautiful and storm beautiful and calm
                    beautiful, cold good and heat, are fond of all seasons and don’t want to miss a
                    single day of the year, and are fundamentally content and resigned to things
                    being as they are — yet even if one looks at the weather and the changing year
                    like this — and the changing female nature in the same way — believing that in
                    the essence of that nature, in its mysteriousness, there is a Reason — accepting
                    where one doesn’t understand — even, I say, if one should view it in that way,
                    our own nature and vision isn’t always and at every moment in harmony and accord
                    with that of the woman with whom we’re united, and individually one feels either
                    concern or dissatisfaction or vacillation, despite the belief and the good
                    spirits or serenity one may have. I was told by the professor who delivered her
                    that the complete cure of my woman would take years. That is, the nervous system
                    remains tremendously sensitive, for example, and she has that changeableness of
                    women very strongly. The great danger is — as you will understand — tumbling
                    back into old mistakes.</p>
                <p>This danger, although of a moral nature, has links with the physical
                    constitution. And I have constant and sometimes serious concerns about what I
                    would call these lurches between getting better and lapsing back into old bad
                    habits. <stress reason="love">Her mood can be such that it’s almost unbearable,
                        even for me,</stress> quick-tempered, wilfully wrong, in short, sometimes I
                    despair. It passes — and more than once she has said to me later — I DON’T
                    MYSELF KNOW WHAT I’M DOING THEN. Do you remember writing to me last year that
                    you feared that I would be burdened with the mother? Sometimes I wish things had
                    taken that turn. The mother is very sturdy when she wants to be, and could have
                    done so much better than she has. Now she sometimes obstructs more than she
                    helps. Anyway, when the woman does something wrong it’s sometimes the mother’s
                    fault, and when the mother does wrong it’s sometimes the family who are behind
                    the mother. Things which aren’t so bad in themselves but which prevent progress
                    and overwhelm or neutralize better influences. My woman has certain faults and
                    defects in the way she acts — that’s bound to be the case. THAT DOES NOT MAKE
                    HER BAD in my view. Still, those defects must be eliminated — habits of laxity,
                    indifference, lack of activity and deftness, oh, a mass of things. But all with
                    the same root — wrong upbringing, years of an utterly wrong view of life, fatal
                    influences of bad company.</p>
                <p>I tell you this in confidence, mind — and not out of desperation but so that you
                    will understand that for me this love isn’t a bed of roses, but something as
                    prosaic as Monday morning. A small painting by Tissot showed a figure of a woman
                    in the snow amid withered stalks. Way of flowers, way of tears. Well, my woman
                    no longer walks on a way of flowers as she did when she was younger and pleased
                    herself and followed her inclination, but life has become thornier for her and
                    become a Way of tears, especially last year — yet this year has thorns too, and
                    the following years as well — still, by persevering she will overcome them.
                        <stress reason="love">But sometimes there’s a crisis</stress> — particularly
                    when I venture to raise the matter of some fault of hers that I’ve been quietly
                    observing for a long time. For example, just to mention one thing, mending the
                    clothes and making the children’s clothes herself. But that ends with her
                    getting down to it one day, and she’s already much improved in this respect and
                    in other respects. I must change so much in myself too, but I must ensure that
                    in me she has an example of working and of patience, <stress reason="love">and
                        that’s damned difficult, brother, to be so that one can indirectly show
                        someone how to do something, and I too fall short sometimes,</stress> I must
                    raise myself to something better in order to awaken her interest.</p>
                <p>The boy, above all, is doing extremely well, though — the girl was very ill in
                    the past and neglected. But the little lad is a miracle of high spirits, already
                    appears inclined to oppose social institutions and conventions. For instance, as
                    far as I know all children are brought up on a kind of bread porridge. But he
                    has refused that with the greatest determination. Although as yet without teeth,
                    he bites firmly into a piece of bread and gets down all kinds of eatables while
                    all the time smiling and crowing and making noises, but his mouth stays firmly
                    shut for porridge &amp;c. &amp;c. He often sits with me in the studio on the
                    floor in a corner on a couple of sacks or something, he crows at the drawings
                    and is always quiet in the studio because he looks at the things on the wall.
                    Oh, he’s such an agreeable little lad.</p>
                <p>The number of studies keeps growing — when you come I think you’ll find some to
                    put in a portfolio in your room perhaps, anyway that’s up to you, as long as you
                    clearly understand that you may of course regard anything you take a liking to
                    as your own. Other things must come forth from the studies, though, and better
                    studies come from the old ones. I myself don’t know exactly how. But I do long
                    for you to see them again. I saw with great interest a publication, Le Salon
                    1883, a first issue of a series of illustrations, some deuced good. Done with
                    that new way of reproduction. I’ve subscribed to it, although I have enough
                    expenses, with a view to what I’m doing myself at present with the printer’s ink
                    and lithographic crayon. Listen, I definitely believe that some of my things
                    would do well if reproduced in that way — particularly those that have the more
                    intense blacks obtained by lithographic crayon and printer’s ink; I can also get
                    the brownish wash that I often come across in the above prints. Well, when you
                    come perhaps we can arrange one thing and another. And perhaps I’ll write down a
                    detailed statement of several matters about which I need information, and you
                    could take some of my studies together with that to show to Buhot, for instance,
                    who would then probably shed light on a few things for me.</p>
                <p>Recently read Un mâle by Camille Lemonnier — very strongly done in the manner of
                    Zola. Everything observed from nature and everything analyzed. Saw a big
                    Fromentin, a battle of fellahs, in the window at G&amp;C. Also saw the
                    nouveautés, perhaps not all of them. I again came across Julien Dupré, whom I
                    wrote to you about, in two things that I found less beautiful and more
                    conventional than what I saw by him in an illustrated magazine in the winter.
                    Did you already know that Rappard’s painting has been accepted this time in
                    Amsterdam? Well, it’s late already — thanks for your timely dispatch — <stress
                        reason="friendship">I just hope that R’s ‘letter follows’ doesn’t take too
                        long,</stress> or that H. v. G.’s livestock farming may prosper.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>I wanted to let you know in just a word or two that Rappard has been to see me
                    and that I’ve borrowed 25 guilders from him, with the promise of repayment in
                    the autumn. I was delighted by his visit — he came in the morning and stayed
                    until the last train in the evening, and we spent the whole day looking at one
                    thing and another, and he did a sketch using printer’s ink and turpentine to try
                    it out. Now I’m going to him tomorrow to see his work and his studio. <unstress
                        reason="environment">It was a truly enjoyable day</unstress> — he was rather
                    changed in both his appearance and his manner — for my part I find him much
                    better like this than before. He’s broader in the shoulders, and in his views on
                    many matters as well, I believe.</p>
                <p>Well, the money from him has helped me to get many things I needed; it was badly
                    needed. I used it, among other things, to have large sketchpads made for
                    outdoors. I had to keep back some money for a pair of trousers, though, and
                    tomorrow there’s the cost of travelling to Utrecht. But it still helps. In
                    addition, I was surprised by a very brief visit from Pa. Neither he nor I
                    mentioned your news about the woman. Pa probably thought I didn’t know yet, and
                    I kept to our agreement. I think Pa was rather taken by the figures of workmen
                    I’m working on. Among the pads I’d made with the money from R. there’s one for
                    watercolours too. <work origin="new" stage="finished">I tried it out
                        straightaway, a hut in the dunes with a wheelbarrow &amp;c. in the
                        foreground, a figure of a digger in the background.</work> Ah, Theo. I’ll
                    get the hang of watercolour one day or another.</p>
                <p>In the last few days, or rather weeks, I’ve had the very pleasant company
                    outdoors of a young surveyor who was trying his hand at drawing. He showed me
                    drawings which I thought poor, and I told him why I thought they were poor.
                    After that I naturally expected to hear no more from him — <unstress
                        reason="friendship">but one fine day he approached me again, he had time now
                        and might he come with me outdoors?</unstress> Well, Theo, that chap has got
                    the hang of landscape drawing so well that these days he brings along truly
                    attractive sketches of meadows and woods and dunes. He has to take an
                    examination in October, however, and his father doesn’t want him to spend so
                    much time on it. But in my view he can easily combine his profession of surveyor
                    with drawing. He’s the same sort of young chap as Rappard when we first met him.
                    What he did before I knew him were horribly botched paintings, generally
                    atrocious. I began by telling him that first he should only draw for a while — I
                    had to make him draw lots of things, which he didn’t enjoy but he trusted me in
                    that. Well, this morning he asked if he might have another go at painting, and
                    that went extremely well now and he has scraped off all his old things.</p>
                <p>Am longing for a letter from you. Rappard sends his regards. Are things going
                    well for you, and for your patient? Pa did say that you’d written to them about
                    coming this summer. I can hardly tell you how I long for that. Saw The harvest
                    by Lhermitte in the Salon illustrated catalogue. It looks beautiful; how it
                    captures the truth of the work and of the peasant figure. Well, adieu, I hope
                    your letter comes soon for I have need of it again. I saw Arnold in town with
                    someone else, perhaps Tripp — they were walking with Mauve. But saw them in the
                    far distance. Because Mauve was in the middle I thought of Christ between two
                    thieves, or else the group, in dark silhouette against a sunlit wall, looked
                    like someone being taken in by two gendarmes. Anyway, those are figments of
                    one’s imagination, things as they might be seen.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo.</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>If you’re like me you sometimes have a sudden desire to look up someone you
                    haven’t seen in a long time. This is what happened to me with De Bock, and I
                    wanted to write to you about what I saw at his place. Because you also know him
                    from the past, even better than I do. The first thing I saw there in the hall
                    was a large sketch — an enormous windmill, entirely covered in snow, beside a
                    kind of canal or waterway. Half romantic, half realistic — a combination of
                    styles I find not unsympathetic. But it was far from finished — but
                    energetically tackled, and there was a fine, forceful effect in it. Anyway,
                    something that one always sees with pleasure, and it doesn’t bother me that it
                    isn’t finished — I’d like to have that piece by him hanging in my studio just as
                    it is, because it’s so expressive. Another sketch, that of the painting in the
                    Salon, was also beautiful, I thought, but even more romantic. There were also a
                    few paintings with blonder accents, various pleasing studies.</p>
                <p>The impression I got of him himself was just about the same as last year, perhaps
                    a shade more positive and more serious. I thought some sketches maturer and more
                    correct in tone and colour than last year, and the grounds firmer. But in my
                    view too much of the relative proportions of the planes and masses is still left
                    vague; keeping an eye on this sort of proportion is the hallmark of Corot and
                    Rousseau and Diaz, Daubigny, Dupré. What they all have in common, in my view, is
                    that they pay careful attention to that, and with them the backgrounds are
                    always expressive and not so disengaged.</p>
                <p>There are very spirited things in De Bock’s work, though, and one would view it
                    with more pleasure if the way things stand in their place was less visionary. He
                    ought to be rather more of a realist and then his work would be more brilliant. </p>
                <p>I also can’t understand why he doesn’t have some more variety. To give an
                    example, <work origin="new" stage="sketch">this week I did a few landscape
                        studies as well, one yesterday at De Bock’s, a potato field in the dunes;
                        the day before a spot under the chestnut trees; another, a yard with heaps
                        of coal.</work> Now it’s relatively rare for me to get round to drawing
                    landscape, but when I get round to it I immediately have 3 very different
                    subjects. Why doesn’t he, a specialized landscape painter, do that much, much
                    more instead of it always being a dune with a tree and a bit of marram grass?
                    All very fine in itself, but there’s so much that is just as fine and ought to
                    attract him, one would imagine. </p>
                <p>Anyway, you know all about that, again my impression of him is that he has most
                    certainly not gone downhill. Well, I wrote to you recently that I had been
                    thinking about moving, mainly in order to be closer to the sea. <stress
                        reason="money">I talked to Bock about houses in Scheveningen, but I must
                        stop saying the rent for my studio is high when I compare it with the costs
                        that others have; for instance, the house where Blommers used to live is to
                        let — the rent is 400 guilders and I pay 170 guilders a year.</stress>
                    Moreover, the studio is no bigger than mine, and as for the suitability of the
                    house I would stick to what I have now. De Bock himself pays the same as
                    Blommers. And this is in line with what I heard last year about average rents.
                    If it was a question of going to live by the sea, Scheveningen wouldn’t be
                    possible and one would have to go further away, Hook of Holland, say, or Marken. </p>
                <p>Now, though, I’m thinking of asking De Bock to let me have a corner of his attic
                    as a piedàterre and then leaving my equipment there so that I don’t need to lug
                    it around. If one arrives tired (if one didn’t need to work immediately that
                    slight fatigue wouldn’t matter, of course), the work is sometimes weak and the
                    hand is none too steady. One is just hot and tired enough to be bothered by it
                    if one walks and has to lug everything around. </p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="environment">So that piedàterre at De Bock’s and taking the
                        tram more often might perhaps be enough to be able to do something with the
                        sea and Scheveningen after all, more seriously than I’ve done so
                        far.</unstress> De Bock is to come to my place this week and we’re to
                    discuss it further. He’s thinking of moving himself and has rented until May,
                    and said that his house might stand empty for several months after all. We’ll
                    see. He asked after you warmly, and I said you’d probably visit him this summer.
                    His big painting in the Salon not sold of course. What did you think of that?
                    The reviews were rather mixed. I think it will work out, to be at Scheveningen
                    often this autumn with a piedàterre at his place. We’ll see — but I yearn very
                    much to do something with the beach. </p>
                <p>
                    <work origin="new" stage="sketch">Did a study this week of a barge puller and a
                        peat carrier</work> and <work origin="existing" stage="middle">I’m still
                        working on the potato grubbers.</work> I hope that, taking a turn now with
                    Bock, I’ll be able to get on with him; it could do both of us no harm, and
                    perhaps we can learn from each other. </p>
                <p>He’s bought a lot of antiques and his place looks very attractive, but I imagine
                    it must have cost him a great deal.</p>
                <p>Will you write soon? Now I’ve written to you about Bock as I did recently about
                    Rappard, that way you hear something about our acquaintances. Rappard is
                    travelling, still he wrote to me that he had got round after all to using
                    printer’s ink as I told him, and that it worked much better that way, namely
                    with turpentine. You know that I’ve always said my present studio was good,
                    especially after the alterations. <unstress reason="environment">Really, if I
                        think now of changing — I would much rather arrange things so that I don’t
                        need to move, because compared with others I’m very well off. Well, one is
                        always attached to something one has furnished oneself and one feels at home
                        there.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>See that you send me something soon, old chap, for I need it badly. </p>
                <p>De Bock has also taken to reading Zola and had read Le Nabab by Daudet as well.
                    Do you know Germinie Lacerteux by Jules and E. de Goncourt? That’s supposed to
                    be very good, in the manner of Zola. I’m going to get hold of it. </p>
                <p>I’ve ordered an instrument that’s known as a fixer which enables one to fix a
                    charcoal drawing out of doors while one works, then one can work it up. Am
                    looking forward to it. With Bock I’ve found splendid potato fields in the dunes
                    behind the lighthouse. </p>
                <p>Regards, old chap, I wish you well, and write soon. Adieu, with a handshake.</p>

            <ps>
                <p>Of late I’ve been absorbed in a drawing by Régamey of a diamond mine. At first
                    sight it’s no different from one of those superficial drawings the illustrated
                    magazines are full of — one is inclined to skip it — but if one looks at it for
                    a moment everything becomes so beautiful and so curious that one is entirely won
                    over. Régamey is clever. This print is by Félix, who often does the Japanese
                    things. </p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>I had already been looking out for your letter, more or less, and was again glad
                    of it. Thank you. I find what you write about the exhibition most interesting.
                    What was that old painting by Dupré that you thought especially beautiful? You
                    must write again to tell me. Your description of Troyon and Rousseau, for
                    instance, is lively enough to give me some idea of which of their manners they
                    are done in. </p>
                <p>There were other paintings from the time of Troyon’s municipal pasture that had a
                    certain mood that one would have to call dramatic, even though they aren’t
                    figure paintings. Israëls put it perfectly in the case of a Jules Dupré
                    (Mesdag's large one): ‘It’s just like a figure painting’. It’s that dramatic
                    quality that causes one to find a je ne sais quoi in it that makes one feel what
                    you say, ‘It expresses that moment and that place in nature where one can go
                    alone, without company.’ </p>
                <p>Ruisdael’s Bush has it strongly too. </p>
                <p>Haven’t you ever seen old Jacques that were perhaps a little overdone, a little
                    straining for effect — but not really — and for that reason were thought
                    particularly beautiful, even though not everyone considered them to be among the
                    finest Jacques? </p>
                <p>Speaking of Rousseau, do you know Richard Wallace’s Rousseau? An edge of a wood
                    in the autumn after rain, with a vista of meadows stretching away endlessly,
                    marshy, with cows in them, the foreground rich in tone. To me that’s one of the
                    finest — is very like the one with the red sun in the Luxembourg. </p>
                <p>The dramatic effect of these paintings is something that helps us to understand
                    ‘a corner of nature seen through a temperament’ and that helps us understand
                    that the principle of ‘man added to nature’ is needed more than anything else in
                    art, and one finds the same thing in Rembrandt’s portraits, for example — it’s
                    more than nature, more like a revelation. And it seems good to me to respect
                    that, and to keep quiet when it’s often said that it’s overdone or a manner. Oh,
                    I must tell you that De Bock came round — very pleasant. <unstress
                        reason="friendship">Breitner, whom I didn’t in the least expect because he
                        had apparently broken off contact completely some time ago, turned up
                        yesterday. That pleased me because in the past — when I was first here — he
                        was very pleasant to go walking with. I mean to go out together not in the
                        country but in the city itself, to look for figures and nice
                        scenes.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>Here in The Hague there isn’t a single person I've ever done that with in the
                    city itself; most think the city ugly and pass by all of it. And yet it’s really
                    beautiful in the city sometimes, don’t you agree? </p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="environment">Yesterday, for example, I saw workmen in
                        Noordeinde pulling down that part opposite the palace, chaps covered in
                        white from the clouds of plaster dust with carts and horses. It was cool,
                        windy weather, the sky grey, and there was great character in the
                        scene.</unstress> I saw Van der Velden once last year — at De Bock’s one
                    evening when we looked at etchings. I’ve already written to you that he made a
                    very favourable impression on me at the time, although he said little and wasn’t
                    much company that evening. But the impression he immediately made on me was that
                    he was a solid, genuine painter.</p>
                <p>It’s a square, Gothic head — something bold or daring, and yet gentle in his
                    look. Very broad build, in fact the exact opposite of Breitner and De Bock.
                    There’s something manly and strong in him, even if he says nothing and does
                    nothing special. I do hope I’ll get in closer touch with him at some point,
                    perhaps through Van der Weele. Was at Van der Weele’s last Sunday; he was
                    working on a painting of cows in the milking yard, for which he has several
                    substantial studies. He’s moving to the country for some time.Of late I’ve done
                    a few watercolours outdoors again for a change, <work origin="new"
                        stage="finished">a cornfield</work> and <work origin="new" stage="finished"
                        >a bit of a potato field</work>. <work mention="vague">And also drawn a few
                        small landscapes, to have something to go by for the settings of a few
                        figure drawings that I’m looking for.</work>
                </p>
                <p>These are the designs of the figure drawings, very superficially. Above, weed
                    burners, below, coming back from the potato field.</p>

                    <work origin="new" stage="planned">I’m seriously considering painting a number
                        of figure studies, mainly with a view to raising the standard of the
                        drawings.</work> It’s good news for me that you’re planning to come to
                    Holland at the beginning of August, for I’ve said often enough that I dearly
                    long to see you.</p>
                <p>I’m looking forward to hearing from you sometime as to how informed your woman is
                    about art. In any event, much will have to be done and cultivated in that
                    respect, I imagine. So much the better. In any case I hope she’ll get a sort of
                    album, for which I hope you’ll find a few sheets among the smaller studies.
                    Sometimes there are sheets in a sketchbook which still say something, even
                    though they’re only scratches. I’ll gather one or two things together before you
                    come. </p>
                <p>Well, I’ve spoken to De Bock again and I can leave my stuff with him when I go to
                    do studies in Scheveningen. </p>
                <p>I also hope to go and see Blommers again soon. I talked to De Bock about his
                    painting at the Salon, November, which I thought so beautiful, and the
                    reproduction in the catalogue. He should still have a sketch of it, and I’d like
                    to see it. </p>
                <p>As for going to London sooner or later for a while, long or short, I too believe
                    that there would be more chance of doing something with my work over there; I
                    also think that I could learn a great deal if I could make the acquaintance of
                    some people there. And there I wouldn’t be short of subjects to do, I assure
                    you. There would be beautiful things to do on the wharves beside the Thames.
                    Anyway, we must talk about various things again when you come. I hope you won’t
                    be in too much of a hurry; we’ll have rather a lot to deal with. I’d like to be
                    able to get some studies in Brabant again in the autumn. </p>
                <p>Above all I’d like to have studies of a Brabant plough, of a weaver and of that
                    village cemetery at Nuenen. Again, everything costs money.</p>
                <p>Well, regards, and thanks again for your letter and the enclosure. I wish you
                    well. Do you think about bringing the woman to Holland, or is that not advisable
                    as yet? I hope it happens. Adieu, old chap, with a handshake.</p>

            <sig>Vincent</sig>
            <ps>
                <p>I’m adding a word here to tell you something more about Breitner as well — since
                    I’ve just come back from his temporary studio here (you know that he really
                    lives in Rotterdam these days). You know Vierge or Urrabieta, the draughtsman
                    for L’Illustration. Well, at times B. reminds me of Vierge, but very rarely. </p>
                <p>When he’s good it looks like something done in haste by Vierge; but when he, that
                    is B., is too hasty or doesn’t work things through, which is usually the case,
                    it’s difficult to say what it resembles, for it looks like nothing — except like
                    strips of an old, faded wallpaper from I don’t know which era, but in any event
                    a very singular one, probably from long ago. Imagine, I go to the garret that he
                    has at Siebenhaar’s. It was furnished mainly with various matchboxes (empty),
                    and then with a razor or something, and a cupboard with a bed in it. I see
                    something leaning against the chimney, 3 endlessly long strips that I at first
                    think are sun blinds. But on closer inspection they turn out to be canvases in
                    this format. As you see from the above illustration, painted with a not
                    unmystical scene, probably taken from Revelation, one would imagine at first
                    sight. </p>
                <p>Yet I’m informed that they are artillery manoeuvres in the dunes. Off the cuff I
                    would put it at over 4 metres long by 3/4 of a metre. </p>
                <p>The second was a story of a man who was leaning against the wall on the extreme
                    left of the painting, while on the far right various types of ghostly women
                    stood gawking at him, while care had been taken to leave a substantial space
                    between these two groups. I was then informed that what was depicted in the
                    lefthand corner was a drunkard, and I wouldn’t venture to doubt that this may
                    just as well have been the maker’s intention as something else.The third is
                    almost better, and is a sketch of the market that he did last year, but since
                    then it seems it’s meant to depict a Spanish instead of a Dutch market, in so
                    far as one can make anything of it. </p>
                <p>Whatever merchandise is sold at the market (wherever it’s located, I for one
                    doubt whether it’s meant to be on this earth; it’s much more likely to strike
                    the naive beholder as portraying a scene on one of those planets visited by
                    Jules Verne’s miraculous travellers (by projectile)) – whatever merchandise
                    really is being traded is impossible to make out, but it’s faintly reminiscent
                    of a huge mass of preserves or sweets. You see, try to picture such a thing, but
                    it couldn’t be more absurd, and heavyhanded as well, and you have the work of
                    Friend Breitner. </p>
                <p>From a distance they’re areas of faded colour as on bleached and rotting and
                    mouldering wallpaper, and in that sense there are qualities in it that are
                    absolutely unpalatable to me.</p>
                <p>I utterly fail to understand how anyone could possibly come up with something
                    like that. It’s the sort of thing one sees when one has a fever — or impossible
                    and meaningless as in a dream that makes no sense at all. I take the view, quite
                    simply, that Breitner isn’t yet cured, and actually did it while he had a fever.
                    Which, given his illness last year, may be considered entirely possible. Last
                    year when I was cured but still couldn’t sleep and was feverish, I too had
                    moments when I wanted to force myself to work all the same and did some things,
                    though thank God not so absurdly big, and later on I couldn’t understand why I’d
                    done them.</p>
                <p>This is why I think that B. will be all right in the end, but I find this absurd.
                    In a corner lay a crumpled watercolour study of some birches in the dunes that
                    was much better and had nothing abnormal about it. But those big things are
                    nothing. </p>
                <p>I saw another one at Van der Weele’s, very ugly, and a head, very good, but a
                    portrait of Van der W. — that he’d started — again bad. </p>
                <p>So he’s making a terrible mess on a very big scale. I like the work of Hoffmann
                    and Edgar Poe on occasion. (Contes fantastiques, Raven &amp;c.) But I find this
                    unpalatable because the fantasy is heavyhanded and without meaning, and there
                    are almost no correspondences to what exists. I find it very ugly. </p>
                <p>But I regard it as a period of illness. Van der Weele has two rather curious
                    drawings by him, elegantly done in watercolour, which have a certain je ne sais
                    quoi of what the English call ‘weird’.</p>
                <p>I learned a lesson today from that visit, namely that one can count oneself lucky
                    if one is in relatively normal surroundings in today’s society, and doesn’t have
                    to seek refuge in a coffeehouse life which will make one begin to see things
                    ever more cloudily and confusedly. For the latter is his situation, about that I
                    have no doubt. Imperceptibly he has strayed terribly far from a calm, rational
                    contemplation of things, and now he can’t put down a single calm, reasonable
                    line or brushstroke as long as this stress continues. </p>
                <p>I wish I could offer him some company and diversion, I wish I could often take a
                    turn with him and perhaps make him a little calmer. You remember the painting
                    The madness of Hugo van der Goes by Wauters? In some things B. faintly reminds
                    me of a state of mind like Van der Goes’s. I’d not like to be the first to say
                    this, but I believe his work has already been discussed in these terms for some
                    considerable time.The remedy would be to look at length at the potato leaves
                    that are so deep and elegant in colour and tone at present, instead of driving
                    himself mad looking at lengths of yellow satin and pieces of gilt leather. </p>
                <p>Anyway, we’ll see how it goes. He’s intelligent enough, but it’s a kind of bias
                    towards eccentricity that he persists in regardless. If he deviated from the
                    normal for a reasonable motive, well and good, but here it’s a question of not
                    taking any trouble with his work either. I find it truly wretched and I hope he
                    recovers, but he has lost his way badly.</p>
                <p>This week I’m going to start in Scheveningen. I would have liked there to be room
                    for a little extra, then I would have bought some painting materials. </p>
                <p>I’m going to have photographs taken of a few drawings in cabinet format or
                    slightly larger (to see how they’d look on a small scale) by a photographer who
                    has photographed those drawings by Ter Meulen, Du Chattel, Zilcken. He does it
                    for 75 cents, that’s not expensive, is it? I’ll have the sower and the Peat
                    diggers done for now, the one with many smaller figures, the other with 1 large
                    figure. And if they work, later on when I have drawings I’ll be able to send you
                    photos to show to Buhot, say, to see if he thinks he can place them. They could
                    have the drawings themselves of the ones they want for reproduction or I can
                    redraw them on their paper. </p>
                <p>Regards again, Theo. Best wishes. </p>
                <p>Do write again soon. I’ll have the photos taken, for we must stick to our guns
                    with Buhot &amp; Cie. I must try to earn a little so that I can make a start on
                    something new and do some painting too, for I’m just in the mood for that. Mauve
                    not only had some unpleasantness with me but also, to give an example, had
                    unpleasantness with Zilcken. It’s only now that I’ve seen Z.’s etchings, and
                    just now photos of drawings by Zilcken at the photographer’s. Leaving myself out
                    of it, I hereby declare that I don’t understand what M. has against Z. His
                    drawings were good and not in the least bad; it’s capriciousness on Mauve’s
                    part. <stress reason="friendship">After all, I don’t think it very nice of C.M.
                        that I haven’t received one syllable in reply to my letter, in which I took
                        the trouble to do two croquis of the drawings in question.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="friendship">Nor do I think it nice of H.G.T. that he didn’t pay
                        a call after I’d made an attempt to break the ice.</stress> It’s rubbish to
                    say that he’s busy, because that’s not the reason in this case, he could find
                    the time to come once a year.I’m adding half a page to talk about Brabant. Among
                    the figures of types from the people that I did there are several with a
                    certain, what many would call oldfashioned, character, also in the approach. For
                    example, a digger who’s more like those one sometimes finds in the basreliefs
                    carved in wood on Gothic pews than a contemporary drawing. I very often think of
                    the Brabant figures, which I find especially sympathetic.</p>
                <p>
                    <work origin="new" stage="planned">Something I’d like to have terribly much, and
                        which I feel I can do, given certain conditions of patient posing, is the
                        figure of Pa on a path on the heath, the figure severely drawn with
                        character and, as I say, a stretch of brown heath with a narrow, white,
                        sandy path running across it, and a sky applied with some passion and evenly
                        expressed.</work>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <work origin="new" stage="planned">Then, for instance, Pa and Ma arm in arm — in
                        an autumn setting — or with a beech hedge with dry leaves.</work>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <work origin="new" stage="planned">I’d also like to have the figure of Pa when I
                        do a country funeral, which I’m definitely planning, although it would be a
                        great deal of trouble.</work>
                </p>
                <p>Leaving aside irrelevant differences in religious views, to me the figure of a
                    poor village pastor is one of the most sympathetic in type and character that
                    there is, and I wouldn’t be myself if I didn’t attack it sometime. </p>
                <p>When you come I’d truly like to consult you on what to do about travelling over
                    there. When you see my drawings of orphan men, for instance, you’ll understand
                    what I want and how I mean it. My aim is to do a drawing that not exactly
                    everyone will understand, the figure expressed in its essence in simplified
                    form, with deliberate disregard of those details that aren’t part of the true
                    character and are merely accidental. Thus it shouldn’t, for example, be the
                    portrait of Pa but rather the type of a poor village pastor going to visit a
                    sick person. The same with the couple arm in arm by the beech hedge — the type
                    of a man and woman who have grown old together and in whom love and loyalty have
                    remained, rather than portraits of Pa and Ma, although I hope they’ll pose for
                    it. But they must know that it’s serious, which they might not see for
                    themselves if the likeness isn’t exact.</p>
                <p>And should be a bit prepared, in the event that this happens, for having to pose
                    as I say and not change anything. Well, that will be all right, and I don’t work
                    so slowly as to make it a great effort for them. And for my part I would greatly
                    value doing it. Simplifying the figures is something that very much preoccupies
                    me. Anyway, you’ll see some for yourself among the figures I’ll show you. If I
                    went to Brabant, it should certainly not be an excursion or pleasure trip, it
                    seems to me, but a short period of very hard work at lightning speed. Speaking
                    of expression in a figure, I’m becoming more and more persuaded that it lies not
                    so much in the features as in the whole manner. I find few things as horrible as
                    most academic facial expressions. I would rather look at ‘Night’ by
                    Michelangelo, or a drunk by Daumier, or The diggers by Millet, and that large
                    woodcut by him, The shepherdess. Or at an old horse by Mauve &amp;c.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Before going to Scheveningen I wanted to have a brief word with you. I’ve
                    confirmed with De Bock that I’ll have a piedàterre at his place. I may also drop
                    in on Blommers now and again. And then my plan is to regard Scheveningen as
                    absolutely the main thing for a while, going there in the morning and staying
                    there for the day, or otherwise, if I must be at home, allocating that being at
                    home to the afternoon when it’s too hot and then going back there in the
                    evening. I’m sure this will give me new ideas, and rest, not through sitting
                    still but through a change of surroundings and activity. Otherwise, I’m still
                    deeply absorbed in work here. Had the Orphan man again today for something that
                    suddenly occurred to me and that I wanted to press ahead with before beginning
                    on something else. I must tell you that I’ve been to the orphanage again after
                    all on a visiting day. <work origin="new" stage="middle">That was when I saw the
                        gardener and drew him from the window. Well, I didn’t want to let that go,
                        and now I’ve got it down in roughly this form, as far as I can
                        remember.</work>
                    <good_health>Yesterday evening I received a present that gave me enormous
                        pleasure</good_health> (from those two surveyors — for a second one has
                    since joined in), namely a highly authentic Scheveningen jacket with a standing
                    collar, picturesquely faded and patched.</p>
                <p>I’ve sorted out my painting materials as far as was practicable, and replaced
                    what I lacked and equipped myself with tram tickets &amp;c.</p>
                <p>This morning I saw the negatives of three photos. I’m looking forward to the
                    prints, and have hopes that in this small form they’ll be something with which
                    we’ll be able to make approaches to the illustrated magazines. I’m also
                    considering having today’s gardener done as well, for that figure is much, much
                    more detailed than in this scratch, and the setting isn’t as dull as here. I
                    hope to be able to send you prints of the photos next week. </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="money">But, old chap, I would ask you to do your utmost to send
                        me a little more, if at all possible, for I’m already broke because of one
                        thing and another I absolutely had to have to be able to start in
                        Scheveningen.</stress> It needn’t be very much, but just something to tide
                    me over so that I’m not absolutely without a thing to drink in the dunes. </p>
                <p>The photos are Sower, potato grubbers and Peat diggers; the last seemed to me to
                    come out the best. </p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="friendship">Don’t you think that was kind of the surveyors?
                        They’re kind, cheerful fellows who’ve given me a lot of
                        companionship.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>They’re beginning to make really charming sketches, but are both about to take
                    their final examinations, <work origin="existing" stage="sketch">one to be a
                        surveyor</work> and <work origin="existing" stage="sketch">the other an
                        engineer.</work>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <work origin="new" stage="planned">When I’ve got my bearings in Scheveningen
                        I’ll bring the woman along now and then to pose, or at least to indicate the
                        position and size of figures.</work>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="family">I long for you dearly, old chap,</stress> I hope
                    there’ll be something in the work that will give you some pleasure and which you
                    think shows some progress. Bock saw some painted studies from last year and
                    thought they had something, but they please me less and less, I hope to do
                    better ones this year.</p>
                <p>On Sunday the photographer is coming to the studio to talk about which of the
                    figures I have would be best for photos. </p>
                <p>I’ll be in no little difficulty if you absolutely cannot send anything extra.
                    I’ve only taken what was definitely indispensable for the painting box, but have
                    nonetheless been left with next to nothing. </p>
                <p>The Scheveningen jacket is a nice surprise. I once wrote to you that things might
                    turn out as they did years ago when I was also living in The Hague — that at
                    first it would be a miserable time but become more agreeable later on.
                        <good_health>In many respects it has already become more pleasant and
                        agreeable of late.</good_health> Well, adieu, do what you can, and believe
                    me, with a handshake</p>
            </body>
            <close>Ever yours,</close>
            <sig>Vincent</sig>
            <ps>
                <p>Something I also wanted to say to you is that the figure studies for the large
                    drawings are, in my view, much better than the drawings themselves. </p>
                <p>That quite a large number of those figures are something that I at least have in
                    my studio and, I believe, will continue to be of use in the year ahead. It isn’t
                    that I’m dejected about the past year between your last visit and now, but if
                    the income could have been a little more, we’d have made more progress with
                    painting. It’s a question of not losing heart and not weakening.</p>
                <p>I’ll have everything in order by the time you come so that we can regularly look
                    through it easily.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="family">But make sure you spend a long time with me,
                        brother.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>When times are difficult we must give each other moral courage at the least, so
                    that we don’t give up when trials come.</p>
                <p>And if we can preserve our serenity, there’s hope of achieving something good
                    that stands firmly on its feet. In the company of other painters I try to appear
                    offhand and not doubting for a moment. </p>
                <p>If next year we can have painted studies, painted as steadily as the present ones
                    are drawn steadily, then I think we can consider the battle won for the time
                    being. </p>
                <p>Until then it will be a close thing, and if we can muster some strength we’ll
                    have to exert it to the utmost, and in no case can we have too much of it. </p>
                <p>I think friend Rappard won’t be disinclined to give us a helping hand now and
                    then.</p>
                <p>He told me recently that he had come back from my studio with new ideas — and I
                    too from his — but <bad_health>the strength I can muster at the moment doesn’t
                        amount to much.</bad_health>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="career">Although I haven’t heard a syllable from C.M. in reply
                        to my letter and croquis of Peat diggers and sand quarry, I’m not giving him
                        up completely.</stress> Last year he was in a bad mood about the last
                    consignment of drawings and wrote me a disagreeable note. To that I replied that
                    Rappard had seen the same drawings and instead of thinking them inferior to my
                    earlier ones he found them decidedly better. I was already ill at the time, and
                    received C.M.’s reply in the hospital. He had looked at them again, yes, there
                    were good things in them and when I had something else we would see. But I
                    didn’t want to take him up on that right away, until now. His not wanting to
                    have any contact now must be due to things he has heard about ‘misconduct’, that
                    I live with a woman and children without being married. For a time C.M. also
                    wanted little to do with Franken, his own brotherinlaw, for similar reasons; I
                    know because I was once walking in Paris with C.M. and he said to me ‘that’s
                    where my brotherinlaw lives but I can’t go there because he lives with “a low
                    woman”.’ However, I’ve deliberately kept C.M. in reserve for just such an
                    emergency, and I think it might be good if you were to show him some of the best
                    studies and say to him plainly that there’s hope of victory if we can only get
                    some more rope and persevere, and that I’m not just asking for money but, in
                    accordance with our first agreement last year, would like him to give me money
                    for studies which I myself would be very glad to buy back from him later, or
                    exchange for a watercolour or painting. </p>
                <p>In fact, I also have a certain promise from Uncle Cent that he would take
                    drawings from me, but I’ve never spoken to him about it again, and it’s two
                    years ago now.</p>

                <location>The Hague</location>
                <date>25 July 1883</date>
            </head>
            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>A man comes to me this morning who had repaired the lamp for me 3 weeks ago, and
                    from whom at the same time I bought some earthenware that he himself pressed me
                    to take. </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="money">He came to tell me off because I had just paid his
                        neighbour but not him. Accompanied by a lot of noise, swearing, ranting
                        &amp;c. I tell him I’ll pay him as soon as I receive money but that I don’t
                        have it at the moment, and that adds fuel to the flames.</stress> I ask him
                    to leave, and in the end I push him out of the door but, perhaps deliberately
                    letting things get to this point, he grabs me by the neck and throws me against
                    the wall and then flat on the floor. You see, this is the sort of thing from
                    which you can see the petty vexations one is faced with. A chap like that is
                    stronger than I am, right? — they aren’t at all ashamed. Well, all the small
                    shopkeepers &amp;c. one deals with for daily necessities belong to the same
                    type. They come themselves to ask you to take this or that from them or, if one
                    goes to someone else, they ask for your custom, but if one must unfortunately
                    put off payment for longer than a week it’s cursing and scolding. Anyway, that’s
                    the way they are, and what can one say? They themselves are sometimes hard
                    pressed. I’m telling you about this to show you that it’s rather urgent that I
                    make some money if possible. When I went to Scheveningen I had to leave one or
                    two others waiting. <bad_health>I’m a little worried, brother, and have
                        considerable sorrow and difficulty. I long for you to come because I want to
                        decide whether or not I should move. To carry on here I would need to earn a
                        bit more in general; the little that I lack makes life here
                        unbearable.</bad_health>
                </p>
                <p>Otherwise, I have so few setbacks in the work that all the petty vexations don’t
                    affect my pleasure in it and don’t prevent me doing one thing and another. There
                    are a couple of small seascapes at De Bock’s, one with a choppy, one with a calm
                    sea, a genre I’d very much enjoy pursuing. Yesterday a peasant cottage with a
                    red roof under tall trees. Well, I believe that painting figure studies would
                    help me with many things, I made a start with <work origin="new" stage="middle"
                        >one boy in the potato field</work> and <work origin="new" stage="middle"
                        >one in the garden by a cane fence</work>. I ought to be able to put some
                    effort into them. </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="money">The incident this morning is a sign to me that it’s a
                        duty to confer and to take a smaller place in a village if there’s no hope
                        of being a little better off here.</stress>
                    <unstress reason="environment">Otherwise, the studio here is practical enough,
                        and there’s no lack of beautiful subjects to do here. And it isn’t
                        everywhere that one has the sea.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>What I said to you about not feeling strong is true, it has now come down to pain
                    between the shoulders and in the lumbar vertebra, which I’ve had before from
                    time to time, but I know from experience that one must then be careful,
                    otherwise one gets too weak and can’t easily recover. </p>
                <p>
                    <bad_health>I’m relatively resigned to things. Circumstances have been a little
                        too much for me recently,</bad_health> and <stress reason="friendship">my
                        plan to win back old friends by working constantly and sensibly has been
                        shattered.</stress> Theo, there’s one thing that it would be good for us to
                    discuss at some point — I’m not saying that there’s any question of this right
                    now, but the days could become darker still and I would like us to agree on this
                    for that eventuality. My studies and everything in the way of work in the studio
                    is definitely your property. The question doesn’t arise now — I repeat — but in
                    due course, for instance because of unpaid tax, the things may be sold, and in
                    that case I would like to put the work in a safe place and out of the house.
                    It’s my studies that I can hardly do without for later work, things that have
                    taken me a great deal of trouble to do. <stress reason="money">So far there
                        hasn’t been a soul here in the street who pays tax, yet all have been
                        assessed for various sums, including me, and I have twice had appraisers
                        here</stress>; I drew their attention, however, to my 4 kitchen chairs and
                    unpainted table and said I wasn’t eligible to be assessed for so much. That if
                    they found carpets, pianos, antiques &amp;c. at a painter’s, they might not be
                    wrong to assess such a man as being able to pay, but that I couldn’t even pay my
                    paint bill, and that there were no luxury items but only children in my house,
                    and that consequently there was nothing to be had from me. They then sent me
                    demands and final notices but I ignored all that and said, when they came back
                    again, that it was pointless because I simply lit my pipe with them. That I
                    didn’t have it, and my 4 chairs, table &amp;c. wouldn’t raise anything anyway.
                    That they weren’t worth as much new as they wanted to assess me for. </p>
                <p>They have indeed left me in peace since, for months now. And other people here in
                    the street aren’t paying either. </p>
                <p>Still, now that we’re talking about this, I wish I knew where to store my studies
                    in such an event. Well, I could take them to Van der Weele, say, or someone.
                    Together with my tools. I always have a certain hope that when you come to the
                    studio sometime you will yet find things in which someone might possibly be
                    interested, even though they have no particular commercial value. </p>
                <p>There’s no lack of work. </p>
                <p>
                    <good_health>Despite everything, at heart I don’t have a feeling of dejection,
                        and on the contrary I can agree with what I read recently in Zola, ‘If at
                        present I’m worth something, it’s because I am alone and because I hate the
                        ninnies, the incapable, the cynics, the idiotic and foolish
                        mockers’.</good_health>
                    <good_health>But none of that can perhaps do away with the fact that I can’t
                        withstand the siege if I stay here.</good_health> I write about this very
                    matter because it’s at the beginning, and the manoeuvre of moving to a cheaper
                    place may perhaps be the solution, although it’s very urgent in itself purely
                    for the sake of spending less on accommodation. </p>
                <p>Van der Weele has the silver medal for his painting that he more than deserves,
                    I’m glad he has got it.</p>
                <p>I’ve thought a good deal about that painting by Van der W. because I saw it being
                    done in part, and talked quite a lot about it with him and was immediately
                    attracted by it. </p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="career">I believe, Theo, that I too could do something like
                        that through carrying on working regularly and calmly in the
                        future.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="money">But in any event, there would have to be a period of
                        constant painting in between, and for that there would have to be means, and
                        at present the prospect of getting them seems to me slight.</stress> Van der
                    Weele has managed it by sacrificing half of his time on things he doesn’t do for
                    pleasure but through which he raises the means to keep his painting box filled
                    and to eat &amp;c. Perhaps, perhaps, if there were to be some article in my work
                    that people wanted to have, I might be able to pull it off too. Otherwise I
                    don’t care much about selling in itself, other than as a means of being able to
                    keep going. I tell you plainly that few of the ideas about art with which I
                    became familiar during my time with Goupil — in so far as they had to do with
                    practice — have been borne out, although I’ve kept the same taste. Creating
                    things doesn’t take place as one imagines if one is a dealer, and the life of a
                    painter is different, the study is different. I would find it hard to say in
                    what sense, but Daubigny’s words, ‘my paintings that I value more highly aren’t
                    the ones that bring in the most’ are something I now believe, and if I’d heard
                    them when I was with G&amp;Cie, I would have thought he was just saying that as
                    a manner of speaking. Adieu, old chap — I’m a little worried, you can see from
                    what I’ve written about my skirmish this morning that people don’t treat me with
                    much consideration. They’d probably keep their distance more if one wore a top
                    hat and I don’t know what else besides. <bad_health>One has one’s sense of
                        things after all, and it isn’t pleasant.</bad_health> Anyway, I wish there
                    was something to be found in the work so that a little more leeway would be
                    possible. Adieu, write soon, I long for that so much.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="family">Pending your arrival there’s hardly a moment that I’m
                        not with you in my thoughts.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>These days I’m doing my best to paint some different studies so that you can see
                    something of them at the same time. </p>
                <p>
                    <good_health>And I feel fine when I seek distraction through this change of
                        work, for while I don’t literally do as Weissenbruch does and spend a
                        fortnight with the polder workers, I nonetheless act in the same spirit, and
                        looking at nature has a calming effect.</good_health>
                </p>
                <p>And, moreover, I have definite hopes of making considerable progress with colour
                    in this way. <work mention="vague">It seems to me that the latest painted
                        studies are more assured and sounder in colour.</work>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <work origin="new" stage="sketch">Thus, for example, a few I did recently in the
                        rain of a man on a wet, muddy road better express the mood, I
                        believe.</work> Anyway, we’ll see when you come. Most are landscape
                    impressions. I wouldn’t claim that they’re as good as the ones sometimes found
                    in your letters, since I often run into technical difficulties, but still I
                    believe they have something similar. </p>
                <p>
                    <work origin="new" stage="sketch">For example, a silhouette of the city in the
                        evening as the sun is setting, and a towpath with mills.</work>
                    <bad_health>Otherwise things are so wretched that I still feel faint if I’m not
                        actually at work, but I believe that is passing.</bad_health> I’m definitely
                    going to do my best to build up a reserve of strength, because I’ll need it if I
                    want to do a lot of painting, including figures. A certain feeling for colour
                    has been aroused in me of late when painting, stronger than and different from
                    what I’ve felt before. </p>
                <p>It may be that this recent malaise is connected to a kind of revolution in the
                    working method which I’ve sought for more than once already, and have thought
                    about a great deal. I’ve often tried to work less drily, but each time it came
                    out roughly the same. But these days, now that some weakening prevents me from
                    working as normal, it’s just as if this helps rather than hinders, and letting
                    myself go a little and looking more through my eyelashes instead of looking
                    sharply at the joints and analyzing how things fit together leads me more
                    directly to see things as patches of colour next to each other. I’m curious as
                    to how this will continue and where it will lead. It has sometimes surprised me
                    that I’m not more of a colourist, because my temperament would certainly lead
                    one to expect that, and yet up to now that has hardly developed at all. </p>
                <p>I repeat, I’m curious as to how it will continue — I see clearly that my recent
                    painted studies are different. If I remember rightly, you have another one from
                    last year, of a few treetrunks in the woods. I don’t think it’s particularly
                    bad, but it’s still not what one sees in studies by colourists. There are even
                    correct colours in it, but although they’re correct they don’t do what they
                    should do, and while the paint is highly impasted here and there, the effect
                    remains too meagre. I take this one as an example, and believe that the recent
                    ones that are less impasted are nonetheless becoming more assured in colour,
                    because the colours are more worked into each other and the brushstrokes are
                    painted over each other, so that it fuses together more, and one captures
                    something of the softness of the clouds or of the grass, for instance. </p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="career">At times I’ve been very concerned that I wasn’t making
                        progress with colour, and now I have hope again.</unstress> We’ll see what
                    happens. Now you can imagine how eager I am for you to come, for if you also see
                    that it’s changing I’ll no longer doubt that we’re on course. I don’t dare trust
                    my own eyes when it comes to my work. <work origin="new" stage="sketch">For
                        example, the two studies that I did while it was raining, a muddy road with
                        a small figure.</work> It seems to me that it’s the opposite of some other
                    studies — when I look at it I recognize the mood of that sad, rainy day, and in
                    the figure, though no more than a few patches, there’s a kind of life that isn’t
                    due to accuracy of drawing, for it isn’t drawn, so to speak. What I want to say
                    is that I therefore believe that in those studies, for instance, there’s
                    something of that mysteriousness that one gets by looking at nature as if
                    through the eyelashes, so that the forms simplify themselves into patches of
                    colour. </p>
                <p>Time will tell, but for the present I see something different in the colour and
                    the tone in several studies. </p>
                <p>Lately I’ve thought sometimes of a story that I read in an English magazine, a
                    tale of a painter in which a person featured who had also been weakened during a
                    difficult time, and went to a remote area in the peat fields and found himself
                    in the melancholy nature there, so to speak, and was able to paint nature as he
                    felt and saw it. It was very accurately described in the story, evidently by
                    someone who knew about art, and it struck me when I read it, and I’ve now been
                    thinking of it from time to time these past few days. </p>
                <p>Anyway, I hope we’ll soon be able to talk about it and confer together. If you
                    can, write again soon and, of course, the earlier you can send, the more I would
                    welcome it. </p>
                <p>With a handshake in thought.</p>

            <sig>Vincent</sig>
            <ps>
                <p>For no particular reason I can’t help adding something here that’s just a
                    recurring thought of mine.</p>
                <p>Not only did I start drawing relatively late, but on top of that I can’t count on
                    living for a great many years, relatively speaking. When I think about that
                    coolheadedly and calculatedly — as if estimating or measuring something — then
                    it’s in the nature of things that I can’t possibly know anything definite about
                    it.</p>
                <p>Yet through comparisons with various people with whose life one is familiar, or
                    in comparison with whom one believes one sees certain correspondences, one can
                    nonetheless put forward certain propositions that aren’t absolutely without
                    foundation. </p>
                <p>So as to the length of time in which to work that lies ahead of me, I believe I
                    may assume the following without being too hasty: that my body will endure for a
                    certain number of years come what may — a certain number, say between 6 and 10.
                    I dare all the more to assume this because at present there’s no immediate come
                    what may. </p>
                <p>That’s the period that I count on for sure, for the rest I would find it far too
                    airily speculative to dare to determine anything in myself, given that whether
                    or not anything is left after that period will depend precisely on these first
                    10 years, say. If one goes into a serious decline in those years, one won’t get
                    past 40; if one remains sufficiently well preserved to withstand certain shocks
                    to which a person is likely to be subject, solving more or less complicated
                    physical problems, then from 40-50 one is once more in new, relatively plain
                    sailing. </p>
                <p>Calculations about that are not on the agenda now, but plans for a period, as I
                    began by saying, of between 5 and 10 years are. My plan is not to spare myself,
                    not to avoid a lot of emotions or difficulties. It’s a matter of relative
                    indifference to me whether I live a long or a short time. Moreover, I’m not
                    competent to manage myself in physical matters the way a doctor can in this
                    respect. <stress reason="career">So I carry on as one unknowing but who knows
                        this one thing — ‘I must finish a particular work within a few years’ — I
                        needn’t rush myself, for that does no good — but I must carry on working in
                        calm and serenity, as regularly and concentratedly as possible, as
                        succinctly as possible.</stress> I’m concerned with the world only in that I
                    have a certain obligation and duty, as it were — because I’ve walked the earth
                    for 30 years — to leave a certain souvenir in the form of drawings or paintings
                    in gratitude. Not done to please some movement or other, but in which an honest
                    human feeling is expressed. Thus this work is the goal — and concentrating on
                    that thought, what one does and does not do simplifies itself in that it’s not a
                    chaos, but everything one does is one and the same aspiration. Now the work is
                    going slowly — all the more reason not to lose any time.</p>
                <p>Guillaume Régamey was, I believe, someone who doesn’t have much of a reputation
                    (as you know, there are two Régameys, F. Régamey paints Japanese and is his
                    brother), but was a character for whom I have great respect all the same. He
                    died at the age of 38, and a period of 6 or 7 years was devoted almost
                    exclusively to drawings that are in a very singular style and were done while
                    working was made difficult by physical problems. He is one of many — a very good
                    person among many good people. I mention him not to liken myself to him — I’m
                    not as good as he was — but to give an example of a certain selfcontrol and
                    willpower that held on to an inspiring idea that showed him the way to produce a
                    good work in serenity despite difficult circumstances.</p>
                <p>I see myself in a similar way — as having to do something with heart and love in
                    it within a few years, and do it with willpower. If I live longer, so much the
                    better, but I’m not thinking about that. In those few years SOMETHING MUST BE
                    DONE — that thought is my guiding principle in making plans for the work. A
                    certain desire to make every effort will thus seem to you all the more
                    understandable. At the same time a certain resolve to use simple means. And
                    perhaps you’ll also be able to understand that, for my part, I don’t view my
                    studies in isolation, but always have in mind the work as a whole.</p>

            <salutation>Dear brother.</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>I wish you could understand that I must be consistent in various things. </p>
                <p>You know what an ‘error in the point of view’ is in painting, namely something
                    very different from and much worse than a mistake in drawing this or that
                    detail. </p>
                <p>A single point determines the steeper or gentler incline, the way the sides of
                    the objects develop more to the right or to the left throughout the whole
                    composition. </p>
                <p>Well, there’s something similar in life. </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="money">When I say I’m a poor painter and still face years of
                        struggle — in my daily life I have to arrange things more or less as a farm
                        labourer or factory worker does — then that’s a fixed point from which many
                        things follow, which are thus taken out of their context if they’re viewed
                        other than in general.</stress> There are painters in other circumstances
                    who can and must act differently. Everyone must decide for himself. </p>
                <p>If I’d had other opportunities, other circumstances, and if nothing of a decisive
                    nature had happened, of course I would have been influenced in my actions.</p>
                <p>Now, though — and with all the more reason — because I, should there be the
                    slightest question of seeing it as me arrogating to myself something to which I
                    had no right, even if I had the right after all, but simply because of the
                    question being raised, <stress reason="family">I withdraw of my own accord from
                        contact with people who keep up a certain position, even from my family —
                        thus we’re faced by this fact, my firm intention to be dead to everything
                        except my work. Yet it’s difficult for me to speak about those otherwise
                        simple, ordinary matters, because they’re unfortunately connected to much
                        deeper things.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <bad_health>There is no greater ‘anguish’ than an inner struggle between duty
                        and love, both raised to a high level.</bad_health>
                </p>
                <p>When I say to you, I choose my duty, you know all about it.</p>
                <p>The few words about it that we exchanged on the road made me feel that nothing
                    has changed in me in this regard, <bad_health>that it is and will remain a wound
                        which I live above but which is there deep down and cannot heal — years from
                        now it will be what it was the first day.</bad_health>
                </p>
                <p>I hope you understand what a struggle I had with myself of late — this: whatever
                    happens (not enquiring about that what? for I don’t have the right to
                    investigate it) — I want to be on my qui vive about remaining an honest man and
                    being doubly attentive to duty.</p>
                <p>I never suspected nor do I suspect nor shall I suspect her of having financial
                    considerations as her motive, other than what was just and fair. <stress
                        reason="love">She went as far as was reasonable, others exaggerated. Beyond
                        that, though, you understand that I presume nothing as regards love for me,
                        and that what we said on the road goes no further</stress>. Things have
                    happened since that wouldn’t have taken place if at a certain point I hadn’t
                    been faced by a firm no, firstly, and, secondly, a promise that I would keep out
                    of her way. I respected a sense of duty in her — I have never suspected her,
                    shall never suspect her, of anything low. For my part I know one thing, that in
                    the first place what matters is not to deviate from what is duty, and that one
                    can’t compromise on duty. </p>
                <p>Duty is something absolute. The consequences? We’re not responsible for them, but
                    for the initiative of doing or not doing one’s duty, yes. Here one sees the
                    exact opposite of the principle that the end justifies the means. </p>
                <p>And my own future is a cup that cannot pass away from me except I drink it.</p>
                <p>So Thy will be done.</p>
                <p>Regards — safe journey — write soon — but you understand how I will approach the
                    future, with serenity and without one sign in my face betraying the struggle in
                    the deepest depths.</p>

            <salutation>Dear brother,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Coming home just now, the first thing I feel I have to do is to make a request of
                    you — a request which I have no doubt is necessary simply because you’ll see
                    from it that my intentions are the same as yours. It is: not to rush me in the
                    various matters we were unable to deal with all at once this time. For I need
                    some time in order to decide. <stress reason="family">As for my relative
                        coolness towards Pa, here’s something I want to tell you, because you
                        brought it up.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>About a year ago now, Pa came to The Hague for the first time since I’d left home
                    in search of peace, which I didn’t find there. Of course I was already with the
                    woman then and said, ‘Pa, since I don’t blame anyone for finding something
                    shocking in my behaviour, given the present conventions, I stay away of my own
                    accord from those who I believe would be ashamed of me. And you understand that
                    I won’t make it difficult for you, and as long as I haven’t yet got my affairs
                    in order and am not back on my feet, wouldn’t you think it better if I didn’t
                    visit you?’ If to that Pa had said something like ‘No, that’s going too far’, I
                    would have been friendlier since, but Pa’s reply was in between yes and no; it
                    was, Oh, do what you think best. </p>
                <p>Well, thinking thus that they were more or less ashamed of me, which tallied with
                    what you told me, I wasn’t a busy correspondent and nor was Pa, and neither his
                    letters nor mine were particularly confiding. This, between you and me, is only
                    to explain, not to draw further conclusions. The opposite of seizing the hand
                    and insinuating one’s way in when someone offers only a finger is to let go of
                    the hand that isn’t offered to us fully and freely. Or voluntarily going away
                    from where one is merely tolerated.Whether or not I was mistaken, what do I
                    know? There’s a bond between you and me which time can only strengthen if we
                    press on with the work, and that is art, and I have hope we’ll continue to
                    understand each other after all. </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="family">I fear I’ve said something to you about the work that I
                        ought to have put differently, and have a vague feeling that I must have
                        bothered you with something, because there seemed to be something the matter
                        when you left.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>I hope this will resolve itself.</p>
                <p>As to the work, what is becoming increasingly clear to me in everything since it
                    caught my attention is the meagreness of the execution. That would worry me if I
                    didn’t think it a natural consequence (which I believe I’ve also seen in the
                    early work of very many people I find sympathetic), a natural consequence of the
                    effort one must make to overcome the very first obstacles. <good_health>And,
                        looking back on recent years, seeing them full of trouble behind me. That
                        trouble having subsided, there will be another period of working, I
                        hope.</good_health>This error is so pervasive and its correction so badly
                    needed that we must see to it that we take steps to give us a period of calm.
                    And so work at it; otherwise it will stay like that. I am as my work is, and you
                    must take this into consideration a little. I don’t know whether or not you
                    think it would be better to see someone like Herkomer, Green or Small, for
                    instance, now or to wait until both the work and I myself have calmed down. I’d
                    be in favour of the latter. <bad_health>Things inside me may clear up soon, but
                        at the moment I’d rather not have to navigate through complicated London
                        affairs.</bad_health> As regards one or two things that you said to me when
                    you left, I hope you won’t forget that one or two things about my clothes
                    &amp;c. are somewhat exaggerated. If it were really so, well I’d be the first to
                    admit my fault, but it seems to me that it’s an old piece of gossip dragged up
                    from the past rather than based on recent observation — unless I’m out in the
                    fields or in the studio.You mustn’t rush me if you truly want to make this clear
                    to me. <stress reason="friendship">This year I’ve been completely outside any
                        kind of social circle, so to speak.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>And in truth haven’t bothered about clothes. </p>
                <p>If that’s all, it won’t be so difficult to change, will it?, especially now that
                    I have the new suit from you.</p>
                <p>But I sincerely wish that people would forgive me such failings rather than talk
                    about them. </p>
                <p>If I get irritated about this, it’s because I’ve already heard so much about it;
                    dressed up one time and less so another, and it’s a story like that of the
                    farmer, his son and the donkey, the moral of which, as you know, is that people
                    are hard to please. </p>
                <p>
                    <bad_health>It wasn’t so much that I got angry with you as that you astonished
                        me, because you know how much pain I’ve already suffered over it, and that
                        it has become a piece of gossip that won’t disappear whatever I
                        do.</bad_health> Anyway. At all events I have the new suit from you and the
                    old one, which is certainly still good, and so it’s over for the time being,
                    isn’t it?, and let’s say no more about it.If only I had got a bit further so
                    that it would be easier to sell, I would definitely say, you be the man who
                    takes care of business, I don’t want to have anything to do with selling, and
                    live entirely outside those circles.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, though, I can’t yet say that now, and you aren’t to blame for
                    that, but I ask you for patience in both our interests and for the sake of
                    peace. <stress reason="family">I’m terribly sorry that I make life difficult for
                        you — perhaps it will clear up by itself — but if you’re faltering, tell me
                        plainly. In that case I would rather give up everything than make you carry
                        a heavier burden than you can bear.</stress> Then I would certainly go to
                    London right away to look for anything, no matter what, even carrying bales, and
                    leave art for better times, at least having a studio and painting.When I look
                    back on the past, I always come up against the same fatal points that are still
                    not entirely clear to me and that coincide with the months August 1881 to
                    February 1882. That’s why I can’t help mentioning the same names all the time.
                    Which appeared to astonish you. </p>
                <p>Dear brother, don’t think of me as being anything other than an ordinary painter
                    facing ordinary problems, and don’t imagine there’s anything unusual when there
                    are hard times. I mean, don’t picture the future either black or brightly lit;
                    you’ll do better to go on believing in grey. </p>
                <p>Which I also try to do, and I consider it a fault if I deviate from that. </p>
                <p>Regards, and</p>

            <ps>
                <p>As for the woman, I don’t doubt that in any event you’ll understand that for my
                    part I shan’t rush matters.And as for how I think about selling, I wanted to say
                    this again. I believe that the best would be if we carry on working until,
                    instead of having to praise or explain it to art lovers or say something to go
                    with it, they feel drawn to it of their own accord. <stress reason="career">At
                        any rate, if it’s refused or doesn’t please, one must remain dignified and
                        calm as far as possible. I fear that my efforts when I present myself do
                        more harm than good, and I wish I could be spared that.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="friendship">It’s so painful for me to talk to most people, I’m
                        not afraid to, but I know I make a disagreeable impression. Attempts to
                        change that may well come up against the difficulty that the work would
                        suffer if one lived differently.</stress> And provided one perseveres with
                    the work, it will turn out all right later. Take Mesdag, a veritable mastodon or
                    hippopotamus, all the same he sells his paintings. I haven’t got as far as that
                    yet, but the person I mention also began late and worked his way up by an
                    honest, manly route, whatever else he may be. It’s not in the least because of
                    laziness that I don’t do this or that; rather it’s to be able to work more and
                    to leave aside anything not directly part of the work.Just to return briefly to
                    what you said on leaving: ‘I’m beginning to think more and more like Pa’. Well,
                    so be it, you speak the truth, and I for my part, while as I said not thinking
                    or doing exactly the same, respect this character and know of a weak side to it
                    perhaps, but also a good side. <stress reason="family">And when I consider that
                        if Pa knew anything about art I would doubtless be able to talk to him more
                        easily and agree with him more; suppose you become like Pa plus your
                        knowledge of art — fine — I believe we’ll continue to understand each
                        other.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>I’ve had repeated disagreements with Pa, but the bond has never been completely
                    broken. </p>
                <p>So let’s simply allow nature to develop: you will become what you become, I too
                    shan’t stay exactly as I am now. Let us not suspect each other of absurd things
                    and we’ll continue to get by. And let us reflect that we’ve known each other
                    from childhood, and that thousands of other things can bring us ever closer. </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="family">I’m a little concerned about what seems to be bothering
                        you, and doubt whether I know exactly what the trouble is. Or rather, I
                        believe the cause lies not so much in a particular, specific matter as in
                        the realization that there are points on which our characters diverge, and
                        that one of us understands one thing better and the other something else. I
                        believe that this is desirable, if you and I try to remain in
                        agreement.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="money">One thing — if I become too much of a burden on you — let
                        the friendship remain, even if you can give less help financially. I’ll
                        complain now and again — I’m in a fix over this or that — but without any
                        ulterior motive, and more just to say it for once than because I demand or
                        expect from you that you can do everything, which indeed I wouldn’t do, old
                        chap!</stress>It grieves me that I said things that I, for my part, would
                    like to take back entirely if need be, or wish I had left unsaid — or, supposing
                    you conceded they had a grain of truth in them, would like to have them regarded
                    as highly exaggerated. For be assured that the continuing main thought —
                    compared with which all the rest becomes as little as nothing — is and will
                    remain, whatever the future brings, a sense of gratitude towards you.
                    Furthermore, if I’m ever less fortunate in the future, in no circumstances — I
                    say in NO CIRCUMSTANCES — you understand — not even if you have to withdraw your
                    help entirely — shall I regard it as your fault. Which wouldn’t need to be said,
                    had I not said things more because of the strong effect of my nerves than
                    because I think you should have said something more adequate at the time when I
                    was calm. Forget about that, you’d be doing me a favour if you took that as
                    unsaid. I think that if that turns out all right, it will turn out all right by
                    itself through time when I’m calm, but in nervousness I blame it now on this,
                    now on that. </p>
                <p>It’s the same with other things, which I don’t want to drag up now, although I
                    later remember what I say, even in nervousness, and a grain of it may be right,
                    yet not all beginnings have a continuation, and in nervous tension they often
                    seem more than they are. </p>
                <p>For my part, although there seemed to be something wrong when you left, shall
                    also not go on about it. I do indeed think about what you say, and have already
                    written to you about clothes that I don’t refuse them and agree with you
                    completely — but would have known even if you hadn’t said it — that attention
                    would be paid to appearance if ever I were to go to Herkomer or someone. Also,
                    what you said about Pa — there was now a reason for writing more to Pa than
                    otherwise, and you will read the letter. And the same with everything else. </p>
                <p>In short, if I pass judgement on people, circumstances, circles in which I do not
                    move, it’s understandable that I don’t hit the mark but fantasize beyond nature
                    and see things very fantastically, just as everything becomes strange when seen
                    against the light. You, who are closer, don’t understand how it’s possible that
                    they can appear a little like that when seen at a distance, in retrospect. And
                    even if I saw everything totally wrong, anyone who thought it over would perhaps
                    understand that, given certain events, I can hardly speak otherwise. Where
                    things became confused was a brief period, and that brief period CANNOT but
                    occupy a place in my thoughts constantly, and I regard it as natural that that
                    moment must have a reaction in the future, because people, even if they
                    deliberately avoid each other, still inevitably end up facing each other in the
                    course of time.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>You’ll understand that I’m rather eager to hear from you whether you’ve read my
                    letter. As for myself, the course that’s the cheapest by our calculations — I
                    believe a village would be the answer — would seem to me the most sensible in
                    the given circumstances.</p>
                <p>If the 150 francs a month can continue, I believe we can cover the cost
                    completely, or nearly so. <stress reason="money">Dear brother, you see that it
                        doesn’t look as if there’ll be any leeway for me, in any event.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>I’ll try not to complain, and swallow what I can swallow.</p>
                <p>I remain convinced that actually more is required for the work, and that I ought
                    to be able to spend a little more on food and other needs, but if I must manage
                    with less — after all, my life may not be worth the food — why should I make a
                    fuss about it? And it isn’t anyone’s direct fault, not mine either.</p>
                <p>I hope, though, that you understand one thing — that one cannot do more than
                    scrimp, even on food, clothes, every kind of comfort, everything that’s really
                    needed. When one has stinted oneself even in those things, there can be no
                    question of unwillingness, can there?</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="career">You understand that if someone said to me, do this, do
                        that, do a drawing of this or that, I wouldn’t refuse, indeed I would try
                        repeatedly with pleasure if it didn’t work the first time. But no one says
                        that, or so vaguely, so in general, that it confuses me rather than helps me
                        on my way.</stress>Dear brother, regarding clothes, I’ve put on what I got
                    without wishing for more, without asking for more. I’ve worn clothes from Pa and
                    from you that sometimes fit my body differently and I can’t help that, also
                    because the waists may differ.</p>
                <p>If you won’t mention that my dress occasionally leaves something to be desired,
                    I’ll be content with what I have and even grateful for it, in no small measure,
                    although of course at a later stage I’ll return to it if I can, and hope to say
                    to you: Theo, do you remember the days when I went round in a long minister’s
                    coat of Pa’s &amp;c.?; and it seems to me that quietly registering things now
                    and laughing about them together later when we’re more on top of them is
                    infinitely preferable to arguing about them now. For the present, if I have to
                    go out I have your suit that you brought, and more that is presentable. Forgive
                    me if I don’t wear it in the studio or out of doors, that would be to ruin it
                    wilfully, because one always gets some stain or other when painting, and
                    particularly when trying to capture an effect in rain and wind.</p>
                <p>My view as regards earning money is as simple as can be; it is that it must come
                    through the work, and that in the circumstances I gain nothing by speaking to
                    people about it personally.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="career">Yet if I see a chance, I pursue it, for instance, what I
                        told you about Belinfante, and Smulders. But so far I’ve had little
                        luck.</stress> Well, I shan’t grieve about that as long as you don’t upset
                    me by suspecting me of being unwilling.For I believe that if you think about it
                    carefully you won’t doubt that I’m industrious, and if, moreover, you were to
                    demand that I asked people to buy from me, I would do it, but I might then
                    become melancholic. If possible, allow me to go on as before. If not, and if you
                    want me to call on people with my work, I shan’t refuse if you advise that.</p>
                <p>Yet, dear brother, human brains can’t withstand everything. Take Rappard, who got
                    brain fever and has now gone all the way to Germany to get rid of it.
                        <bad_health>I become more agitated than is good for me when I take steps
                        like going to people to talk about the work.</bad_health> And what do I come
                    away with? A refusal or a fobbingoff.</p>
                <p>It wouldn’t agitate me if it was you, say, who know me and to whom I’m used to
                    speaking.</p>
                <p>I tell you, I feel less energetic outdoors when I’ve been among people.</p>
                <p>If we don’t waste time with steps of that kind, we’ll make progress slowly but
                    surely, and I know of no better way.</p>
                <p>In no case shall I refuse a serious commission, whatever is asked for, to my
                    liking or not, I’ll try to do it as required, or do it again if required.</p>
                <p>In short, I resolve not to get impatient in any event, even if people were
                    deliberately to make it difficult for me.</p>
                <p>I can’t say more than that, and if you care to commission something from me, you
                    can carry out a test, or several tests. I’m at your disposal.I believe there’s a
                    difference between now and the past. In the past more passion went into both the
                    making and the judging of work. One made a definite choice for this or that
                    movement, one enthusiastically backed one side or another. There was more verve.
                    Now I believe there’s a spirit of caprice and satiety. People are generally more
                    lukewarm. For my part, I wrote to you before that it seemed to me that since
                    Millet a sharp falling off was evident, as if the peak had already been reached
                    and decline had set in.</p>
                <p>This affects everyone and everything.</p>
                <p>I’m always glad that I saw the collection of drawings by Millet at the Hôtel
                    Drouot.</p>
                <p>At the moment you’re in Nuenen.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="family">I wish, brother, that there were no reasons for me to be
                        absent. I wish we were walking together through the old country churchyard
                        or at a weaver’s.</stress> Now that isn’t so. Why not? <bad_health>Oh,
                        because I realize that I would seem like a spoilsport in the given
                        atmosphere.</bad_health>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="family">Theo, again — I don’t entirely understand it, and think
                        it has gone rather too far when both you and Pa feel ashamed to walk a
                        little with me. For my part I’ll keep away, though my heart yearns to be
                        together.</stress> At least, given that I at any rate can’t do without that
                    brief moment of seeing either you or Pa with no reservations for once — solely
                    because of unbreakable bonds — henceforth I would like us never again to discuss
                    the question of conventions or clothes when we see each other. <bad_health>You
                        see from everything how instead of insinuating my way in I withdraw as far
                        as possible.</bad_health> But conventions mustn’t cause a general cooling.
                    That one point of light that we see each other briefly once a year mustn’t be
                    clouded over. Adieu,</p>
            </body>
            <close>Ever yours,</close>
            <sig>Vincent</sig>
            <ps>
                <p>As to the work, I don’t hesitate. You’ve read Fromont Jeune and Risler aîné,
                    haven’t you? I do NOT see you in Fromont Jeune of course, but I do see a
                    resemblance between myself and Risler aîné — in his absorption in his work, his
                    decisiveness in that, while otherwise he was an ‘ordinary chap’ and fairly
                    nonchalant and shortsighted, his few wants for himself, so that he changed
                    nothing for himself when he became rich.</p>
                <p>As regards my work all my ideas are so ordered, so definite, that I believe you’d
                    do well to accept what I say: let me get on with it as I am; my drawings will
                    become good if we stay on the normal footing with each other, <stress
                        reason="money">but because the improvement depends a little on the money for
                        my outgoings and expenses — and not only on my efforts — be as generous as
                        you can with the money, and if you see a chance to add any help from another
                        quarter, don’t let it slip.</stress> But in fact these few lines contain
                    everything I have to say.</p>
                <p>You mustn’t let yourself be misguided as to my true character by my actions when
                    I left Goupil. If the firm had been for me then what art is for me now, I would
                    have acted more decisively then. But in fact I was unsure then about whether it
                    was my career or not, and I was more passive. When I was asked, wouldn’t you
                    like to leave?, I said, you think I should leave?, then I’ll leave. No more than
                    that. There was more silence then than talk.If it had been dealt with
                    differently, if they’d said: we don’t understand how you acted in this or that
                    case, explain it, it would have turned out differently. </p>
                <p>I already told you, brother, discretion isn’t always understood. Too bad,
                    perhaps. It’s better I have the career I have now, I believe, but when I left
                    Goupil there were motives other than clothes, on my side at any rate.</p>
                <p>There was a half or whole plan then for me to get a position in paintings at the
                    new branch in London, which in the first place I didn’t consider myself suitable
                    for, and in the second had no interest in. I would have liked to stay with the
                    firm if I’d been given a position that consisted less exclusively of talking to
                    the customers.</p>
                <p>In short, if I’d been asked then, do you enjoy the business?, my answer would
                    have been, yes, certainly. Would you like to stay? Yes, if you consider me worth
                    what I earn and don’t consider me a hindrance or harmful. Then I would have
                    asked for a position at the printer’s perhaps, or for the one in London — but
                    slightly altered — and would have got it, I believe.</p>
                <p>They didn’t ask me anything, though, just told me, ‘You are an honest and
                    hardworking employee but you set a bad example to the others’, and I said
                    nothing to refute that because I didn’t want to influence whether or not I would
                    stay.</p>
                <p>I could have said a great deal to refute that, though, if I had wanted, and
                    indeed things that I believe would have ensured that I could stay. I say this
                    because I don’t understand how you couldn’t know that it was a question not of
                    dress but of very different matters. <unstress reason="career">Well — to you — I
                        say what I don’t doubt is right to say now, given that my profession is my
                        profession and I don’t doubt that I should stay in it.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>So I say this to you: not only do I wish to keep things between us as they are,
                    but I’m really so grateful for our relationship that I only enquire about poorer
                    or richer, more or less difficult, taking nothing for granted, that I’m content
                    with all conditions and will fit in, adapt, make do if need be.</p>
                <p>But I desire only that you shouldn’t doubt me with respect to good will,
                    application — and grant me a little common sense so that you don’t suspect me of
                    doing silly things, and so quietly let me carry on working in my normal way.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="money">Of course I must seek in order to find, and not
                        everything will come off by a long way, but in the end the work will be
                        good.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>Patience until it’s good, not letting go until it’s good, not doubting, is what I
                    would like you and I to have together and to hold on to. If we hold onto that, I
                    don’t know to what extent we’ll benefit financially, but I do believe that — on
                    condition of collaboration and solidarity, however — we’ll be able to persevere
                    for our whole lives, sometimes selling nothing and finding life hard, then at
                    times selling and having it easier.</p>
                <p>That’s sufficiently brief and to the point. Persevering depends on our will to
                    stay together. As long as that will exists, it is possible.Now I mention Risler
                    aîné again (I believe you know the book, if not read it sometime, and what I
                    mean will be clear to you) and point out to you how that man’s appearance was
                    more or less like mine, how his life was working in the attic of the factory on
                    his designs and machines, how he had no time for or interest in anything else
                    for that matter, and his greatest luxury for himself was to drink a glass of
                    beer with an old acquaintance.</p>
                <p>The story in the book is one that’s of no importance here, other things in the
                    book aren’t relevant. I draw your attention to the character, the way of life of
                    Risler âiné in itself, without any thought of anything else in the story. Really
                    only to explain to you that I think very little about my clothes because of my
                    way of working — of doing business, if you like – is working personally, NOT
                    approaching people.</p>
                <p>A few friends I’ll have later will, believe me, take me as I am. I think you’ll
                    understand this letter, and understand that it isn’t a case of me getting angry
                    when something is said to me about clothes. <good_health>No, inside I’m becoming
                        ever more calm and concentrated, and something very different would be
                        needed to make me angry.</good_health> Wherever I went, I would be roughly
                    the same — perhaps really making a bad impression everywhere in the beginning.
                    But I doubt whether that would remain for ever with the people I talked to about
                    it face to face.</p>
                <p>Well, from this moment on I’m again completely absorbed in the work. Do for me
                    what can be done, think yourself about what could be useful or help us to get
                    somewhere more quickly. I don’t doubt your good will or friendship. Regards,
                    enjoy your days, and write soon.</p>
                <p>Adieu.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>I couldn’t yet go into detail about my plans in my last letter, but now I can in
                    some respects.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="love">I’ll begin my telling you that I now know for certain that
                        one thing and another that I already suspected as regards the woman is true
                        — that recently she was negotiating about her future even before I’d come to
                        the decision to separate. I had to decide to separate, precisely because I
                        was almost as certain of that then as I am now that I know more exactly what
                        the plans were.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>Having taken the decision, I wanted to go ahead with my travel plans without
                    delay. </p>
                <p>The first measure to be taken was to give notice to the landlord — that has now
                    been done. </p>
                <p>The second measure is what to do with my things, which would be an encumbrance
                    and lead to costs at a time of not knowing exactly where I’ll stay for long.
                    They’ll stay here in this house in the attic, since I’ve agreed this with my
                    landlord. You will ask, do I have plans to come back to The Hague then? No. </p>
                <p>But in, say, 1/2 a year or 1 year I may have to get in touch with some painters
                    here, when I’ve got much further, when I have a batch of studies of the real
                    countryside. </p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="money">And then for a while I’ll probably take a room or
                        rather an annexe well suited for use as a studio from the same landlord in
                        his own house in VOORBURG, not in The Hague, which will be much cheaper for
                        me than living here in the city, which I shan’t readily do again.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>So I’m relieved of superfluous encumbrances, and know at once where to head for
                    if I reach a point (certainly not for the time being, of course, but say in 1
                    year) when a temporary return here would be feasible. <unstress reason="career"
                        >Why? — because, for instance, by that time I might be able to become a
                        member of the Drawing Society, just to mention one thing. Which is one of
                        the things I might desire and could achieve then.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>You’ll agree with me that The Hague is a very remarkable place. It really is the
                    centre of the art world in Holland, and at the same time the surroundings are
                    varied and extremely beautiful, so that one can always work there.And so —
                    though certainly not for the time being — after a period of 1 year, say, there
                    will probably be a reason for being here for a brief or a longer stay. And
                    through this arrangement regarding my things I stay in touch with someone who
                    knows me and so can at any rate find me a place to live, if I ask. </p>
                <p>So I’m a free man without encumbrances, I can leave when I like. </p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="money">And I can now do more with the 150 francs from you than
                        when so much had to come out of it.</unstress>
                    <good_health>And because I have some relief from worries that were
                        nerveracking.</good_health>
                </p>
                <p>The travel costs are made much simpler in this way. <stress reason="love">The
                        only ‘drawback’, ‘disadvantage’ or whatever you want to call it is that, for
                        my part, I really did have hope that the woman would turn out all right in
                        Drenthe, and now have grave doubts about that. It’s certainly her own
                        behaviour that made me decide to act, but if I’d been able to find the means
                        I’d have taken her to Drenthe nonetheless, in a final attempt for
                        her.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>Well, I had to decide, because every week of delay got me more entangled in
                    thorns here, without any progress with her. </p>
                <p>If I took my things, a 1/2 wagon to Drenthe would certainly cost something more
                    than 25 guilders, according to a revised calculation by Van Gend &amp; Loos,
                    because there’s also the cost of delivering to and collecting from home,
                    although this isn’t all that much. </p>
                <p>Well, some packing cases would be needed, which I would have to buy, and that’s
                    another expense. </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="money">It would have been convenient to have my things, but it
                        works out too expensive, and especially if one moved about over
                        there.</stress>
                    <work origin="new" stage="planned">I would first like to have a look at Katwijk,
                        to do some sea studies, and because that at any rate is within reach, even
                        if the journey to Drenthe has to wait a while on account of the
                        money.</work>
                </p>
                <p>Oh, Theo, you’ll understand my feelings in recent days, a great melancholy about
                    the woman and the children, but it couldn’t be otherwise — at the same time all
                    my thoughts are about work and I’m really eager, because now I can do things
                    which would have been impossible for me otherwise. </p>
                <p>Dear brother — if you could feel precisely what I’m feeling, and how I’ve devoted
                    a piece of myself, so to speak, to the woman, namely forgetting everything else
                    and concentrating on getting her back on her feet — if you could feel precisely
                    a kind of sadness about life, which doesn’t, however, make me indifferent to it,
                    on the contrary, I would rather have my sorrow about one thing and another than
                    forget or become indifferent — <bad_health>if you could feel precisely the
                        extent to which I draw my serenity from worship of sorrow and not from
                        illusion — perhaps even for you brother, my inner self would be very
                        different and more detached from life than you can now imagine.</bad_health>
                    I’ll certainly not say much more about the woman, but I’ll still continue to
                    think about her often. From the beginning, with her, it was a question of all or
                    nothing when it came to helping. I couldn’t give her money to live on her own
                    before, I had to take her in if I was to do anything of use to her. <stress
                        reason="love">And in my view the proper course would have been to marry her
                        and take her to Drenthe. But, I admit, neither she herself nor circumstances
                        allow it. She isn’t kind, she isn’t good, but neither am I, and serious
                        attachment existed throughout everything as we were.</stress>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>I’ve got so far with packing &amp;c. that I’ll leave as soon as I have the travel
                    money. It’s best in the circumstances that I set to work straightaway. For
                    during the removals &amp;c. one can’t do anything good in the way of work, and I
                    shan’t get back into my stride until I’m somewhere in the country. So I hope to
                    be able to get away if you send something towards the 10th, if I can’t go
                    straight through I’ll stay in a village close by for a day or two if need be. </p>
                <p>I hope things will turn out as you think possible, indeed as I do too, more or
                    less, that it will make the woman change direction for the better. <stress
                        reason="love">Yet I fear that won’t happen and she’ll go down the old
                        road.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>If I judge by my intimate knowledge of her, she’s too weak in spirit and
                    willpower in particular to continue on a proper course.</p>
                <p>When I talked about it during your visit I was determined to decide, but in my
                    view there were two roads, and the decision as to how depended more on her than
                    on me. If she had definitely wanted to carry on with me, so that it was
                    something more than words and a turning away from those faults that had made the
                    situation impossible, I believe that it would have been a better lot for her
                    than that awaiting her now, however difficult and poor things might have been
                    for us. But I saw in her something like a sphinx that cannot say either yes or
                    no. And if you were to ask me if I knew what she’s going to do, all I know is
                    this, ‘certainly not as straight as she could have done’. </p>
                <p>In recent days I again saw clearly how looking at the advertisements was done
                    merely for the sake of appearances, and that they’re probably waiting for my
                    departure before embarking on something they don’t discuss with me. </p>
                <p>All the more reason for me to leave immediately, for otherwise they’d resort to
                    delaying things deliberately. And the mother again has a hand in this.</p>
                <p>This plan, which is again a twisting of what they began a few days ago, will
                    almost certainly lead to nothing but wretchedness. </p>
                <p>But I would have to be mad to help when they’re not being open with me, wouldn’t
                    I? So I intend simply to leave and to let fourteen days or so go by. Then I’ll
                    write to them and see how things are. </p>
                <p>I’m also beginning to think that I must leave in order to make them be serious.
                    But such a test is dangerous, for even in a short time they can spoil a great
                    deal. </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="love">Why, why is the woman so unwise? She’s what Musset has
                        called ‘A child of the age’ through and through — and I sometimes think of
                        the ruin of Musset himself when I consider her future.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>There was something elevated in Musset; well, in her there’s also a je ne sais
                    quoi, although she’s certainly not an artist. If only she were, a little. She
                    has her children, and there’ll be something solid in her if they become her idée
                    fixe even more than they are now, but that too isn’t what it should be, even
                    though her mother love, although imperfect, is still the best thing in her
                    character, in my view. </p>
                <p>It’s a difficult thing for me that I assume that, once I am gone, she’ll regret a
                    few things and want to be better and will need me. I’m ready to help in that
                    case, but I’ll get into her head what you told me about the woman you met, you
                    found me when I had sunk very low, I must climb up again. Instead of I must
                    climb up again, she will say the abyss draws me. </p>
                <p>I once heard that there was a relationship between Musset and George Sand. George
                    was composed, positive, highly industrious. Musset was nonchalant, indifferent,
                    and even neglected his work. </p>
                <p>Things came to a head and a separation between these two characters. Later a
                    desperate attempt by Musset and remorse, but not before he had sunk still deeper
                    into the mire, and in the meantime George Sand had got her affairs in order and
                    was completely absorbed in a new work, and said ‘it’s too late, it’s impossible
                    now’. </p>
                <p>
                    <bad_health>But these are so much questions of inner conflict, and hearts shrink
                        more in pain because of them than appears.</bad_health>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="love">Theo, when I leave I shan’t leave feeling easy about her —
                        on the contrary, uneasy — because I fear so much that she won’t wake up
                        until it’s too late, not have a keen desire for something simpler and purer
                        until the moment for attaining it has passed.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>When I see that sphinxlike quality in her, I recognize it of old both in her and
                    in others, and it’s a very bad sign. Then staring melancholically into the abyss
                    is fatal too, and the way to make that go away is hard work. And now — Theo —
                    she’s again too passively resigned to things — well, melancholy, if it can be
                    overcome, must be overcome by toil, and whoever doesn’t feel that is lost for
                    ever and will go straight to the dogs. I’ve told her this, even got a little of
                    it into her at times. </p>
                <p>You see, she’s on the edge, isn’t she? </p>
                <p>It shan’t be my hand that pushes her in, but nor can I stand beside her forever,
                    holding her back. A person must have enough common sense to cooperate when he is
                    warned and helped.I know, there are cases where the melancholic appears to be
                    unwilling, but later quietly does what he must and recovers. If she’s like that,
                    then that’s fine and she’ll be all right. </p>
                <p>The melancholic is helped by nothing more — in the period of recovery — than by a
                    friend. That’s a great deal then, even if the friend is poor. Well, she’ll
                    continue to find that in me — even if now it’s true that she has been and is at
                    times extremely nasty — of course nonetheless.</p>
                <p>She’ll need a support, and I’ll still be that support even though I am gone,
                    provided I see a little energy and good will. <stress reason="family">The people
                        who tried to turn her away from me (in her family) did something that would
                        be as bad as murdering her and her children if it weren’t that they did it
                        in their obduracy and stupidity.</stress> For without that she’d be much
                    further along. </p>
                <p>Do your best towards the tenth to send me enough for me to be able to leave if
                    need be, because this would be wise. </p>
                <p>All the same, don’t put yourself in difficulties for I’ll act according to the
                    circumstances and write to you straightaway to say what I’ve done. </p>
                <p>If it’s too little for Drenthe I’ll go to Loosduinen for a day or so and wait
                    there. I’ve found splendid things in Loosduinen, old farmhouses, and the effects
                    in the evening are superb there. In that case I would probably send my things
                    ahead or put them in storage. </p>
                <p>But it’s also just the moment at which I can conveniently end the tenancy, and
                    when your letter comes I’ll leave here.</p>
                <p>That will be a sign for the woman that she must persevere. I’ll place more
                    advertisements, but these last two days it was idling about again, and I fear
                    they’ve changed the plan fundamentally.</p>
                <p>Adieu, Theo, I wish things were already sorted out, for days like these are
                    difficult and little good to anyone. I wish you well and good fortune, believe
                    me</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Now that I’ve been here for a few days and have walked around a good deal in
                    different directions, I can tell you more about the region I’ve fetched up
                    in.</p>
                <p>
                    <work origin="new" stage="sketch">I enclose a scratch after my first painted
                        study from this part of the world, a hut on the heath. A hut made of nothing
                        but sods of turf and sticks.</work>
                    <work origin="new" stage="planned">I’ve also seen inside about 6 of this type,
                        and more studies of them will follow.</work>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="environment">I can’t more accurately describe the way the
                        exterior looks in the twilight or just after sunset than by reminding you of
                        a particular painting by Jules Dupré which I think belongs to Mesdag, with
                        two huts in it on which the mossy roofs stand out surprisingly deep in tone
                        against a hazy, dusty evening sky.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>That is here.</p>
                <p>Well, it’s very beautiful inside these huts, dark as a cave. Drawings by certain
                    English artists who have worked on the moors in Ireland most realistically
                    convey what I observe. A. Neuhuys does the same with somewhat more poetry than
                    strikes one at first, but he makes nothing that isn’t also fundamentally
                    true.</p>
                <p>I saw superb figures out in the country — striking in their expression of
                    soberness. A woman’s breast, for example, has that heaving motion that is the
                    exact opposite of voluptuousness, and sometimes, if the creature is old or
                    sickly, arouses compassion or else respect. And the melancholy which things in
                    general have is of a healthy kind, as in Millet’s drawings.Happily, the men here
                    wear breeches; it shows off the shape of the leg, makes the movements more
                    expressive.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="environment">To mention one of the many things that gave me
                        something new to see and to feel during my explorations, I’ll tell you how
                        here one sees, for example, barges pulled by men, women, children, white or
                        black horses, loaded with peat, in the middle of the heath, just like the
                        ones in Holland, on the Trekweg at Rijswijk, for instance.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>The heathland is rich. I saw sheepfolds and shepherds that were more attractive
                    than those in Brabant.</p>
                <p>The ovens are more or less like the ones in T. Rousseau’s Communal oven; stand in
                    the gardens under old apple trees or among the celery and cabbages.</p>
                <p>Beehives, too, in many places.</p>
                <p>One can see that many of the people have something wrong with them — it isn’t
                    exactly healthy here, I think — perhaps because of unclean drinking water. I’ve
                    seen some girls of, I would say, 17 or younger who still had something very
                    beautiful and youthful, in their features too, but generally it fades very
                    early. Yet this doesn’t detract from the fine, noble bearing of the figure that
                    some of them have, who prove to be very withered when seen close to.There are 4
                    or 5 canals in the village, to Meppel, to Dedemsvaart, to Coevorden, to
                    Hollandscheveld.</p>
                <p>If you follow them, you see here and there a curious old mill, farmhouse,
                    shipyard or lock. And always the peat barges coming and going.</p>
                <p>To give you an example of the authentic character of this region: while I was
                    sitting painting that hut, two sheep and a goat came up and started grazing on
                    the roof of the house. The goat climbed onto the ridge and looked down the
                    chimney.</p>
                <p>The woman, who heard something on the roof, shot outside and threw her broom at
                    the said goat, which leapt down like a chamois.</p>
                <p>The two hamlets on the heath where I’ve been and where this incident took place
                    are called Stuifzand and Zwartschaap. I’ve also been in various other places,
                    and now you can imagine how unchanged it still is here, since Hoogeveen is a
                    town after all, and yet nearby there are shepherds, those ovens, those turf huts
                    &amp;c.</p>
                <p>I sometimes think with great melancholy about the woman and the children, if only
                    they were looked after — <stress reason="love">oh, it’s the woman’s own fault,
                        one could say, and it would be true, but I fear that her misfortune will be
                        greater than her guilt. I knew from the outset that her character is a
                        ruined character, but I had hopes of her finding her feet and now, precisely
                        when I don’t see her any more and think about the things I saw in her, I
                        increasingly come to realize that she was already too far gone to find her
                        feet.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <bad_health>And that just makes my feelings of pity even greater, and it’s a
                        melancholy feeling because it isn’t in my power to do anything about
                        it.</bad_health>
                    <stress reason="love">Theo, when I see some poor woman on the heath with a child
                        in her arms or at her breast my eyes become moist. I see her in them; her
                        weakness and slovenliness, too, only serve to intensify the likeness. I know
                        that she isn’t good, that I have every right to do what I’m doing, that to
                        stay with her there wasn’t possible, that bringing her with me really wasn’t
                        possible either, that what I did was even sensible, wise, what you will, but
                        that doesn’t alter the fact that it goes right through me when I see some
                        poor little creature, feverish and miserable, and that then my heart
                        melts</stress>. <bad_health>How much sadness there is in life</bad_health>.
                    Well, one may not become melancholy, one must look elsewhere, and to work is the
                    right thing, only there are moments when one only finds peace in the
                    realization: misfortune won’t spare me either. Adieu, write soon, and believe
                    me</p>

            <salutation>Dear brother,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>I’ve just received your letter and thank you right heartily for it. And want to
                    write to you again straightaway to tell you a few things about my experiences.
                    First of all, I’ve had a letter from Rappard in WestTerschelling and he’s hard
                    at work there, having first spent some time here in Drenthe, in Rolde near
                    Assen.</p>
                <p>
                    <work origin="new" stage="planned">I hope to be able to visit him there myself
                        this winter and to make a few more studies; the trip there, as far as I can
                        make out, there and back, being three guilders, unless the crossing to T.
                        should prove difficult.</work> But it would be worth it to be with a painter
                    again, and will break the isolation.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="friendship">I’m longing to get your next letter, which I hope
                        won’t get stuck in the pen. Don’t forget to tell me the outcome regarding
                        C.M., whether you’ve told him that I was here and whether your letter has
                        also gone unanswered. If that’s the case I’ll certainly go and see C.M., not
                        now of course but later, and ask him to explain why he didn’t reply. I
                        shan’t write, but I’m unshakeably determined that I shall not put up with
                        his not answering, particularly not answering you, and since this is part of
                        it, also his not answering me.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>I’ve NEVER SAID that he must do something, nor do I now. I count what he did or
                    might do as a favour, and as such something for which I’ve always thanked him,
                    and for my part have also given him studies, certainly 50 altogether, with the
                    right to swap them later. And all this being so, I certainly don’t have to
                    tolerate any insults, and it is a gross insult that I haven’t even had word that
                    he received the last packet of studies. Not a syllable. And should your letter
                    remain unanswered on top of this, it would be cowardice to leave it at that, and
                    I must and shall demand an explanation. Which, as said, I shall most certainly
                    do, and in a personal visit, even though some time may elapse. If he isn’t
                    willing to talk to me then, that would by no means finish the matter, because my
                    mind is made up that I shall have satisfaction about it. Should he give it me,
                    well and good, but should he refuse to give it me (I haven’t used a single
                    impolite term to him, I’ve only written in a very cool tone), should, I say, he
                    refuse to give it me, I may say an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, and
                    insult him roundly back, which I would do in cold blood.Make no mistake,
                    brother, understand me in this once and for all, <stress reason="money">however
                        desirable it might be to get financial help</stress> — that is far from
                    being No. 1. <stress reason="friendship">No. 1 is that he goes too far in losing
                        sight of the rights that I have as a human being, even were I a stranger to
                        him (I never speak of our relationship, nor rely on it), not to be treated
                        as a bad lot, not to be condemned or accused of this or that without being
                        able to speak up for myself. I have the right, every right to demand an
                        answer and to consider silence a very gross insult.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>I must speak frankly about this because I had hoped until now that it would come
                    right of its own accord, and that I would receive word in reply.</p>
                <p>But there’s a limit to this silent forbearance and, as I say, beyond that limit
                    it would be cowardly and unmanly of me not to protest foursquare against it. So
                    I ask you kindly, simply to tell me what has happened as regards an answer to
                    your letter; then I’ll know for myself what I must do, then I won’t say another
                    word about it, but even if more than a year were to pass I’ll still find deep
                    inside me, as untarnished, clear and bright as I have at this moment, this same
                    feeling that I must have an explanation, and not rest until I’ve settled matters
                    with him one way or another.</p>
                <p>I think that you’ll appreciate my feelings, and would do so all the more if you
                    knew precisely what occurred between him and me in years past. When I was very
                    dubious about the plan to study, whether the promise to bring that about was
                    straightforward and wellconsidered — I thought then that they made the plan too
                    hastily and I went along with it too hastily, and in my view it remains an
                    excellent thing that it stopped when it did, which I deliberately brought about
                    myself, contriving it such that the shame of giving up fell on me and not on
                    anyone else. <stress reason="career">You know that I, who have learned other
                        languages, could have managed to master that miserable little bit of Latin
                        &amp;c., but I said I couldn’t cope. This was an excuse, because I didn’t
                        want to tell my protectors that I regard the whole University (or at least
                        the Theology Faculty) as an unspeakable mess, a breedingground for
                        Pharisees.I tried to prove that I didn’t lack courage by going to the
                        Borinage, where life was most certainly much harder for me than it would
                        have been had I become a student.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="friendship">I thought that C.M., for example, might have
                        understood me better, and have all the more reason to believe him
                        insensitive when I think how he has treated me with a degree of contempt
                        ever since. </stress>Then and now I’ve kept to myself a good many things
                    that I could have said, and if I ever tackle him about them he’ll have to feel a
                    thing or two in his conscience, whatever he may say; how I, neither in the past
                    nor now, have ever committed any base acts against him, so there’s no
                    conceivable reason for this insult of his failure to reply, all the more so
                    since it would have been better if, from the moment when I went to The Hague,
                    all that was in the past had been forgiven and forgotten and we’d resolved to
                    maintain cordial relations, which I discussed with His Hon. at the time. But I
                    do not say, brother, peace at any price, and I would rather have an unpleasant
                    explanation than weakly let things go when doing so would be weak, and it would
                    be now.</p>
                <p>Be assured, though, that I shall NOT mention you, even though his insult to you,
                    if he doesn’t set it right (it occurs to me that he’s beginning to use something
                    of the same policy towards you) is what’s making me resolved to have it out with
                    His Hon., and I’ve decided to say a great many things to him.</p>
                <p>I promise you that, I’ll make it appear as if I was talking about myself alone,
                    as if I knew nothing about you.</p>
                <p>I have the very deepest contempt for this mysterious, sphinxlike silence &amp;c.,
                    and I tell you here and now that I think all sorts of things about it, except
                    for something that’s straightforward and honest or true.</p>
                <p>It may have something to do with the general politics of the day, I know that,
                    but as you know I don’t agree with the general politics of the day because I
                    regard it as base and bearing all the traits of a decline that will end in a new
                    periwig age.One could weep about what’s presently being spoiled in all sorts of
                    areas, things to which our predecessors devoted their labours, honestly, are now
                    being meanspiritedly neglected and abandoned. The times we live in are perhaps
                    outwardly a little more respectable than earlier days, but too much nobleness is
                    being lost for us to be able to expect the same great things of the future that
                    there have been in the past. Well, everyone has to make up his own mind.</p>
                <p>Now to change the subject — but it was necessary to deal with these matters,
                    although I take not the slightest pleasure in writing about them — namely my
                    experiences here. <unstress reason="environment">The more I walk around the
                        area, the more I’m coming to like Hoogeveen itself, and I don’t doubt that
                        this will remain so</unstress>. If C.M. falls through, which I fear, this
                    doesn’t alter the fact that in the long run it will work out cheaper here than
                    in The Hague. But because of C.M. falling through I’ll have to scrimp and save
                    for a while before I can carry out my plans. And perhaps we’ll lose absolutely
                    nothing by it after all.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="money">The fact is that I do need money and a stock of paint and
                        various things before I can expect any results from the trip through the
                        southeast corner of Drenthe.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>But in six months or so I hope I’ll have saved enough, and in the meantime I’ll
                    still be able to do things here. So for the present I won’t go further away for
                    good, but will stay and work in this area. Will try to save some money for two
                    trips, one through the southeast corner, one across the heath between here and
                    Assen. <unstress reason="friendship">And I hope to combine the latter trip to
                        the north with a visit to friend Rappard and spend some time in his lodgings
                        on Terschelling, known as ’t Scheepje</unstress>. It would be too reckless
                    to go on these two trips if one were to undertake them without supplies and
                    without being prepared for the circumstances. <unstress reason="money">But with
                        patience they’re possible, for I see well enough that I have fewer expenses
                        here than in The Hague.</unstress> And before I begin on that I’d like to
                    pay Rappard his money back, although it may be that later I’ll perhaps borrow
                    something from him again after I’ve seen him, and if I know for sure that I can
                    make something specific with it.<stress reason="career">At first I had some
                        trouble here with models on the heath, where people laughed about it and I
                        was ridiculed and couldn’t finish figure studies that I’d started because of
                        the unwillingness of the models, although I had paid them well, at least for
                        these parts.</stress>
                    <unstress reason="career">I stood firm, though, and concentrated on a single
                        family in that same place, where I can now get an old woman, a girl and a
                        man, and have hopes that they’ll remain willing.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <work mention="vague">I have a few studies of the heath, which I’ll send you
                        when they’re thoroughly dry, and have also begun watercolours.</work>
                    <work mention="vague">And I’ve also started pen drawings again, specifically
                        with a view to painting, because one can go into such details with the pen
                        as painted studies cannot do, and one does well to make two studies, one
                        entirely drawn for the way things are put together, and one painted for the
                        colour.</work> If this can be done, that is, and the occasion permits, this
                    is a way of working up the painted study later. </p>
                <p>The heath is rich, and there are marshy meadows that often remind me of T.
                    Rousseau. W<good_health>ell, I can tell you that the open air and the life here
                        are really doing me good.</good_health>
                    <stress reason="love">Oh if only the poor woman could have had it — I think of
                        her with such profound sadness — although my common sense tells me quite
                        clearly that it’s impossible now in the circumstances. I’m worried about her
                        because I heard nothing from her, and from that assume that she has been
                        either unwilling or unable to do things that I advised her to do. I can’t
                        even write to her easily, because if she continues to live in Bagijnestraat
                        I know first that my letter will be opened, probably by her brother or her
                        mother, and secondly as long as she lives there I don’t want to have
                        anything to do with it anyway, not even with her. Still, perhaps I’ll hear
                        something yet, but my thoughts will be gloomy if I hear nothing further. I
                        had hoped to get a message from an address other than Bagijnestraat, and
                        that she and her mother had started a little business doing laundry and
                        ironing.Oh Theo, if she hadn’t had any family she’d have behaved herself so
                        much better. Women like her really are bad, but first infinitely, I say
                        infinitely, more pitiable than bad, and secondly they have a certain
                        passion, certain warmth which has something so very human that the
                        respectable could learn a lesson, and I for my part understand the words of
                        Jesus, who said to the superficially civilized, the respectable people of
                        His time, ‘the harlots go BEFORE you’. Women like her, they can be fatally
                        bad (I’m not even speaking here of the Nanas, fullblooded and sensual, but
                        of the more nervous, rational temperaments among them), women like her, they
                        fully justify Proudhon’s words, woman is the desolation of the righteous man
                        — they don’t care about what we call ‘reason’ and go against it directly and
                        culpably, I know that, but on the other hand they still have that genuine
                        humanity, which means that one may not and cannot do without them, and one
                        feels that there’s good in them and even something almighty good, even
                        though one can’t define it other than ‘I don’t know what makes one love them
                        after all’. Gavarni was serious when he said: I felt something die within me
                        with every woman that I have left. And the most beautiful saying and the
                        best that I know on the question of women is the one that you know too, oh
                        woman whom I could have loved, and one would willingly go into the infinite
                        with that, wanting nothing more than that knowledge. </stress>
                </p>
                <p>I know that there are women, absurdly enough (they indeed do even more harm to it
                    than the men), who are wholly governed by ambition etc. — Lady Macbeth is this
                    type — these women are fatal, and one must avoid them despite their charm or one
                    becomes a villain and very soon finds oneself faced with terrible evil that one
                    has done and can never put right again — but there was nothing like this in her
                    with whom I was, although she was vain, just as we all are at times. Poor, poor,
                    poor creature is all that I felt at the start and I still feel in the end. Bad?
                    So be it, but who in our times is good? Who feels so pure that he wants to play
                    judge? God forbid. Delacroix would have understood her, I dare say, and God’s
                    misericorde will even, I sometimes think, understand her much more, surely.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="friendship">As I wrote to you, the little lad loved me very
                        much, and when I was already sitting in the wagon I still had him on my lap.
                        And so we parted, I believe with inexpressible melancholy on both sides, but
                        nothing more.</stress>I tell you brother, I’m not good in the way of the
                    ministers, I too, not to mince words, think whores are bad, but I nevertheless
                    feel something human in them that means I don’t have the slightest scruple about
                    consorting with them, I see nothing particularly evil in them, I haven’t the
                    slightest remorse about the acquaintance I have or have had with them. If our
                    society were a pure and ordered one, oh yes, then they were temptresses, now —
                    many times it seems to me they should be regarded more as sisters of charity
                    than anything else.</p>
                <p>And now, as in other periods of the fall of a civilization, the relationships of
                    good and evil are often reversed because of the corruption of society, and one
                    reasonably comes back to the old saying: ‘the first shall be last and the last
                    shall be first’.</p>
                <p>Like you, I’ve been to Père Lachaise, I’ve seen the graves of men for whom I have
                    indescribable respect; I felt the same respect by the humble little tombstone of
                    Béranger’s mistress, which I visited expressly (if I remember rightly it’s in a
                    little corner behind his), and I also thought there about Corot’s mistress in
                    particular. Such women were silent muses, and I forever, always and everywhere
                    feel the influence of a feminine element in the emotion of these gentle masters,
                    the intimacy, the penetration of their poetry. I’m speaking a bit seriously in
                    this letter, not because I think that Pa’s feelings and views, for instance, are
                    wrong in everything — far from it — you would, for example, do well to follow
                    Pa’s advice in many things — we talked about Pa, you will recall, during your
                    visit and at the moment you left — but something that I felt vaguely then I can
                    now express more clearly, when you speak with Pa, think at the same time of
                    Corot, say, you’ll then automatically avoid some of the extremes into which Pa
                    lapses much too much, and as I see it, on this condition that there’s less
                    stiffness, Pa’s advice is usually good, and I have myself paid heed to it many
                        times.<stress reason="family"> But I point out that Pa and others do not
                        know that besides their upright lives — for Pa’s life is upright — there are
                        other upright lives, more in a milder spirit, in the character of Corot,
                        Béranger, shall I say. You and I also feel that much more in any event.
                        Because Pa and others DO not KNOW THAT, they are frequently and fatally
                        mistaken when judging certain matters.</stress> Mistakes along the lines,
                    for example, that C.M. certainly believes that Degroux was a bad man, in which,
                    however sure he is in his belief, he is nonetheless mistaken. I’ll now tell you
                    something else to make it clear to you that I’m not speaking in the abstract but
                    about things that have solidity and substance. <unstress reason="friendship">If
                        you want an example of someone who originally had the ordinary, good Dutch
                        character and feelings and yet has changed those feelings since, yet has
                        reconsidered, and I think will change even more. Then as an example I give
                        you Rappard, who is now already much gentler and more humane than when I
                        first got to know him, and in my view is much improved, even though he was
                        already good before.</unstress> Although, I fear, not everyone sees it this
                    way, and he has already had some conflict about it. In the past he really was
                    good, but yet he became dissatisfied with that and is now deeper and more humane
                    than he was then. It doesn’t make things easier for him — he used to have far
                    less conflict — I know that for certain — because at the time I jokingly called
                    him ‘the clear conscience’ and teased him about it, which I definitely no longer
                    do, because I see that there has been a revolution in him. He’s a little less
                    elegant and he’s much less superficial as a person, and a certain germ of genius
                    has begun its development, and he has steered clear of the pitfall of
                    ‘withering’.</p>
                <p>In respect of people who genuinely seek good, I think what Hugo says is true,
                    ‘there is the BLACK ray and there is the WHITE ray’.</p>
                <p>In my view Pa has more the black ray and Corot has more the white ray, but both
                    of them have a ray from on high.</p>
                <p>So I don’t call anyone whom we’ve discussed bad, NO, for all that, but I do say
                    that the black ray has a fatal side, and because I’ve since thought about what
                    you said to me on the station platform when you left, I tell you now in
                    explanation of what I couldn’t readily find words for then, ‘I know that Pa is
                    Pa, but there’s something else besides that, namely what we’ll call “the white
                    ray”’. And I find more that’s positive, more true peace in that, and I’ve fixed
                    my attention on it much more. As to Millet, he’s the man above all others who
                    had the white ray. Millet has a gospel, and I ask you whether there’s a
                    distinction between a drawing by him and a good sermon. It makes the sermon
                    black, it’s the outcome of the comparison, even if it (the sermon, that is) is
                    fine in itself, assuming that it is. I know that you too have a lot of strife at
                    the moment, although I don’t know precisely the ins and outs of it. And in any
                    event it’s out of sympathy that I tell you precisely what I think about a few
                    things, because I’ve also had and still have a lot of strife.</p>
                <p>And I wish you more and more of the white ray, you hear! Thanks for what you
                    sent, and a handshake in thought.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>
                    <work mention="vague">Today I’m sending a package of 3 studies which I hope are
                        dry enough.</work> However, if they stick to the sheet of paper I laid on
                    them as a precaution, soak them off with lukewarm water. The smallest one, in
                    particular, has sunk in a lot, go over it with the white of an egg in about a
                    week, or some varnish in a month’s time, to lift them. I’m sending them to let
                    you take a look, and better after this — really.</p>
                <p>I forgot to reply to what you write about sending the you know what. For the time
                    being would you send a postal order like the last, until I know of an exchange
                    office — deduct expenses, though. </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="family">Received a letter from home that Pa had been unwell as a
                        result of a fall — I hope it isn’t more serious than they say.</stress> Do
                    you know anything more about it?</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="environment">Went further into the peat fields last week —
                        marvellous scenes, the longer I stay here the more beautiful I find it, and
                        from the outset I’ll try to stay here in this region.</unstress>
                    <unstress reason="career">For it’s so beautiful here that at the same time a
                        great deal of study is needed to capture it, and only solid work can give a
                        truer understanding of things as they are at bottom, and of their serious,
                        sober nature.</unstress> I came across superb figures — but again, a nature
                    that has so much nobility, so much dignity and gravity must be treated with
                    maturity and patience and prolonged work. This is why, in my view, from the
                    outset I mustn’t regard it as just coming to take a look around here, but it’s
                    in the nature of the thing, if all goes well and we’re granted a little good
                    fortune, that I’ll stay for good. Write again soon, won’t you — <bad_health>I’m
                        longing to hear, for despite all the beauty outside I still feel
                        dejected.</bad_health> Adieu, with a handshake.</p>

            <salutation>Dear brother,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>
                    <bad_health>Because I have a need to speak frankly, I can’t hide from you that
                        I’m overcome by a feeling of great anxiety, dejection, a je ne sais quoi of
                        discouragement and even despair, too much to express. And that if I can find
                        no consolation for it, it might all too easily overwhelm me
                        unbearably.</bad_health>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="friendship">It really bothers me that I have so little success
                        with people in general, I’m very concerned about this, and all the more so
                        because rising above it and getting on with the work is at stake
                        here.</stress>
                    <stress reason="love">The fate of the woman, moreover, the fate of my sweet,
                        poor little lad and the other child, cut me to the quick. I’d still like to
                        help and I can’t.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <bad_health>I’m at a point where I need credit, trust and some warmth, and you
                        see there’s no trust in me. You’re an exception to this, but precisely
                        because everything falls on you it makes it even more apparent how dismal
                        everything is in my case.</bad_health>
                </p>
                <p>And if I look at my things, they’re too poor, too inadequate, too much exhausted.
                        <stress reason="environment">We’re having gloomy, rainy days here, and when
                        I come into the corner of the attic where I’ve installed myself it’s all
                        remarkably melancholy there — with the light from one single glass roof tile
                        that falls on an empty painting box, on a bundle of brushes with few decent
                        bristles remaining, well it’s so curiously melancholy that luckily it also
                        has a funny enough side not to weep over it but to regard it more
                        cheerfully.</stress> But even so, it’s in a very strange relationship to my
                    plans — in a very strange relationship to the seriousness of the work, and —
                    this is where the laughing stops.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="money">What else can I do? — last year ended with an even bigger
                        deficit than I told you, for I’ve already paid off more than I mentioned to
                        you, including Rappard,</stress> and <stress reason="friendship">still
                        however owe Rappard above all, and that worries me the most because he’s a
                        friend,</stress> and although at this moment I’ve paid off everything that
                    was in the slightest bit urgent I’m faced with the problem that I still have to
                    pay for other things before the paint that I would otherwise buy, or rather I
                    don’t dare take it on credit, which would again cause me a considerable bill in
                    time. You know yourself how we weren’t exactly in the mood to be able to say
                    more during your visit, but I tell you now that The Hague has been too much for
                    me, and I had already put off and put off the separation for one particular
                    specific reason, even though the deficit was inevitable if I persisted. <stress
                        reason="love">This was that, rather than separating, I would have risked one
                        more attempt by marrying her and going to live with her in the country,
                        although not without telling you how things stood. But I believed one thing,
                        that this was the right course, even despite the temporary financial
                        drawbacks, and that not only could it have been her salvation but would also
                        have put an end to great inner struggle for me, which has now, unhappily,
                        doubled for me. And I would rather have seen it through to the bitter
                        end.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="family">If either Pa or you had been able to feel it thus,
                        perhaps — I don’t say that I would have been happier or unhappier as a
                        result, and if the roles had been reversed, you in my place, I in yours, I
                        don’t know whether I would have been able to act other than as you did — but
                        perhaps, I say, she would have been saved because of it.</stress> I
                    therefore regard it as something where the decision depended not on you two, but
                    on myself (except that I can’t give myself my father’s consent to marry, this
                    single point is beyond me, and in response to a determined question Pa answered
                    me in generalities in which, however, there was no hint of consent), and so I
                    decided, because I already had debts and the future was dark. <bad_health>But
                        this decision is not yet a renewal, and doesn’t take away the exhaustion
                        that a year of too many cares brings in its train, while I’m also left with
                        a wounded heart and a feeling of emptiness and disappointment and melancholy
                        — not so easy to cure.</bad_health>
                    <unstress reason="money">I may be here now, and may almost have covered the
                        financial deficit, and in a while it could be entirely covered,</unstress>
                    <unstress reason="environment">and nature is wonderful here and exceeds my
                        expectations.</unstress>
                    <bad_health>Yet I’m far from being comfortably settled again and getting on,
                        because the little glimpse of my attic I’m giving you is drawn from
                        life.</bad_health>
                </p>
                <p>If I’d known all these things in advance, I would have moved here with the woman
                    last year when she came out of hospital, then there would have been no deficit
                    and then we wouldn’t be separated now, for she’s less guilty of her wrongdoing
                    than her family, who have intrigued very meanly, ostensibly for her but
                    fundamentally against her. Meanwhile, I’ve sometimes wondered, for instance,
                    whether the mother wasn’t also being backed in turn by a priest, because too
                    much has been done on their part to influence the woman for me to explain.
                        <stress reason="love">All the more so because I’ve still heard nothing from
                        her, although before I left I told her that I would give the carpenter next
                        door my address as soon as I knew it myself; I sent it to him and asked him
                        to tell her, and I’ve still heard nothing, except just from this carpenter
                        that she’s collected all her things (more than she brought with her, after
                        all).</stress> Now you understand that I’m concerned about her fate,
                    although I believe that if she were simply in need she’d have written, but now
                    there must be something wrong behind it. You will understand my feeling about
                    it, I rather fear that the family is saying to her: he’ll surely write and
                    then... we’ll have him under our thumb — in short they’re presuming on my
                    weakness and I am not going to walk into that trap. And today I’m writing not to
                    her but to the carpenter to tell him that he must make sure she knows my
                    address, but I will not write to her first, and if she writes will see how
                    things actually stand. When I would definitely try to help is if her family were
                    to cast her off entirely, and if it’s the case that her family is helping her, I
                    understand well enough that she’s too much in agreement with them, and has been
                    for a long time, so that I may not or cannot have anything more to do with it.
                    Or, I’ve thought, if there’s a priest behind it, she’s being helped but only on
                    condition that she has nothing more to do with me, and that’s the reason for her
                    silence.</p>
                <p>But I’ll say that I haven’t yet got so far that I can resign myself to the idea
                    of separation, at present I’m still very, very concerned about her fate,
                    precisely because she’s leaving me in the dark about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <bad_health>And over and above all this, I’ve been overwhelmed these past few
                        days by sombre feelings about the future, and also about the miserable state
                        of my equipment as far as painting materials are concerned, the
                        impossibility of doing the most essential, most useful things as they really
                        should be done.</bad_health>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="environment">Since I can already see straightaway that there’s
                        so much beauty here,</unstress> if I could afford it I would send for my
                    things that are still there in The Hague, and I would either fit up this same
                    attic here as a studio (by letting a bit more light in) or look for another
                    place. And then I’d like to renew and replenish all my equipment. I wish that
                    for once I could do this really thoroughly, and if I could find someone who
                    would trust me that far, my greatest concerns would be allayed. <stress
                        reason="money">But either everything falls on you or I find no one who
                        trusts me, this is the circle in which my thoughts revolve, and I see no way
                        out.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>A painter who has no means of his own can’t get by without sometimes rather large
                    credit with people, credit that not only the profession of painter requires, but
                    that the professions of cobbler, carpenter, smith would equally require, I
                    believe no more nor less, if they had to set themselves up or reestablish
                    themselves somewhere. <stress reason="environment">It’s above all in this rainy
                        weather, of which we have months ahead of us, that my hands are really
                        tied.</stress> And then, what else can I do? <bad_health>— sometimes my
                        thoughts take on a form — I’ve worked and economized and still not been able
                        to avoid debt, I’ve been faithful to the woman and yet lapsed into
                        disloyalty, I’ve abhorred intrigues and yet I have virtually no credit or
                        possessions. I don’t regard your trust in me lightly, on the contrary, but I
                        rather wonder whether I shouldn’t say to you, forget about me for we won’t
                        get there — it’s too much for one, and there’s no chance of getting any
                        relief from another quarter — is this not proof enough that we should give
                        up?</bad_health>
                </p>
                <p>Oh, old chap, I’ve become so melancholy — <unstress reason="environment">I’m in
                        magnificent countryside,</unstress>
                    <stress reason="career">I have a desire, indeed an absolute need to work — at
                        the same time I’m absolutely at a loss as to how we’re going to get on top
                        of it, when I think that my things are in the most miserable state and I’m
                        here without a studio or anything, and will be embarrassed everywhere until
                        I can improve matters. The models — they refuse to pose if there are
                        bystanders around, and this is the greatest difficulty that makes a studio
                        desirable.</stress> I have the same feeling now as I did when I set up the
                    studio in The Hague — ‘if I don’t do it, I’ll certainly not be able to manage’.
                    And even now, given The Hague, I don’t regret that I did as I did in those
                    circumstances, only I wish I had come here 1 1/2 years earlier and set up a
                    studio here instead of there.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="family">Pa wrote to me saying that he wanted to help me, but I
                        didn’t let him know anything about my worries, and I hope that you won’t say
                        anything to Pa on this subject either. Pa has his own worries, and would
                        only have even more worries were he to find out that things aren’t going
                        well.</stress> So I merely wrote to Pa that everything turned out much
                    better than I expected, which is also perfectly true as far as nature is
                    concerned. As long as the weather was good I wasn’t aware of things because I
                    saw so much that was beautiful, but now that it’s been pouring with rain
                    incessantly for several days I increasingly see how I’m actually stuck here, and
                    I’m embarrassed. What’s to be done? Will things worsen or improve with time? I
                    don’t know, but I feel really miserable and can’t shake it off.In every life
                    some rain must fall</p>
                <p>And days be dark and drearythat is true, it cannot be otherwise, yet I wonder if
                    the number of dark and dreary days can’t sometimes get too great? Nevertheless,
                    I’ve had a model again in the barn, but in very trying light. After all, I don’t
                    refuse to do what can be done, but can I do what MUST be done in the
                    circumstances? And this letter is a sigh for space, and if the winter has to be
                    like these days, I would be in a bad way. It’s beautiful, though, indeed
                    extremely beautiful in the rain, but how does one work, how when one lacks too
                    much? Adieu, old chap, I wish everything would turn out all right, but we need
                    more trust from other people, otherwise I fear it won’t work. I hope to hear
                    from you soon. <work mention="vague">Did you receive studies?</work>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>This time I’m writing to you from the very back of beyond in Drenthe, where I
                    arrived after an endless trip through the heath on the barge.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="environment">I see no way of describing the countryside to you
                        as it should be done, because words fail me. But imagine the banks of the
                        canal as miles and miles of Michels or T. Rousseaus, say, Van Goyens or P.
                        de Koninck.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>Flat planes or strips differing in colour, which grow narrower and narrower as
                    they approach the horizon. Accentuated here and there by a sod hut or small farm
                    or a few scrawny birches, poplars, oaks. Stacks of peat everywhere, and always
                    barges sailing past with peat or bulrushes from the marshes. Here and there thin
                    cows of a delicate colour, often sheep — pigs. The figures that now and then
                    appear on the plain usually have great character, sometimes they’re really
                    charming. <work origin="new" stage="sketch">I drew, among others, a woman in the
                        barge with crepe around her cap brooches because she was in mourning,</work>
                    <work origin="new" stage="sketch">and later a mother with a small child — this
                        one had a purple scarf around her head.</work>
                </p>
                <p>There are a lot of Ostade types among them, physiognomies that remind one of pigs
                    or crows, but every so often there’s a little figure that’s like a lily among
                    the thorns. <good_health>In short, I’m very pleased about this trip, for I’m
                        full of what I’ve seen.</good_health>
                    <unstress reason="environment">The heath was extraordinarily beautiful this
                        evening.</unstress> There’s a Daubigny in one of the Albums Boetzel that
                    expresses that effect precisely. The sky was an inexpressibly delicate lilac
                    white — not fleecy clouds, because they were more joined together and covered
                    the whole sky, but tufts in tints more or less of lilac — grey — white — a
                    single small rent through which the blue gleamed. Then on the horizon a
                    sparkling red streak — beneath it the surprisingly dark expanse of brown heath,
                    and a multitude of low roofs of small huts standing out against the glowing red
                    streak. In the evening this heath often has effects that the English would
                    describe as weird and quaint. The spiky silhouettes of Don Quixotelike mills or
                    strange hulks of drawbridges are profiled against the teeming evening sky. In
                    the evening a village like that is sometimes really snug, with the light from
                    the little windows reflected in the water or in mud and puddles.</p>
                <p>
                    <work mention="vague">Before I left Hoogeveen I painted a few more studies
                        there, among them a large farmhouse with a mossy roof.</work>
                    <good_health>For I’d had paint sent from Furnée’s, because I thought the same
                        about it as you say in your letter, that by making sure I become absorbed in
                        the work and lose myself in it so to speak, my mood would change, and indeed
                        it’s already a good deal better.</good_health>
                </p>
                <p>But at times — like those moments when you think about going to America I think
                    about going to the East as a volunteer. <bad_health>But they’re those wretched,
                        sombre moments when things overwhelm one,</bad_health>
                    <unstress reason="environment">and I would wish that you might see the silent
                        heath that I see through the window here, because such a thing soothes one
                        and inspires more faith, resignation, calm work.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <work mention="vague">I drew several studies in the barge,</work> but I’m
                    staying here to paint. I’m close to Zweeloo here, where Liebermann, among
                    others, has been, and besides there’s an area here where there are large, very
                    old sod huts where there isn’t even a partition between the barn and the living
                    room. My plan for these first days is to visit that region.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="environment">But what tranquillity, what breadth, what calm
                        there is in nature here, one doesn’t feel it until one has miles and miles
                        of Michels between oneself and the everyday.</unstress> I can’t give you a
                    definite address at the moment because I don’t know exactly where I’ll be for
                    the next few days, but I’ll be in HOOGEVEEN on 12 October, and if you send your
                    letter at the usual time to the same address I’ll find it there in Hoogeveen on
                    the twelfth. The place where I am now is NieuwAmsterdam.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="money">I received a postal order for 10 guilders from Pa,
                        which with what I got from you means that I can now do some
                        painting.</unstress> I’m thinking of returning to this inn where I am now
                    for a long stay if I can reach the area with the large old sod huts easily from
                    here, since I would have better light and space here. For as to that painting by
                    that Englishman with the thin cat and the little coffin, although the idea first
                    came to him in that dark room, he would have found it very difficult to paint in
                    that same place, at least one usually works too light if one sits in a room
                    that’s too dark, so that when one brings it into the light one sees that all the
                    shadows are too weak. <work mention="vague">I experienced this only recently,
                        when I painted an open door and the view through into the little garden from
                        inside the barn.</work>
                </p>
                <p>Well, I just wanted to tell you that I’ll also be able to overcome this drawback,
                    because I could get a room here with good light and where a stove can stand in
                    the winter. Now, old chap, if you think no more about America, and I no more
                    about Harderwijk, then I hope things will work themselves out. I admit that your
                    explanation of C.M.’s silence might be the case, but sometimes nonchalance can
                    also be deliberate.</p>
                <p>You’ll find a few croquis on the back. I write in haste, or rather it’s already
                    late.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="family">How I wish that we could walk together here and — paint
                        together.</stress> I believe that the countryside would win you over and
                    convince you. Adieu, I hope that you’re well and will have a bit of good
                    fortune. I thought about you again and again on this trip. With a handshake.</p>

            <salutation>Dear brother,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>I just received your letter. I read and reread it with interest, and something
                    that I’ve already thought about sometimes, without knowing what to do about it,
                    is becoming clear to me. It’s that you and I have in common a time of quietly
                    drawing impossible windmills &amp;c., where the drawings are in a singular
                    rapport with the storm of thoughts and aspirations — in vain, because no one who
                    can shed light is concerned about them (only a painter would then be able to
                    help one along the right path, and their thoughts are elsewhere).<stress
                        reason="family"> This is a great inner struggle, and it ends in
                        discouragement or in throwing those thoughts overboard as impractical, and
                        precisely when one is 20 or so, one is passionate to do that. Whatever the
                        truth of the matter that I said something then that unwittingly contributed
                        to throwing those things overboard; at that moment my thoughts were perhaps
                        the same as yours, that’s to say that I saw it as something impossible, but
                        as regards that desperate struggle without seeing any light, I know it too,
                        how awful it is. With all one’s energy one can do nothing and thinks oneself
                        mad, and I don’t know what else.</stress>
                    <stress reason="career">When I was in London, how often I would stand on the
                        Thames Embankment and draw as I made my way home from Southampton Street in
                        the evening, and it looked terrible. If only there had been someone then who
                        had told me what perspective was, how much misery I would have been spared,
                        how much further along I would be now. Well, fait accompli is fait accompli.
                        It didn’t happen then — I did talk to Thijs Maris occasionally (I didn’t
                        dare speak to Boughton, because I felt such great respect in his presence)
                        but I didn’t find it there either, that helping me with the first things,
                        with the ABC.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="family">Let me now repeat that I believe in you as an artist,
                        and that you can still become one, indeed that you should very soon think
                        calmly about whether you are one or not, whether you would be able to
                        produce something or not if you learned to spell the aforementioned ABC, and
                        then also spent some time walking through the wheatfield and the heath, in
                        order to renew once more what you yourself say, ‘I used to be part of that
                        nature, now I don’t feel that any more’.</stress>
                    <bad_health>Let me tell you, brother, that I myself have felt so deeply, deeply
                        that which you say there. That I’ve had a time of nervous, barren stress
                        when I had days when I couldn’t find the most beautiful countryside
                        beautiful, precisely because I didn’t feel myself part of it. That’s what
                        pavements and the office — and care — and nerves — do.</bad_health>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="family">Don’t take it amiss if I say now that your soul is sick
                        at this moment — it really is — it isn’t good that you aren’t part of nature
                        — and I think that No. 1 now is for you to make that normal again. I think
                        it’s very good that you yourself feel the difference between your state of
                        mind now and in other years. And don’t doubt that you will agree with me
                        that you must work on it to put it right.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <bad_health>I now have to look back into my own past to see what the matter was,
                        spending years in that stony, barren state of mind and trying to emerge from
                        it, and yet it got worse and worse instead of better. Not only did I feel
                        indifferent instead of responsive to nature but also, which was much worse,
                        I felt exactly the same about people.People said that I was going mad; I
                        myself felt that I wasn’t, if only because I felt my own malady very deep
                        inside myself and tried to get over it again. I made all sorts of forlorn
                        attempts that led to nothing, so be it,</bad_health>
                    <good_health>but because of that idée fixe of getting back to a normal position
                        I never confused my own desperate doings, scrambling and squirmings with I
                        myself. At least I always felt ‘let me just do something, be somewhere, it
                        must get better, I’ll get over it, let me have the patience to
                        recover’.</good_health>
                </p>
                <p>I don’t believe that someone like Boks, for instance, who really turned out to be
                    mad, thought like that — so I say again, I’ve thought about it a lot since,
                    about my years of all sorts of scrambling, and I don’t see that, given my
                    circumstances, I could be other than I have been.</p>
                <p>Here is the ground that sank beneath my feet — here is the ground which, if it
                    sinks, must make a person miserable, whoever he may be. <stress reason="career"
                        >I was with G&amp;Cie for 6 years — I had put down roots in G&amp;Cie and I
                        thought that, although I left, I could look back on 6 years of good work,
                        and that if I presented myself somewhere I could refer to my past with
                        equanimity.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>But by no means; things are done so hurriedly that little consideration is given,
                    little is questioned or reasoned. People act on the most random, most
                    superficial impressions. And once one is out of G&amp;Cie no one knows who
                    G&amp;Cie is. It’s a name like X&amp;Co., without meaning — and so one is simply
                    ‘a person without a situation’. All at once — suddenly — fatally — everywhere —
                    there you have it. Of course, precisely because one has a certain respectability
                    one doesn’t say I’m soandso, I’m this or that. One presents oneself for a new
                    situation serious in all respects, without saying much, with a view to putting
                    one’s hand to the plough. Very well, but then, that ‘person without a
                    situation’, the man from anywhere, gradually becomes suspect. Suppose that your
                    new employer is a man whose affairs are very mysterious, and suppose that he has
                    just one goal, ‘money’. With all your energy, can you really immediately, at
                    once, help him a very great deal in that? Perhaps not, eh? And yet he wants
                    money, money come what may; you want to know something more about the business,
                    and what you see or hear is pretty disgusting.</p>
                <p>And soon it’s: ‘someone without a situation’, I don’t need you any more. See, now
                    that’s what you increasingly become: someone without a situation. Go to England,
                    go to America, it doesn’t help at all, you’re an uprooted tree everywhere.
                    G&amp;Cie, where your roots are from an early age — G&amp;Cie, although
                    indirectly they cause you this misery because in your youth you regarded them as
                    the finest, the best, the biggest in the world — G&amp;Cie, were you to return
                    to them — I didn’t do that then — I couldn’t — my heart was too full, much too
                    full — G&amp;Cie, they’d give you the cold shoulder, say it was no longer their
                    concern or something. With all this one has been uprooted, and the world turns
                    it around and says that you’ve uprooted yourself. Fact — your place no longer
                    acknowledges you. I felt too melancholy to do anything about it — and I don’t
                    remember ever having been in the mood to talk to someone about it as I’m talking
                    to you now. <stress reason="family">Because, and actually to my surprise, for I
                        thought that even if they did it to me they would, however, certainly not
                        have dared to do it to you, I read in your letter the words ‘when I spoke to
                        them this week the gentlemen made it almost impossible for me’.</stress> Old
                    chap, you know how it is with me, but if you’re miserable about one thing and
                    another, do not feel you are alone. It’s too much to bear alone, and to some
                    extent I can sympathize with you the way it is. Now, stand your ground and don’t
                    let your pain throw you off balance — if the gentlemen behave like this, stand
                    on your dignity and don’t accept your dismissal except on terms that guarantee
                    you’ll get a new situation. They aren’t worth your losing your temper, don’t do
                    that, even if they provoke you. I lost my temper and walked straight out. Now in
                    my position it was different again from yours; I was one of the least, you are
                    one of the first, but what I say about being uprooted, I’m afraid that you would
                    feel the same if you were out of it, so look at that, too, coldbloodedly, stand
                    up to them and don’t let them push you out without being a little prepared for
                    that difficult situation of beginning again. And know this — given an uprooting,
                    given not making headway again, don’t despair.</p>
                <p>Then, in the worst case, do NOT go to America, because it’s exactly the same
                    there as in Paris. No, beware of reaching that point where one says: I’ll make
                    myself scarce; I had that myself, I hope that you won’t have it. If you had it,
                    I say again, beware of it, resist it with great coolness, say to yourself, this
                    point proves to me that I’m running into a brick wall. This is a wall for bulls
                    to run into; I am a bull too, but an intelligent one, I am a bull about becoming
                    an artist. Anyway, get out before you smash your head to pieces, that’s all. I’m
                    not saying that that’s what will happen; I hope that there will be no question
                    whatever of running into a wall. But suppose after all that there was a
                    whirlpool with accompanying sharpedged rocky promontories, well, I would just
                    think that you might avoid it, wouldn’t you? Perhaps you’ll admit that those
                    rocks might be there, since you yourself pulled me out of that whirlpool when I
                    had no more hope of getting out of it and was powerless to fight against it any
                    more.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="family">I mean, give those waters a very wide berth. They’re
                        beginning to drag you down in that one thing — I say no more nor less than
                        I’m sure of — that you aren’t part of nature. Do you think it strange of me
                        that I dare to say as much as this: now, at the very beginning, change
                        course now and no later than now in so far as you work at restoring the bond
                        between yourself and nature? The more you remain in the frame of mind of not
                        being part of nature, the more you play into the hands of your eternal enemy
                        (and mine too), Nerves.</stress> I have more experience than you of the sort
                    of tricks they could play on you. You’re now beginning to enter waters that are
                    throwing you off balance, inasmuch as the rapport with nature seems to be
                    broken. Take that very coolly as a sign of aberration; say, oh no, not that way
                    if you please. Seek a new passion, an interest in something; think, for example,
                    after all perspective must fundamentally be the simplest of all things and
                    chiaroscuro a simple, not a complicated matter. It must be something that speaks
                    for itself, otherwise I don’t much care for it. Try to get back to nature in
                    this way. <good_health>Will you now, old chap, simply take it from me when I say
                        that as I write to you I’ve got something back of what I had years ago. That
                        I’m again taking pleasure in windmills, for example, that particularly here
                        in Drenthe I feel much as I did then, at the time when I first began to see
                        the beauty in art. You’d be prepared to call that a normal mood, wouldn’t
                        you? — finding the outdoor things beautiful, being calm enough to draw them,
                        to paint them.</good_health> And suppose you were to come up against a brick
                    wall somewhere, wouldn’t you find someone in my present mood composed enough to
                    want to take a little walk with him, precisely in order to have a distraction
                    from thoughts if, through nervousness, these thoughts start to acquire a certain
                    despairing element? <stress reason="family">You are yourself and not
                        fundamentally changed, but your nerves are beginning to be unstrung by
                        strain. Now, look after your nerves, and don’t take them lightly, because
                        they cause quicktempered manoeuvres — well, you know a thing or two about
                        that yourself.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>Make no mistake, Theo, at this moment Pa, Ma, Wil, Marie, and I above all, are
                    supported by you; it seems to you that you have to go on for our sakes, and
                    believe me I fully understand that, or at least can understand it to a very
                    great extent. Just think about this for a moment. What is your goal and Pa’s,
                    Ma’s, Wil’s, Marie’s and mine? What do we all want? We want, acting decently, to
                    keep our heads above water, we all want to arrive at a clear position, not a
                    false position, don’t we? This is what we all want, unanimously and sincerely,
                    however much we differ or don’t differ among ourselves. What are we all prepared
                    to do against fate? All, all of us without exception to work quietly, calmness.
                    Am I wrong in regarding the general situation in this way? Very well, what are
                    we facing now? <stress reason="family">We’re confronting a calamity which,
                        touching you, touches us all.</stress>
                    <good_health>Fine. A storm is brewing. We see it brewing. That lightning might
                        well strike us. Fine. What do we do now? Do we reach our wit’s end? I don’t
                        think that we’re inclined that way — even if certain nerves that we all have
                        in our bodies, even if certain fibres of the heart, finer than nerves, are
                        shocked or experience pain.</good_health>
                </p>
                <p>We are today what we were yesterday, even if the lightning strikes or even,
                    perhaps, should it thunder. Are we or are we not the sort who can look at things
                    calmly? That, simply, is the question, and I see no reason why we should not be
                    so. <unstress reason="family">What I also see is the following — that our
                        position towards one another is also straight at this moment. That for the
                        purposes of keeping straight it’s desirable to have a closer connection, and
                        in my view there are a few things in ourselves that we’ll have to work out
                        between us.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>In the first place, I would be very pleased if your relationship with Marie were
                    to be put on a firmer footing; in other words a formal engagement if
                    possible.</p>
                <p>Secondly, I would consider it desirable that we all understood that circumstances
                    urgently require that Brabant no longer be closed to me. I myself think it
                    better that I do not go there unless there’s no other choice, but in the event
                    of an emergency the rent that I’m obliged to pay could be saved, because Pa has
                    a house there rentfree.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="money">I’m at a point where there will probably be some income
                        from my work soon. And if we could now reduce expenditure to a minimum, even
                        below what it is at present, perhaps I could earn instead of consume, become
                        positive instead of negative.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>If it’s a question of our having to earn, I can see a chance in this way — if
                    there’s patience at home, a realization of the necessities, if above all, when
                    it comes to models for me, even the family cooperates. As to the question of
                    models, they’d definitely have to do what I wanted, have to trust that I had my
                    reasons for it. If I were to say to Ma or to Wil or Lies, pose for me, it would
                    have to happen. I wouldn’t make any unreasonable demands, of course. You know
                    how it came about that I left; the fundamental cause was misunderstanding one
                    another, actually in all things. So can we live together? Yes, for a time, if we
                    have to and people on both sides understand that everything has to be
                    subordinated to what the force majeure of circumstances dictates. I had hoped
                    that that was understood at the time, and I didn’t take the initiative to leave
                    — when I was told to go away, though, I went.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I broach this because I see that perhaps things will come to pass such
                    that you must have your hands free, and if it might help for me to live at home
                    for a while, I think that Pa and I would both have to reconcile ourselves to
                    that immediately. Although if it isn’t necessary — so much the better. But I’m
                    not saying that I absolutely must be in Drenthe; where isn’t the most important
                    thing.</p>
                <p>So be aware of this, that in that respect I would of course do whatever you
                    thought advisable.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="family">Well, I’ll write to Pa today, without more ado, simply
                        this: if Theo were to think it advisable that my expenses should be reduced
                        to a minimum and I should live at home for a while</stress>, <stress
                        reason="family">I hope that both you and I will have the sense not to put a
                        spoke in the wheel through mutual discord, but keeping silent about
                        everything that has passed will reconcile ourselves to what circumstances
                        bring. Nothing more about you or about business nor, should I have to live
                        at home, would I talk about you other than in general terms. And for the
                        time being I would certainly not mention Marie.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>Theo, if you had said perhaps a year ago that you would certainly not become a
                    painter, would certainly stay in your present profession, I would have had to
                    accede; now I don’t accede so readily, I still see that repeated occurrence in
                    the history of art of the phenomenon of two brothers who are painters. I know
                    that the future is unpredictable, at least I tell you that I don’t know how
                    things will turn out. However, it’s definitely the case that I believe in you as
                    an artist, and this is actually reinforced by some of the things in your last
                    letter.</p>
                <p>Mind now, I advise you of one thing that’s urgently necessary — beware of your
                    nerves — use all means to keep your constitution calm. Consult a doctor daily if
                    you possibly can, not so much because a doctor can do anything about it, as much
                    as would be needed, but because the very fact of going to a doctor to talk about
                    it &amp;c. will show you, this is nerves, that is me.</p>
                <p>
                    <good_health>It’s a question here of selfknowledge, of serenity, despite all the
                        tricks that the nerves must play. I consider the whole idea that it could
                        come to your making yourself scarce to be the effect of nerves. You would do
                        wisely and well to regard it in this way yourself.</good_health> I hope that
                    you will not bring off a coup, I hope that you will not make a financial
                    invention — I hope that you will become a painter. If, through cool aplomb, you
                    can let the crisis now deliberately being created by the gentlemen run off you
                    like water off a duck’s back, can say to them ‘I am certainly not leaving in
                    this way, certainly not now, never like this’ — if you say to them, I have plans
                    but they aren’t even of a commercial nature, and as soon as they can be put into
                    effect I’ll retire in all tranquillity; until that time, as long as you can’t
                    find fault with what I do, leave things as they are, but know that you’re very
                    much mistaken in me if you think that I would leave because you make things
                    impossible for me, or would part from you in any unreasonable way. If you want
                    to be rid of me, very well, I also want to be rid of you, but amicably and in
                    good order, and it goes without saying that I must keep going. Anyhow, try to
                    make them understand that you’re dead cool and calm and will remain so, however
                    that you have absolutely no desire whatsoever to stay — but that you won’t leave
                    until you see a favourable moment. This seems to me to be the way to counter
                    what they’re now trying to do, to make it impossible for you to stay. Perhaps
                    they suspect that you’ve already established relations elsewhere, and in such a
                    case making it impossible for someone to stay can sometimes be very nasty. If
                    they turn nasty now, there’s nothing for it, cut it short — perhaps the best
                    thing might be to explain calmly that you would retire on certain
                    conditions.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, let me know if I should go home for a while so that you have
                    your hands free. And again, Pa, Ma, Wil, Marie, I, in a word all of us, think
                    much more of you yourself than of your money. Making yourself scarce is nothing
                    but sheer nerves.</p>
                <p>But — restore — try to restore, even if it doesn’t happen all at once — the
                    rapport between you and nature and people. And if the only way to do this is to
                    become a painter, well then become one, even if you see ever so many objections
                    and impossibilities.</p>
                <p>Now listen — write to me very soon — be sure to do that. With a handshake.</p>

            </head>
            <body>
                <p>
                    <work origin="new" stage="sketch">I’m sending you the enclosed scratches to give
                        you some idea of so many diverse things that the seemingly monotonous
                        countryside has to offer.</work> You see, I just take what’s there, I grab
                    this and that by the neck; it will arrange itself and ripen of its own accord
                    later. But I don’t want to begin here with a preconceived plan; on the contrary,
                    I want my plan to ripen out of my studies. I don’t know the real character of
                    the countryside as yet — now I’m doing everything I come across, and then later,
                    when I have some experience, I want to try to convey it in what is fundamentally
                    its most characteristic aspect. The one so much part of the other that one has
                    to seize everything; however much one would like to concentrate, one may miss
                    nothing.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="environment">There’s plenty of work, in other words. I now
                        have a reasonably large room where a stove has been placed, where there
                        happens to be a small balcony. From which I can even see the heath with the
                        huts. I also look out on a very curious drawbridge. Well, downstairs is an
                        inn and a peasant kitchen with an open peat fire, very cosy in the evenings.
                        One can think best by one of those peasant hearths with a cradle beside it.
                        If I feel melancholy or can’t work something out, I just go
                        downstairs.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="love">I can tell you that I’ve heard something indirectly about
                        the woman. After all, I couldn’t for the life of me understand why she
                        hadn’t even written to me. Well then, I wrote to the carpenter next door to
                        us asking whether the woman hadn’t been to him for the address. Well then,
                        the blackguard writes back to me: Oh yes sir, but I thought that you
                        certainly wouldn’t want her to know your address, so I just made out that I
                        didn’t know it. Bastards.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>Then I wrote to her directly, although this wasn’t as good as my agreement, which
                    was expressly made with him and with her, but I do not want now or ever to
                    conceal or to have to conceal myself, and I’d rather write to her at her
                    family’s address than have even the semblance of hiding. That’s what I think
                    about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="money">And I sent her some money too — if this may have wretched
                        consequences, I’m not responsible for them, I will not play false.</stress>
                    I found the letter from that scoundrel in Hoogeveen on my last trip there.
                        <unstress reason="friendship">Friend Rappard also wrote to me again from
                        Terschelling and — now today — from Utrecht — he’s back again!</unstress>
                    Has brought studies with him, mostly of the old folks’ home. I don’t quite
                    understand this. He told me that the doctor had advised sea air for him during
                    the winter for his health, that moreover he had such a desire to spend a winter
                    in the country, but it seems to have turned out differently. Anyway. You wrote
                    to me about Liebermann: his coloration consists of slategrey tones with
                    transitions chiefly to brown, to yellowgrey. I’ve never seen anything by him,
                    but now that I see nature here I understand perfectly how reasonable it is that
                    he arrives at it. As to colour, things often remind me of Michel too. You know,
                    he also has a grey sky (slategrey sometimes), a brown earth with yellowgreys.
                    It’s completely true and faithful to nature. There are Jules Dupré effects —
                    yes, there are certainly those, but in autumn like this, it’s exactly that — as
                    you wrote about Liebermann.</p>
                <p>And if I find that which I seek — and why shouldn’t I find it? — I’ll certainly
                    often do it thus, in that same spectrum.</p>
                <p>That’s to say, in order to see it like this one mustn’t look at the local colour
                    in itself, but consider that local colour in relation to the tone of the
                    sky.</p>
                <p>That sky is grey — however so luminous that even our pure white might perhaps not
                    capture it in terms of light and brilliance. But if one starts by painting the
                    sky grey, thus remaining far below the intensity of nature, then all the more,
                    in order to remain consistent, will one have to set the browns and yellowgreys
                    of the earth several tones lower. It seems to me that this is something which,
                    once one analyzes it like this, is so selfevident that one finds it hard to
                    understand that one hasn’t always seen it thus.</p>
                <p>But it’s the local colour of a green field or a reddishbrown heath which, viewed
                    in isolation, can easily confuse someone. Write to me again soon because, as
                    letters go, your last missive was remarkably brief — all too brief, but was also
                    evidently written in the office.</p>
                <p>How’s the Triennial Exhibition going? There’ll be a lot of beautiful things. I’m
                    really interested to hear something about it, because these too are certainly
                    the characteristic things of the moment, not of much earlier years. So if you
                    have a moment, do write something about it.</p>
                <p>According to a current rumour, it appears that Liebermann is somewhere here in
                    the neighbourhood. I’d like to meet him sometime.<good_health>Well, I’m very
                        pleased that I’ve found a more suitable studio, precisely because it’s
                        rather rainy and the bad weather can be expected any time, so as not to have
                        to sit idle at home.</good_health>
                    <unstress reason="environment">I wish you could just see the countryside; it’s
                        so inexpressibly beautiful in the evening. And it seems to me the snow will
                        be gripping too.</unstress> I read a very good book by Carlyle, Heroes and
                    heroworship, full of nice things, like for instance, We have the duty to be
                    brave, although this is usually wrongly regarded as something exceptional. It’s
                    also true in life that the good is such a high light that it goes without saying
                    that we can’t reach that. If we set our spectrum lower and nonetheless try to
                    remain bright and not lapse into lifelessness, this is the most reasonable thing
                    to do, and makes life less impossible. There are amazing characters here —
                    nonconformist ministers with pig faces and cocked hats. Also many veritable Jews
                    who look extraordinarily ugly amidst Milletesque types or on this
                    unsophisticated, sad heath. On the other hand, they are genuine. I travelled
                    with a party of Jews who were having theological discussions with a couple of
                    peasants. How are such absurdities possible, one would say, in countryside like
                    this? Why can’t they look out of the window or smoke pipes or something, and at
                    any rate behave as reasonably as their pigs, say, which aren’t a nuisance at
                    all, even though they’re pigs, and remain in harmony with their surroundings and
                    are in place there?</p>
                <p>But before the ministers like the ones I saw here achieve the height of
                    civilization and reason of common pigs, they have to improve a good deal more,
                    and it will take centuries before they’re in that position. At the moment, any
                    pig at all is much better, to my mind.</p>
                <p>Well, I’m going out again, do write if you get a moment, and look particularly to
                    see whether Liebermann has anything in the exhibition.</p>
                <p>Regards — so my address just remains here for the time being — wishing you the
                    best, with a handshake</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Now I’ve already written about it once, I’ve thought about it again since then,
                    out on the heath. The same thing I’ve already thought about many times.</p>
                <p>Both among the old and among the modern painters there’s the constantly recurring
                    phenomenon of two brothers who are painters, whose work diverges less than it
                    runs parallel. They’re very different, yet complement each other perfectly. Take
                    the Ostades, Adriaan and Isaac. Anyway, you know very well, of course: a
                    multitude of cases. The Van Eycks as well. And Jules and Emile Breton in the
                    present day, to mention just a few.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="family">And I’ve already thought so very often that it must be
                        so almighty pleasant to work together, and both could be so productive for
                        the very reason that one supports the other and many melancholy times
                        disappear.</unstress> I can’t repeat to you enough, old chap — one is just
                    beginning in one’s thirtieth year. Look at the history of those people; even
                    many of them who painted from an early age only change then, only become
                    themselves then. I just want you to consider these things. Now I know that one
                    is faced with the question — bread.</p>
                <p>I don’t think it wrong, but quite right to reason: I have to eat, live
                    somewhere.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="money">All right, fine, but there’s one thing I ask everyone
                        who says, I don’t have the means — that question is: My friend, what are
                        your demands, how high do you set your standard? Is your character such that
                        you think the same about it as Corot, say, who wasn’t embarrassed, if he
                        could dine out, to buy a loaf from the baker and eat it in the fields? In
                        short, managing to make do and not clinging in the least to life’s
                        routine.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>This is precisely what you are au fond, and you would adapt perfectly to a host
                    of things. And even if the question of ‘bread’ hasn’t been resolved, it has been
                    largely cleared up.When I think now about the possibility or impossibility of
                    your coming here, now or later, and start working it out, then I come to the
                    conclusion that together we’d need little more or no more than I alone.
                        <unstress reason="family">And besides, for myself I firmly believe that I
                        would receive stimulation from you in so many things, would find support by
                        talking and discussing things with you, friction of ideas &amp;c., that I
                        would be able to work better.</unstress>

                    <work mention="vague">Now not a day passes, so to speak, but that I make one
                        thing or another.</work> I can’t help but make progress precisely through
                    learning by doing; every drawing one makes, every study one paints is a step.
                    It’s true that it’s like going along a road, one can see the steeple in the
                    distance, but the land undulates, so that when one thinks one is there, there’s
                    another stretch that one didn’t see at first and which is added on. However, one
                    does get nearer. <unstress reason="money">In a while, longer or shorter, I don’t
                        know how long, I’ll reach a point where I start selling. Very well, once
                        I’ve reached that point, it won’t be by halves for I don’t do things by
                        halves. And I’m doing different things at the same time; I’ll have more than
                        one string to my bow, and hence more than one arrow too. So you see what I
                        for my part can throw into the ‘bread’ gulf. Things can change for me, and
                        if I’m still not selling now, with all my hard graft — I repeat, that can
                        change.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>We’d have to have, let’s say, 150 francs a month as a minimum, preferably
                    200.Credit would have to be found for that, not without a security, but that
                    security would be our work.</p>
                <p>Let’s say that we’d have to work for another 2 years before we start to earn
                    quickly, and more than the outgoings, so that we can pay off the debt.200 francs
                    a month over 2 years is 24 x 200 francs = 2,400 francs. Let’s call it 1,500
                    guilders.</p>
                <p>The guarantee of this — I’m talking now about you and me working together — is
                    that we’ll already have thrown a lot into it ourselves and have laid a certain
                    foundation. What I can do, I can do, some aspects of drawing, yes and even some
                    aspects of painting are firmly ingrained in me, and not in the least
                    coincidentally but acquired through honest work. I say, yet another guarantee
                    that we aren’t just talking hot air.</p>
                <p>Listen Theo, I wouldn’t be able to talk to you if you didn’t have a certain
                    selfconfidence, a certain selfknowledge. I may already have told you before
                    that, au fond, you’re an artist, as time goes by that feeling gets stronger and
                    stronger in me. You’ll say ‘I can’t make anything’ — well of course you can’t
                    now, but just work for a year, wait till the initial things have become a little
                    clearer, and you’ll feel with the greatest serenity that, yes, perhaps not
                    everyone can become a painter through his own hard graft if he doesn’t have a
                    certain turn of mind, but for yourself you would discover that you really do
                    have that turn of mind of reflection, of thinking and analyzing, of feeling the
                    beauty in nature, and that you therefore can be an artist, because you have a
                    desire to work and energy, although they’re now going in another direction, so
                    that nothing can be left for art. But were that same desire to work to be the
                    driving force behind your feeling for beauty, the result would be a true
                    painter.</p>
                <p>I’ll just return briefly to the ‘bread’ question. A lot of things that people say
                    can’t be done actually can.Let me just suppose for a moment that you were at a
                    point where you had to change — (you aren’t at that point yet, I’m just
                    supposing it for a moment). Then you could get a position in another firm. Very
                    well, but your more distant future, not the foreground but the background, the
                    horizon, is that bright? It seems to me to be very much in darkness.</p>
                <p>Take, similarly, the more distant future if you become a painter; the darkness
                    isn’t there but it’s close by, right in the foreground.</p>
                <p>Your own diligence can make you a painter, and other people won’t be able to stop
                    you, but in the art business your own diligence may well not be the article that
                    certain bosses, even new ones, might require, particularly at times when they
                    themselves have got the wind up. With all your own diligence you could end up
                    like Wisselingh, who’s also very diligent and was with G&amp;Cie.I said many
                    things that people say can’t be done actually can be when you come down to it.
                    Why shouldn’t we be able to live with Pa if circumstances meant that we had to?
                    I don’t say for nothing, but in the event that we couldn’t get as much credit as
                    we’d need to last out here in Drenthe. But never mind that and concentrate on
                    the former. We’d have a hard struggle, but the pleasure of being together,
                    living together in this inexpressibly beautiful nature, above all the
                    consciousness of being two craftsmen, old chap, how almighty pleasant it would
                    be. So almighty pleasant that I scarcely dare think of it and yet can’t help
                    myself, although that happiness seems too tremendous to me, for you as well as
                    for me myself, since we aren’t accustomed to having pleasure in our lives, and
                    feel as if that were more for other people — not for us. <stress reason="money"

                        We’d make an arrangement for 2 years with the man here, if necessary pay a
                        sum in advance, I think that he’d do it for 1,000 guilders, give us both

                <p>Two years is a long time, is all you’ll need in the circumstances to reach a
                    certain level. We’d then have enough left over to lay in a big batch of paint,
                    to set ourselves up properly.</p>
                <p>Few things could then upset us or divert us from our plan, or anything else. Then

                <p>As for you, I would think that you must do other than I did. Mine is in the past,
                    I did what I did up to today, but I wish above all that you would start painting
                    straightaway; I do know what you’d want to make here. I would like you to get
                    down straightaway to landscapes conceived in the spirit of Michel, which I see
                    over and over again, wholly and utterly Michel, that is absolutely what it is
                    here. I’m pretty sure I would be able to help you on the way. <work
                        mention="vague">Time will tell what you want later but, as I say, I believe
                        I’d be able to help you on the way because I’ve been tackling things in that
                        genre myself in the last few days; I don’t pretend that they’re Michels, but
                        I do dare say that once you’ve gone that far you’ll find your own way from
                        there. For my part, particularly if you were here, I would concentrate more
                        and more on the figure.</work> I’ll just scribble down for you the
                    landscapes I have on the easel.You see here the genre of studies that I’d like
                    you to tackle straightaway. To learn to take a broad view of the landscape in
                    its simple lines and contrast of light and shade. <work origin="new"
                        stage="middle">I saw the top one today, was wholly and utterly Michel. That
                        earth was superb in reality. I don’t think my study is mature enough yet,
                        but the effect made an impression on me, and as far as light and shade are
                        concerned it was as I draw it here for you.</work>
                    <work origin="new" stage="middle">The bottom one, with a little delicate green
                        wheatfield in the foreground and withered grasses behind the cottage and
                        stacks of peat, is another glimpse of the heath, and the sky very
                        light.</work> You see, what I’m getting at is that you ought to start in
                    that genre, and would do well from the outset, it seems to me, definitely not to
                    draw exclusively.</p>
                <p>I mean everything I write to you here in absolute, absolute earnest, I’ve already
                    thought about it for so long. </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="money">And wouldn’t have spoken about it if everything had
                        remained well at G&amp;Cie, but now, in the circumstances, it’s only because
                        of my own wretched finances that I don’t say even more decidedly, come here
                        straightaway.</stress> Otherwise I wouldn’t say anything more than that. The
                    country is superb, superb, everything calls out to you: paint! So distinctive
                    and so varied. Look, old chap, however things go, aren’t there always financial
                    difficulties everywhere, and where are they less than here, and where or how on
                    earth can a time of struggle lead to a more permanent peace? To a great peace
                    that no one can disturb. <unstress reason="money">For myself, I can say no more
                        than that I’m willing to pledge all my own studies as security for the
                        repayment of what we absolutely need for the first two years. What’s more,
                        we don’t need all the money at once. I think it must be possible to find it.
                        I suggest the minimum because both you and I would arrange things very
                        economically.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="money">Now, as far as I’m concerned, I have a lot of plans, but
                        for myself I do wish that I could spend a hundred guilders to improve my
                        equipment. And I wish that I knew for certain that I would be able to be
                        here for two years, say, come what may. At the moment I have so little
                        security for the future, and I wish that I knew for sure that I wouldn’t
                        have to leave here again in a while.</stress> The plan I’m just setting out
                    here can be changed. It seems to me that the fundamental point remains that we
                    must manage things for two years such that we can have peace. Once the two years
                    are up, I’ll have reached a point where I’ll be earning regularly, and I hope
                    I’ll have regular work on such conditions that both you and I could continue in
                    the same way. The plan is simple enough. There would be talk about you, too, but
                    there would be 6 hours’ walking through Michels between the miserable little
                    town of Hoogeveen and you, so you wouldn’t be in the least bit bothered by it,
                    would you? You would be done with all of it, and by the time you’re 30 even the
                    house of Goupil would seem to you to be something out of a dream, and you
                    wouldn’t understand how you were once the boss on the boulevard and were treated
                    civilly, always civilly by M. l’administrateur général. About my coming to
                    Paris, oh, it’s a roundabout way, it seems to me, although if it’s more
                    convenient, very well — but it’s so wholly and entirely bound up with the change
                    you make, and if you change other than becoming a painter, I really fear that it
                    would nevertheless have to come to that in the end, and meanwhile it would have
                    become even more problematic. And would it then not be something for you to
                    refresh yourself and renew yourself wholly and entirely here. Through and
                    through, you know, renew everything, everything, through and through.</p>
                <p>I cannot write other than as I write.</p>
                <p>You’re a man of business; precisely because that’s what you are I don’t believe
                    you’ll reject all this out of prejudice. After all, there are always financial
                    difficulties and concerns, one can’t escape them anywhere, and fundamentally
                    this is something solid, since it will make you into an artisan. Is that a
                    backward step? No, it isn’t a backward step, and it seems to me that it’s the
                    right way. It would be the act of a man, an act that calls for collier’s faith.
                    Well then, I say, have that collier’s faith. Now, old chap, with a handshake</p>

            <sig>Vincent</sig>
            <ps>
                <p>Do write again very soon.Think of Barbizon, that’s a wonderful story. The ones
                    who originally started there when they got there – by no means all of them were
                    outwardly what they really were au fond. The country shaped them, all they knew
                    was: it’s no good in the city, I must go to the country; I imagine they thought,
                    I must learn to work, become something entirely different, yes, the opposite of
                    what I am now. They said, I’m no good now, I’m going to renew myself in nature.
                    At least, that’s how I reason, and although I’d go to Paris if it was absolutely
                    necessary, and also find something to do there — I believe my future here is
                    infinitely, infinitely better. Theo, your case is curious, almighty interesting.
                    Dare — risk — yes, that’s what you must do; have collier’s faith all the same
                    and even so, yes, you must have. But think now quite coolly about your highly
                    curious position. I can’t mince my words now, old chap — don’t hold it against
                    me — I just have to say it as it seems to me. You see a way in the art trade —
                    as far as I can see that makes you something like Wisselingh, to mention a good
                    man. I have great respect for Wisselingh, I like him, what you will, but even
                    now I’d like to say to him, old chap, become a painter even now. You’re much too
                    honest for the presentday art trade, much too clever &amp;c. Now is not the time
                    for it. If, on the contrary, you now persevere even more, seek your own
                    diligence, your own craft even more and say, I won’t hesitate, I’ll risk it,
                    I’ll push off from the shore into the open sea, you’ll get a certain sombre
                    seriousness straightaway — something mightily serious rises up from inside — one
                    looks at the calm shore, very well, it’s very pleasant — but the secret of the
                    deep, the intimate, serious charm of the Ocean, of the artist’s life — with the
                    Something on high above it — has taken hold of you. Very well — you aren’t a
                    Wisselingh any more — you’re something very different. You personally are what
                    the little boat is in a seascape by Jules Dupré. You are smaller but you are
                    bigger — you’re an artist and you can do nothing — sure enough, your act of
                    submission has already changed you — your own impotence or power is irrelevant
                    here. No, the renewal of life makes your whole nature different, your thoughts
                    and insights different, so that you would rather keep silent about it, and work.
                    Your work is ugly — fine — let it be ugly — it will annoy but not discourage
                    you. After scrabbling around for a while, lo and behold a scratch with a je ne
                    sais quoi in it — fine — that’s the portent.</p>
                <p>It bobs up and down — now you think: it will happen, then you think: it will
                    never work, but the longer you go on the more you’ll learn to have collier’s
                    faith. It will become more resolute even if there are still moments of bitter
                    melancholy.</p>
                <p>Matters of art soon become so serious that what people say about it is like the
                    croaking of ravens. The heath speaks to you, you listen to that still voice of
                    nature, and nature sometimes becomes a little less hostile; ultimately you are
                    her friend. Then your work is beautiful and calm too.But nature demands some
                    kind of submission, and she demands a period of wrestling with her.</p>
                <p>I can’t do anything else, if I speak honestly through and through I have to say,
                    Theo, become a painter, find a way to break out and come to Drenthe. People may
                    make a fuss, but you won’t hear much of it, a 6hour walk through Michel
                    landscapes lies between you and the everyday world.</p>
                <p>You would awaken, and when you got up you would find yourself by a peasant’s open
                    peat fire with a cradle beside it. You would think better there and feel
                    Correggio’s anche io — I too am a painter. They’d say, you aren’t — you would
                    reply, well, well. Now, if you were here — I mustn’t echo you now, but all
                    things considered say the same as you write to me — if you were here, I would
                    have a comrade, and as a result my work would make better progress. You wouldn’t
                    be without friends. You would soon have a very much more jovial rapport with
                    Rappard than before, Wisselingh would also remain loyal to you — although he’d
                    probably advise you against it. If you were here, I would become productive
                    sooner, I say the same, it’s too big for me on my own, I scarcely dare attempt
                    it on my own. I must have someone to discuss things with. Who knows what a
                    painting is. The thing that attracts me most about Paris, that would be of most
                    use in my progress, is actually being with you, having that friction of ideas
                    with someone who knows what a painting is, who understands the reasonableness of
                    the quest. I think Paris is all right because you’re in Paris, and if
                    consequently I were less alone I would get on faster, even there. Enough about
                    this for the moment. I don’t say that it could be done if we couldn’t afford to
                    pay for our coarse bread and our workplace. But with what I mentioned as the
                    minimum, I for one would very definitely cross off the impossibility.</p>
                <p>I have a simple plan for myself; I’ll go out and make whatever strikes me, fill
                    my lungs with heathland air, believe that in a while I’ll be fresher, newer,
                    better myself.</p>
                <p>Come on, old chap, come and paint with me on the heath, in the potato field, come
                    and walk with me behind the plough and the shepherd — come and stare into the
                    fire with me — just let the storm that blows across the heath blow through you.
                    Break out. I don’t know the future, how it could be different or not, whether
                    everything will go well for us. But all the same I can’t speak otherwise. Don’t
                    look for it in Paris, don’t look for it in America, it’s all the same, always
                    exactly the same. Change indeed, look for it on the heath.</p>
                <p>Regards, write soon, with a handshake.</p>
                <p>Ever yours,</p>

            <salutation>My dear brother —</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>I cannot count the grains of corn in a sack of corn just by smelling it — I
                    cannot see through the planks in the barn door — but I can sometimes see from
                    the bulges whether it’s a sack of potatoes or corn; or again, even if the barn
                    door is shut, I can tell from the squealing that the pig’s being
                    slaughtered.</p>
                <p>And so I can only, will only consider the situation in which you presently find
                    yourself in so far as I have information, albeit vague, to make sense of it, and
                    it isn’t by way of prediction.</p>
                <p>But to the point. Consider coolheadedly whether what you’re facing here is what
                    they call fatality on the field of battle. Consider the faces of your friends,
                    false friends, enemies, consider all the — je ne sais quoi’s — consider whether
                    a certain void is forming around you so that you no longer have any handholds,
                    at least are able to tie things up less easily. In short, consider whether
                    fatality is For or decidedly Against.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="family">Tell me this one thing, whether it’s a mistake on my
                        part when I think that I see in some phenomena that you’re dealing here with
                        one of those malignant crises that sometimes tend to crop up in big
                        businesses and big cities? Again, is the aspect of the things — fatal? — do
                        you feel: there’s nothing to be done about this? — or do you feel: redress
                        is possible, there’s no reason to change as yet?For myself, unless you were
                        to write to me yourself: no it isn’t that bad — for myself I see that the
                        affair has a fairly fatal look.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>Think about it coolheadedly — I know that you have your calmness, your presence
                    of mind — I know that you’re trying to analyze it, and so I just wanted to know
                    whether you yourself see anything of that which I fear is the case.</p>
                <p>Now, old chap, as long as the situation was tolerable — as long as business could
                    be done, well I’ve never dared to come right out and say, get out of it, above
                    all respecting your position, because you didn’t do it for your own pleasure but
                    for the sake of the welfare of us all. But your former duties, which, moreover,
                    you assumed voluntarily, cease to be duties in the event that the state of
                    affairs is such that going on wouldn’t only be fighting a losing battle, but at
                    the same time would inevitably result in your being crushed.</p>
                <p>In short, there’s a thus far and no further, and my premonition is that you’re
                    close to it.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="family">Look here — about now or ever — making yourself scarce
                        or disappearing — neither you nor I must ever do that, any more than a
                        suicide. I myself also have my moments of great melancholy, but the thought:
                        disappear, make yourself scarce, must, I repeat, be regarded by me and by
                        you as not befitting us.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>Against the risk of going on all the same when one feels it isn’t possible, going
                    on with the desperate feeling that it must end in a disappearance, our
                    conscience argues with a BEWARE!!! If I’m wrong, if my premonitions don’t square
                    with the facts I’m asking you about, if they do or do not have the decidedly
                    fatal aspect — well then I’ll believe your simple statement: ‘I do see a chance
                    of one thing and another working out’ (or similar information) when you write to
                    tell me so. If it’s a fait accompli that here you’re dealing with one of those
                    vicious crises such as Paris, London produce — if that’s so decidedly in the air
                    that you feel that it’s a force that would crush, if by trying to oppose it, one
                    would force the worst to happen — then, abandon the wreck and concentrate your
                    attention and energy not on preserving your present position, but on creating
                    something completely new.</p>
                <p>For a long time now it has seemed to me that your duty was too complicated — my
                    view is that your duty should be a simple thing, and the present situation would
                    become more complicated the longer it went on, and more doubtful as to whether
                    or not it really was duty; furthermore that through painting you’ll presently
                    find a very clear duty, a very simple, straight path for your feet. <stress
                        reason="money"> My idea is that continuing as at present would prove to be
                        not only more and more intolerable but moreover less and less profitable. I
                        don’t say this about G&amp;Cie alone, but also about you as a dealer in
                        general. I don’t say that you and I will get rich together, but we’ll be
                        able to maintain our aplomb and equilibrium, even though — this I cannot
                        deny — we’ll have a very hard struggle in the first few years.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="family">Yet, above our enterprise of painting I see not fatality
                        against but for, but you would, I fear, crush not just yourself but me too
                        by wanting to go ahead with what, in my opinion, really goes against the
                        grain. In the first place we wouldn’t be able to support each other and each
                        of us would stand too much alone. In the second place, we’d cause each other
                        to waver by working in diametrically opposed directions so that, despite our
                        friendship, we’d turn our backs on each other now and then.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>Well, old chap, for me painting is too logical, too reasonable, too
                    straightforward for me to make a change. Well, you yourself helped me carry
                    through the idea of a craft; I know that basically it’s your own idea too, and
                    so it seems to me that we should go on to work together. My reason, my
                    conscience compels me to tell you what in part are also your own ideas, there’s
                    nothing for it but to undertake a radical renewal. I know that my words will
                    stand out oddly against what other people would say if you consulted them;
                    they’d dismiss it with ‘it will turn out all right’, ‘the desired changes will
                    happen’. I wasn’t to flatter you; very well, I don’t flatter. And as far as
                    inspiring you with courage, yes, I do dare to do that, I dare to inspire you
                    with the very highest, most cheerful courage and serenity, but only for
                    painting, and as to Paris only this — take a good look and see whether you don’t
                    have fate against you on that battlefield. Now, with a hearty handshake</p>
            </body>
            <close>Ever yours</close>
            <sig>Vincent</sig>
            <ps>
                <p>—Now then, the countryside here is very singular.</p>
                <p>Just suppose you were asked whether you’d want to be a painter if you could
                    suddenly be transported to the era 40 years ago, when things were as they were
                    when Corot &amp;c. were young – also that you wouldn’t be alone but would have a
                    comrade. Why I ask this — because in the countryside here, where people haven’t
                    yet progressed beyond diligence and barge, where everything is much purer than
                    I’ve ever seen anywhere, I feel exactly as though I myself had been transported
                    to the aforementioned time.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="environment">You have seen Drenthe — from the train, in haste,
                        long ago. But remotest Drenthe, if you come here, will make a very different
                        impression on you, and even you will feel just as if you were living in the
                        age of Van Goyen, Ruisdael, Michel; in short, in what one scarcely finds now
                        even in presentday Barbizon. It seems to me that this is something
                        important, because nature like this can sometimes awaken in a mind things
                        that would otherwise never have woken. I mean something of that free,
                        cheerful spirit of the past, I mean that nervous wavering can be silenced
                        that way.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="family">Yet I believe that alone in a region like this one could
                        be held up and become dull through lack of company. And for myself, I really
                        long for your collaboration.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>I think about you, however, not first and foremost for my sake; I think about you
                    first and foremost for your sake, although these also run together, although
                    they also enhance each other. What I see is that hanging on in Paris, even if
                    you could keep it up for years more, will nonetheless not bring you peace, and
                    will also not be as useful to other people as painting. I see that Paris will
                    put you in what I would call a false position in regard to your own duty. I’ll
                    leave being useful to others out of it, I don’t know whether this would truly
                    remain sound in the long term because you focus other, stupider minds on Paris,
                    a thought that upsets those very people, because they’d be intoxicated by
                    it.</p>
                <p>Make no mistake: everything had its reason until now, but in my view the signs of
                    the times point to a change of direction now, in a very different and much more
                    decisive way than ever happened before.</p>
                <p>This is not about weakening or giving up; on the contrary it’s about striking
                    calamity to the heart, planting in better soil the same energetic principle of
                    wanting to rise.</p>
                <p>The calamity leaves us our same courage and serious will.</p>
                <p>Let the world spitefully say what it wouldn’t refrain from saying, that can leave
                    you and me cold. And on the contrary, for ourselves, we’re counting on a
                    difficult life which has a goal other than earning as much money as we might
                    perhaps do.</p>
                <p>Our goal, first and foremost, is to reform ourselves through craft and contact
                    with nature, believing that it’s our duty first and foremost, precisely so that
                    we can remain straight with other people, and consistent.</p>
                <p>Our goal is ‘walking with God’ — as against living amid the affairs of the big
                    cities.</p>
                <p>We’ll do no one any harm by it. Our belief is that, yes – although, to some
                    people, it seems hypocritical to say this — our belief, I say, is that God helps
                    those who help themselves in so far as they concentrate their endeavours and
                    attention on that and roll up their sleeves to that end. The longer I think
                    about it the more I see that Millet believes in a something on High.</p>
                <p>He speaks of it very differently from Pa, for instance — for he leaves it more
                    vague, yet I see more in Millet’s vagueness than in Pa. And I see the same as in
                    Millet in Rembrandt, in Corot, in Breton, in Brion, in short in the work of
                    several people, although I don’t hear them hold forth about it.</p>
                <p>The end of things doesn’t have to be an ability to explain but to base oneself on
                    it effectively.</p>
                <p>In short, Theo, a certain indeterminate but nonetheless fixed feeling in me that
                    it’s the first duty to direct the heart upwards leads me, as brother and as
                    friend to a brother and a friend, to ask you to consider directing yourself
                    towards a life founded on simpler principles.</p>
                <p>Principles that I can’t define other than: sensing that duty is unlikely to bring
                    someone to the Paris business, but rather points to retiring from it.</p>
                <p>Can you share this sense to some extent? Think about it, reflect on it; if you
                    need time for it, put yourself to the test and take your time. Any hesitation
                    along the lines of ‘I’m not an artist’, though, only seems justified to me in so
                    far as it doesn’t stand in the way of doing what you have to do and I have to do
                    to become one. Neither we ourselves nor other people can fully explain the
                    extent to which we are not one, the extent to which we are. Only the How to do
                    it system involves saying I’ll do my best to do it, asking no such questions; in
                    my view the How not to do it system is only that which says ‘I know in advance
                    that I can’t do it anyway’. One isn’t sure of one’s case all at once, one knows
                    nothing in advance other than very vaguely, but nevertheless something called
                    conscience is a sort of compass for man to distinguish between this direction
                    and that — between north and south, between right and left — broadly.
                    Consequently, in spite of chance currents, in spite of deceptively
                    friendly-looking coasts, to say, yes, but fundamentally this isn’t the right
                    direction. And there you have it, earning money in Paris, even for other people,
                    particularly given your recent experiences, seems to me to be a deceptive fata
                    Morgana, a coast that would recede further and further away the more you
                    continued to try to land there, meanwhile carrying you further and further away
                    from your proper direction.</p>
                <p>I respect all your hesitations and doubt, I respect your weighing up the pros and
                    cons, I don’t seek to force you to decide at once. But I just point out to you
                    very, very seriously and decidedly that it seems to me to be a fact that you’re
                    standing at a fork in the road and must reflect before you set out, before you
                    just persevere with Paris. The signs of the times, not I, tell you: Hold on!
                    what do you want? <stress reason="family">If you want Paris, very well — if you
                        can make up your mind to that, so be it — then I wouldn’t interfere in it,
                        but it won’t be that easy, and I’m afraid you could run up against fatality.
                        I strongly doubt whether you’ll preserve your peace as a result.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>I see everything against painting except fatality, I see everything for Paris
                    except fatality.</p>
                <p>Fatality in which I see with an inexpressible feeling God, Who is ‘the white Ray’
                    and has the last word: what isn’t good through and through isn’t good and
                    doesn’t endure; and against whom even the black ray is powerless.</p>
                <p>What you’re facing is something terrible, something awful — things are so
                    inexpressible that I have no words for them, that were I not your brother and
                    your friend, who would regard keeping silent as ungrateful and hardly humane, I
                    would say nothing. Well, seeing as you say, in the first place inspire me with
                    courage, in the second place don’t flatter me, I say: well then, I see this and
                    that in it, here on the silent heath where I feel God high above you and me.
                    With a hearty handshake.</p>
                <p>Ever yours,</p>

            <salutation>Dear brother,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Just wanted to tell you about a trip to Zweeloo, the village where Liebermann
                    stayed for a long time and made studies for his painting of the washerwomen at
                    the last Salon.</p>
                <p>Where Ter Meulen and Jules Bakhuyzen also spent some time.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="environment">Imagine a trip across the heath at 3 o’clock in
                        the morning in an open cart (I went with the man where I lodge, who had to
                        go to the market in Assen). Along a road, or ‘diek’ as they say here, which
                        they’d put mud on to raise it instead of sand. It was much nicer even than
                        the barge. When it was only just starting to get a little lighter and the
                        cocks were crowing everywhere by the huts scattered over the heath, the few
                        cottages we passed — surrounded by slender poplars whose yellow leaves one
                        could hear falling — an old squat tower in a little churchyard with earth
                        bank and beech hedge, the flat landscapes of heath or wheatfields,
                        everything, everything became just exactly like the most beautiful Corots. A
                        silence, a mystery, a peace as only he has painted.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>It was still very dark, though, when we got to Zweeloo at 6 o’clock in the
                    morning — I saw the real Corots even earlier in the morning. <unstress
                        reason="environment">The ride into the village was really so beautiful. Huge
                        mossy roofs on houses, barns, sheepfolds, sheds. The dwellings here are very
                        wide, among oak trees of a superb bronze. Tones of golden green in the moss,
                        of reddish or bluish or yellowish dark lilac greys in the soil, tones of
                        inexpressible purity in the green of the little wheatfields. Tones of black
                        in the wet trunks, standing out against golden showers of whirling, swirling
                        autumn leaves, which still hang in loose tufts, as if they were blown there,
                        loosely and with the sky shining through them, on poplars, birches, limes,
                        apple trees. The sky unbroken, clear, illuminating, not white but a lilac
                        that cannot be deciphered, white in which one sees swirling red, blue,
                        yellow, which reflects everything and one feels above one everywhere, which
                        is vaporous and unites with the thin mist below. Brings everything together
                        in a spectrum of delicate greys.</unstress> I didn’t find a single painter
                    in Zweeloo, though, and the people said they never come there in the winter.
                    It’s precisely in the winter that I hope to be there. Since there were no
                    painters, I decided to walk back and do some drawing on the way instead of
                    waiting for my landlord’s return.<work origin="new" stage="sketch">So I started
                        to make a sketch of the very apple orchard where Liebermann made his large
                        painting.</work> And then back along the road we had driven down early on.
                    At the moment that area around Zweeloo is entirely given over to young wheat —
                    vast, sometimes, that most tender of tender greens that I know. With above it a
                    sky of a delicate lilac white that gives an effect — I don’t think it can be
                    painted, but for me it’s the basic tone that one must know in order to know what
                    the basis of other effects is.</p>
                <p>A black earth, flat — infinite — a clear sky of delicate lilac white. That earth
                    brings forth that young wheat — it’s as if that wheat is a growth of mould.
                    That’s what the good, fertile fields of Drenthe are, au fond — everything in a
                    vaporous atmosphere. Think of the Last day of creation by Brion — well,
                    yesterday I felt that I understood the meaning of that painting.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="environment">The poor soil of Drenthe is the same, only the
                        black earth is even blacker — like soot — not a lilac black like the
                        furrows, and melancholically overgrown with eternally rotting heather and
                        peat. I see that everywhere — the chance effects on that infinite
                        background: in the peat bogs the sod huts, in the fertile areas, really
                        primitive hulks of farmhouses and sheepfolds with low, very low walls, and
                        huge mossy roofs. Oaks around them. When one travels for hours and hours
                        through the region, one feels as if there’s actually nothing but that
                        infinite earth, that mould of wheat or heather, that infinite sky. Horses,
                        people seem as small as fleas then. One feels nothing any more, however big
                        it may be in itself, one only knows that there is land and sky. However, in
                        one’s capacity as a tiny speck watching other tiny specks — leaving aside
                        the infinite — one discovers that every tiny speck is a Millet. I passed a
                        little old church, just exactly, just exactly the church at Gréville in
                        Millet’s little painting in the Luxembourg; but here, instead of the little
                        peasant with the spade in that painting, a shepherd with a flock of sheep
                        came along the hedge. One didn’t see through to the sea in the background
                        but only to the sea of young wheat, the sea of furrows instead of that of
                        the waves. The effect produced: the same. I saw ploughmen, very busy now, a
                        sandcart, shepherds, road workers, dungcarts. In a little inn along the way
                        drew a little old woman at the spinning wheel, little dark silhouette — like
                        something out of a fairy tale — little dark silhouette against a bright
                        window through which one saw the bright sky and a path through the delicate
                        green and a few geese cropping the grass.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="environment">And then, when dusk fell — imagine the silence,
                        the peace of that moment! Imagine, right then, an avenue of tall poplars
                        with the autumn leaves, imagine a broad muddy road, all black mud with the
                        endless heath on the right, the endless heath on the left, a few black,
                        triangular silhouettes of sod huts, with the red glow of the fire shining
                        through the tiny windows, with a few pools of dirty, yellowish water that
                        reflect the sky, where bogwood trunks lie rotting. Imagine this muddy mess
                        in the evening twilight with a whitish sky above, so everything black on
                        white. And in this muddy mess a rough figure — the shepherd — a throng of
                        oval masses, half wool, half mud, that bump into one another, jostle one
                        another — the flock. You see it coming — you stand in the midst of it — you
                        turn round and follow them.With difficulty and reluctantly they progress
                        along the muddy road. Still, there’s the farm in the distance — a few mossy
                        roofs and piles of straw and peat between the poplars. Again the sheepfold
                        is like a triangle in silhouette. Dark.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>The door stands wide open like the entrance to a dark cave. The light from the
                    sky behind shines through the cracks in the boards at the back. The whole
                    caravan of masses of wool and mud disappears into this cave — the shepherd and a
                    woman with a lantern shut the doors behind them.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="environment">That return of the flock in the dusk was the
                        finale of the symphony that I heard yesterday. That day passed like a dream,
                        I had been so immersed in that heartrending music all day that I had
                        literally forgotten even to eat and drink — I took a slice of coarse peasant
                        bread and a cup of coffee at the little inn where I drew the spinning wheel.
                        The day was over, and from dawn to dusk, or rather from one night to the
                        other night, I had forgotten myself in that symphony.</unstress>
                    <unstress reason="career">I came home and, sitting by the fire, it occurred to
                        me that I was hungry, and I found I was terribly hungry. But that’s how it
                        is here. One feels exactly as if one had been at an exhibition of one
                        hundred masterpieces, for example. What does one get out of a day like that?
                        Just a few scratches. And yet one gets something else out of it, too — a
                        calm passion for work.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>Above all, do write to me soon. It’s Friday today but your letter isn’t here yet;
                    I’m looking forward to it eagerly. It takes time to get it changed, since it has
                    to go back to Hoogeveen again and then back here again. We don’t know how it
                    will work out, but apart from that I would now say — the simplest thing perhaps
                    would be to send money once a month. In any event write again soon. With a
                    handshake.</p>

            <salutation>Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>You once wrote to me about a certain difference in our respective physiognomies.
                    Very well. And your conclusion was that I would be more of a thinker. What shall
                    I say about that? I am indeed aware of a mode of thinking within me, but
                    nevertheless I don’t feel that my thinking is really organized within me. I feel
                    that I’m a little different from being a real thinker. When I think about you I
                    see action, very characteristic, so be it, but also so decidedly not in
                    isolation, and on the contrary accompanied by so much feeling and indeed
                    thinking too, that my conclusion is that there’s more similarity than difference
                    between you and me. I don’t say there’s no difference — but having got to know
                    you better of late it seems to me that the difference is less than I thought for
                    a while in years past.</p>
                <p>When I look at our temperament and type of physiognomy, I find rapports and very
                    pronounced similarities between, for example, the Puritans and ourselves. I.e.
                    the folk from around Cromwell’s time, a small band of men and women who sailed
                    out to America in the Mayflower, away from an old world, and settled there,
                    determined to live in simplicity. Times change — they cut down forests — we’d
                    turn to painting. I know that the initiative taken by a small band, known to
                    history as the Pilgrim Fathers, however small in itself, had great consequences.
                    And for ourselves I’d think in the first place that we shouldn’t really
                    philosophize about great consequences, should seek nothing but a path for
                    ourselves so that we can travel through life as straight as possible.
                    Premeditating consequences is not our way, neither yours nor mine. When I speak
                    of the Pilgrim Fathers it’s for reasons of physiognomy, to point out to you that
                    certain redheaded folk with square foreheads aren’t thinkers alone nor men of
                    action alone, but usually have both elements combined. I recognize a figure of
                    one of those Puritans in Boughton’s paintings, and if I didn’t know better I
                    would believe that you had posed for it. The physiognomy above all, exact, exact
                    — a little silhouette on a rock against a background of sea and mist — if need
                    be I can also show you myself, i.e. that variation of the same physiognomy, but
                    my profile is less characteristic. Pa sometimes mulled over the story of Jacob
                    and Esau with regard to you and me — not entirely mistakenly — although happily
                    there’s less enmity, to mention just one difference, and in the Bible itself
                    there are examples aplenty of better relations between brothers than existed
                    between the aforementioned venerable patriarchs.</p>
                <p>I sometimes thought myself about being a thinker, but I saw more and more that I
                    wasn’t cut out for it, and because now, unfortunately, the prejudice that
                    someone who has a need to think things through is not practical and only belongs
                    among the dreamers, because this prejudice is very respected in society, I
                    usually got into trouble precisely by not keeping things to myself enough.</p>
                <p>But since then, the very history of the Puritans and the history of Cromwell, as
                    Carlyle conceived it, for instance, made me see how much thinking and acting
                    don’t rule one another out, and the sharp distinctions between thinking and
                    acting that it’s customary to assume nowadays, as if one rules out the other,
                    don’t actually exist.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="career">As to doubting oneself, whether one is an artist or
                        not — that entire question is too much of an abstraction. I say that I have
                        nothing against thinking about it, though, provided I may also draw and
                        paint. And — my plan for my life is to make paintings and drawings, as many
                        and as well as I can — then, when my life is over, I hope to depart in no
                        other way than looking back with love and wistfulness and thinking, oh
                        paintings that I would have made! But this doesn’t, if you please, rule out
                        making what is possible. Do you have anything against this, either for me or
                        for you?</unstress>
                    <stress reason="family">I wish that painting became such a fixed idea with you
                        that the question, am I an artist or am I not an artist, was somewhat
                        consigned to the realm of abstractions, and that more practical questions
                        concerning putting a figure or a landscape together would come to the fore,
                        being more enjoyable.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>Theo, I declare to you that I would rather think about how arms, legs, head
                    attach to a torso than whether or not I myself am more of an artist or less. I
                    think that you would rather think about a sky with grey clouds and their shining
                    edges over a muddy piece of land than ponder on the question of yourself.Well, I
                    do know it though, sometimes the mind is full of it, it can’t be helped. Look
                    here, brother, even if our mind is sometimes occupied by the question is there a
                    God or does He not exist, this is no reason for us deliberately to commit a
                    godless act, is it? Likewise the question, artistically, am I an artist or not?
                    shouldn’t lead us not to draw or not to paint. Many things can’t be defined, and
                    in my view wasting too much time on them is wrong. Now, if the work doesn’t go
                    well or one runs up against a lack of knowledge, one becomes bogged down in such
                    thoughts and insoluble questions. And feeling troubled by this, the best thing
                    to do is to overcome the cause of the distraction by getting a fresh view of the
                    practical side of the work. Now for my part, seeing both in you and in me
                    something of that puritanical character that unites thinking and doing so much
                    and is so far from wanting to be only a thinker or only a machine, that has a
                    need both for principles of simplicity and for motivated work at the same time,
                    I do not admit a separation or divergence, much less that you and I should be
                    opposites.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="family">In my view it would be an error of judgement if you were
                        to continue in business in Paris.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>So the conclusion, two brothers, painters. Whether it’s in your nature? You could
                    occupy yourself struggling hard and fruitlessly against nature precisely by
                    doubting whether you can, and thus hamper your own liberation. Sadly, I know
                    that all too well in my own case. After all — even despite our being against
                    ourselves, I’m starting to realize more and more, man proposes, God disposes.
                    There’s an infinitely powerful force over our doing right and our doing wrong.
                        <stress reason="family">Likewise your circumstances — be sensible — perhaps
                        even so sensible that you become a painter for good and all. It would
                        basically reassure me so much if I saw you pick up the brush that I’d reckon
                        the disaster and shipwreck of the moment as being of less importance than
                        the future certainty of heading in a direction you won’t regret.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="family">But I do wish you would find immediate tranquillity for
                        your heart in the matter of women. If that were possible, you would be even
                        stronger, since being loved gives one certain wings, certain surprising
                        courage and energy. Then one is more a whole person than otherwise. And the
                        sooner one is that the better.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>In any case, I reckon it among the possibilities that you yourself will come to
                    realize that your path is painting, and then, my dear brother, Puritan without
                    knowing it, it could well be that your time in Paris is coming to an end, an old
                    world closing itself off from you in a less than generous manner — however a new
                    world opening up to you — appearing inhospitable and rough, together with all
                    that, a certain hope and high courage in the heart, one feels the something on
                    High above the barren shore, and so one turns one’s hand to the plough — asking
                    no questions.</p>
                <p>Well, think about it, more or less, for a long or short while. But it wouldn’t
                    help if you were to say, Vincent, be quiet about it, for I’d reply, Theo,
                    perhaps it won’t be quiet in yourself.</p>
                <p>It is more difficult to contain</p>
                <p>Than the source of great rivers.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="love">Theo, I’ve heard from the poor woman a few times since.
                        She seems to be carrying on working, doing washing for people, serving as a
                        temporary help, in short doing her best. Writes almost indecipherably and
                        incoherently. Seems to regret some things from the past. Children healthy
                        and well. My pity and affection for her are certainly not dead, and I do
                        hope that we’ll retain a bond of affection, although I don’t believe that
                        living together again would be desirable or possible. Pity may not be love,
                        but that doesn’t alter the fact that it can go deep.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="environment">Well brother, to change the subject, it’s snowing
                        here today in the form of colossal hailstones. I say it’s snowing because of
                        the effect. I’m keeping silent about the beauty of it here, because I would
                        have TOO MUCH to tell you about it.</unstress>
                    <unstress reason="family">As to work, I’m almost overbrimming because of the
                        idea that you might start on it, which has a surprising hold on me. I wish
                        it could be decided, precisely so that we could make definite plans for
                        working together.</unstress>
                    <unstress reason="environment">Drenthe is so beautiful, it absorbs and fulfils
                        me so utterly that, if I couldn’t stay here forever I would rather not have
                        seen it at all.</unstress> It’s inexpressibly beautiful. With a
                    handshake.</p>

            <head>
                <location>Nieuw-Amsterdam</location>
                <date>1 December 1883</date>
            </head>
            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Thanks for your letter and the enclosure. Your letter explains your silence to
                    me.</p>
                <p>You thought that ‘feeling that I was flush’, I was giving you an ‘ultimatum’ — in
                    the way — similar — that the nihilists, say, might send them to the Tsar. Well,
                    fortunately both for you and for me, there’s no question here of anything of the
                    kind or similar.</p>
                <p>However, I do understand your interpretation now that I know what it is, but I
                    had to know. <stress reason="family">For a start I meant something different —
                        it was simply: ‘I wouldn’t want to flourish if you had to wither in
                        consequence; I wouldn’t want to develop the artistic in me if you had to
                        suppress the artistic in you for my sake. I wouldn’t approve if you were to
                        suppress the artistic in you for anyone’s sake, even for the sake of father,
                        mother, sister, brother or wife’. There you have my meaning — perhaps
                        expressed nervously and in the wrong words — most decidedly there was no
                        more nor anything else behind it than that.</stress> You understand it well
                    enough now, don’t you?</p>
                <p>As to what I wrote in my last letter, it arose out of your silence, an absolute
                    mystery to me, absolutely inexplicable to me until I knew what the matter was. I
                    already had an answer as far as Marie is concerned before I ever received your
                    letter, simply because I remembered what you wrote to me in the past about your
                    meeting with her and thought, that has to be all right, that can’t be what’s
                    wrong. <stress reason="family">So even my letter on the subject was meant like
                        this: brother, you seem to abandon me without warning; if you did this on
                        purpose it would be treachery in my view, but I CAN not think that, so
                        ‘explain it to me’ — no more nor less than this was behind that, and as to
                        what I said about Lady Macbeth, you’ve interpreted it correctly, as a hint
                        in general that was not even a question but only to make you feel: either it
                        has to be like this or it is a misunderstanding.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <bad_health>Be aware of this, though, brother, that I’m absolutely cut off from
                        the outside world — except for you — so that for me it was enough to make me
                        crazy when your letter didn’t come at a moment when, far from being ‘flush’,
                        I was in dire straits — although I didn’t mention that — because I reckon
                        that I’m somewhat above the cares that peck at my vitals, regarding this
                        torture as understandable, so be it, although not as deserved.</bad_health>
                    As to ‘I wouldn’t want to flourish if someone else had to wither in
                    consequence’, I hope that I would say this — which lay in what you conceived to
                    be an ultimatum —whether I was ‘flush’ OR in ‘agony’.</p>
                <p>It seems to me that the conclusion that I spoke as if I was ‘flush’ was rather
                    shallow or hasty on your part — although it must have been in the way I
                    expressed it, for it was certainly not what I felt. <stress reason="money">I
                        just want to tell you that since I’ve been here I’ve had to see to it that
                        my equipment was organized, that I had paint, that I went to see this and
                        that, that I paid for my lodgings, that I sent the woman something, that I
                        paid off some debts. All this keeping me very hard up all the time — to put
                        it mildly.</stress>
                    <stress reason="friendship">Add to this that singular torture... loneliness, and
                        you really will no longer be able to think that there’s any possibility of
                        my feeling ‘flush’ for the time being — or that I felt it then.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>I say loneliness and not even in peace — but that loneliness which a painter in
                    an isolated region encounters when every Tom, Dick and Harry takes him to be a
                    madman — a murderer — a vagabond &amp;c. &amp;c. Granted it may be a petty
                    vexation, but a vexation it is. Being a stranger, doubly strange and unpleasant
                    — <unstress reason="environment">however stimulating and beautiful the
                        countryside may be.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>But I see in this only a bad time that one has to get through. <stress
                        reason="career">Something, though, which one can do very little about
                        oneself — that is, about the attitude of the people whom one would so much
                        like to have as models and can’t get.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="family">With hindsight, I see clearly enough how you and I came
                        to misunderstand each other. There was a moment when you were very
                        melancholy, and you wrote me the following: the gentlemen are making it
                        almost impossible for me, and I actually believe that they would rather
                        dismiss me than that I should resign (the underlined precisely my case at
                        the time). And you said, ‘sometimes I think I should just disappear’ — and
                        you said — there were things about the idea of painting to which you were at
                        least not averse.</stress>Very well — then I candidly told you all my
                    thoughts about the possibility of your becoming a painter, I said you can do it
                    provided you want to, and I believe in you as an artist, from the moment you
                    pick up a brush, even if no one else does.</p>
                <p>What I said about that, I’ll say to you in the future should a misfortune — a
                    calamity — strike you — what is now stopping you from ‘a complete renewal’ is
                    indeed a misfortune. If a calamity were to strike you, I believe that you as a
                    person would become a greater person as a result, with — with — with — an
                    eternally painful wound at the same time.</p>
                <p>I would expect of you that it would raise you up, not ‘drag you down’, that wound
                    which can only be caused by a calamity. But your later letters differ so much in
                    tone and so much in content that I now say: if your rigged ship is sound, very
                    well, then stay on it.</p>
                <p>However I’ll always maintain what I said should a calamity put you in a different
                    position in relation to society. Were that ever to happen, I say in that regard:
                    let it be a sign for you to make a complete change of profession, rather than
                    starting all over again doing the same thing.</p>
                <p>But as long as you have your rigged ship, I don’t say that I advise you to put to
                    sea in a fishingboat. Although I wouldn’t wish for G&amp;Cie’s rigged ship back,
                    as far as I personally am concerned. At the time I thought, for God’s sake,
                    calamity — do your worst!</p>
                <p>At first I didn’t know what to think about the change in the tone of your
                    letters. Now, looking back, I think as regards your somewhat melancholy but for
                    me so touching letter, written at a time when G&amp;Cie were being terribly
                    nasty to you (a moment COMPARABLE to what I experienced myself) — now in
                    hindsight I think, I say, that you took a different view of that moment when I
                    said to the G&amp;Cie gentlemen ‘if you force me to go, I won’t refuse to go’,
                    and that things really have calmed down, perhaps for good — and with your
                    consent — so be it — I won’t object. Well, I do not take it amiss of you —
                    because I believe that in such a case certain conditions that really are
                    acceptable can be laid down — and I think that you would not have accepted them
                    were there to have been anything dishonest in accepting them. <stress
                        reason="family">But why I said something like, ‘if you stay then I’ll refuse
                        your financial support,’ was because you had said ‘let me stay where I am
                        because I have to take care of Pa, Ma, Wil and Marie’, and (although you
                        didn’t mention me) me as well. Tact on your part not to mention me, to which
                        I had to respond with tact on my part — I don’t want that — you sacrificing
                        yourself in so far as you would stay there against your will for the sake of
                        others. There you have what you interpreted as giving you an
                        ultimatum.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>If you stay there because ‘you have a renewed pleasure in it’ — it’s all to the
                    good as far as I’m concerned, and I congratulate you on your newly rigged ship,
                    although for myself I have no desire to go back. What you write about Serret
                    interests me greatly. A man like that who eventually produces something
                    heartrending as blossom from a hard and difficult life is a phenomenon like the
                    blackthorn, or better yet a gnarled old apple tree which suddenly bears blossoms
                    that are among the tenderest and most ‘pure’ things under the sun.</p>
                <p>When a rough man blossoms — it’s indeed a beautiful sight — but HE has had to
                    endure an awful lot of cold winters before then — more than even the later
                    sympathizers know.</p>
                <p>The artist’s life and WHAT an artist is, that’s very curious — how deep is it —
                    infinitely deep.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="money">Because of your silence, inexplicable to me, and because
                        I also associated it with the possible resumption of difficulties with the
                        gentlemen, because for my part I was intolerably hardpressed as a result of
                        the mistrust of the people in the lodgings, I dropped Pa a line that, not
                        having heard from you, I didn’t know what to think and asked Pa for a
                        loan.</stress>
                    <stress reason="family">I added that I was uneasy both about you and about
                        myself, particularly when I thought about the future, and I wished that both
                        you and I had become painters when we were boys, and actually saw no reason
                        why we two brothers shouldn’t be painters even now if G&amp;Cie were not to
                        remain what it once was to you.</stress> Should Pa ever write to you about
                    it, you know the reason for it, but I’ll write to Pa myself (I haven’t had a
                    reply from Pa yet) that your last letter has made it plain to me that for the
                    time being G&amp;Cie remains G&amp;Cie. I add this to you, not to Pa: since
                    G&amp;Cie exercises an influence on our family, strangely compounded of good and
                    evil; good, certainly, in any event because it prevents much stagnation (evil
                    not being in question for the moment).</p>
                <p>
                    <bad_health>That my heart perhaps has and feels bitterness of its own is
                        something that in my view you both understand and consequently forgive me
                        out of yourself.</bad_health>
                </p>
                <p>Ultimatum — YOU speak of it — NOT I (at least my intention was something very
                    different) — if you want to interpret it that way — then it’s all right with me,
                    but I shall not be the first — nor have I been — for the moment your
                    interpretation runs very far ahead of my intention. I would perhaps not
                    contradict you any more than I did G&amp;Cie in the past, if you wanted to carry
                    it through. Then I would say again, you said ultimatum first, NOT I. If you want
                    to interpret it thus, then I don’t oppose this interpretation. With a
                    handshake.</p>

                    <unstress reason="family">Brother — after your last letter all my worst vague
                        anxieties have been quieted — I mean that I have complete confidence in you
                        as a man and in Marie.</unstress>

                    <stress reason="money">But I simply think that you’ll run into certain financial
                        difficulties because of the course of events.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>I advise you, if you can economize on something, then economize, that’s to say if
                    you can put something by, then put something by.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="money">I myself have nothing at the moment — but I’ll see if I
                        can arouse some interest in certain plans of mine — or if no one wants to
                        come back to Drenthe with me later on, then at least see if I can’t find
                        some credit for myself so that I can settle there. I’m not flush, I have
                        nothing.</stress>

                <p>
                    <stress reason="family">I’ve seen how shaky your finances have been for a long
                        time — you had too much on your shoulders — you think now that the future
                        will put it right — I think you’ll find the future hostile in
                        Paris.</stress> Again, if I’m wrong you can all laugh at me and I’ll laugh
                    about it myself. If it’s just my nerves deluding me, well then, it’s my nerves —
                    but I fear you all too effectively have a fatality against you.I’ll be able to
                    write to you more calmly from home. <stress reason="money">There’s certainly a
                        working environment for me in Drenthe, but preferably I’ll have to be able
                        to look at things rather differently from the outset and have a little more
                        certainty in my finances. I have to watch the cents — on a small scale; at
                        present, for instance, obviously I concede that this is the first time you
                        have definitely skipped — the difference of some 25 guilders is something
                        that may stump me again for 6 weeks perhaps.</stress> I can readily believe
                    that you can’t imagine this — you cannot know what sort of difficulties over and
                    over again, each very small in itself, make something possible or impossible.
                    Don’t take it amiss of me, but believe me that I have to try to take some steps
                    in order to accomplish what I want. <stress reason="money">Last week, for
                        instance, I got a note from my former landlord, who gave me the impression
                        that he could seize my things that I left behind (including all my studies,
                        prints, books — that I could hardly do without) if I didn’t send him 10
                        guilders that I’ve promised him as payment for the use of an attic room for
                        my belongings, and some rent that it was doubtful he was entitled to claim,
                        but I agreed on condition of an arrangement to store my things. I have to
                        pay for other things by the New Year, I still have to pay Rappard, and I
                        economized on everything I could. In short, it’s not the same as feeling
                        flush. Things can’t remain as they are at present. I have to find a way out.
                        I don’t say that you’re to blame, of course, but even last year I couldn’t
                        have economized more than I did. And the harder I work, the more hardpressed
                        I become. We’re now at a point where I say: at present I cannot go
                        on.</stress>

            </head>
            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>You’ll have been rather surprised that I dropped you a line that I would go home
                    sometime, and am now writing to you from here. </p>
                <p>But first I must thank you for your letter of 1 December, which I’ve just
                    received here in Nuenen.</p>
                <p>
                    <bad_health>The last 3 weeks I was actually rather unwell — was troubled by
                        various things that arose out of having caught a cold, and nerves as
                        well.</bad_health>
                </p>
                <p>One must try to break something like that, and I felt that I would get worse if I
                    didn’t have a change.Well, I decided to go home for various reasons — something
                    I was actually very loath to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="environment">My journey began with a walk of more than 6 hours
                        — mostly across the heath — to Hoogeveen. On a stormy afternoon with rain,
                        with snow. This walk cheered me up no end, or rather my feelings were so in
                        sympathy with nature that it calmed me down more than anything
                        else.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>I thought that being at home again might give me a more accurate insight into the
                    question of what I should do.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="money">Drenthe is superb, but staying there depends on many
                        things — depends on whether one has the money for it,</stress>
                    <stress reason="friendship">depends on whether one can endure the
                        loneliness.</stress>
                    <stress reason="family">Pa would consider that question settled, I believe, with
                        a conclusion that one would reach in a conversation, but for my part I’m in
                        no hurry to make a decision about it, and I’ll have to see what I think
                        about it, for instance, when I’ve been here for a week or so.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>However, for the time being I’m in the dark as to what I should do in this
                    respect. I see more and more that when one thinks or speaks about something, one
                    by no means arrives at a satisfactory conclusion. At one moment it seems more
                    possible than at another. And for my part I don’t let these things go at once
                    but keep thinking about them, sometimes long after other people consider that
                    they’re already decided.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="family">But, old chap, it’s so difficult for me, because for me
                        it becomes so much a matter of conscience that I would be too much of a
                        burden to you — perhaps abuse your friendship if I accept money for an
                        enterprise that may not pay.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>You write again about Moniteur Universel. Do you think it too gloomy of me when I
                    tell you that I regard it as possible that in a relatively few years’ time a
                    number of large art businesses — for example Moniteur Universel — in a word
                    others that have also expanded enormously — will decline — fall into decline as
                    quickly as they came up?</p>
                <p>In a relatively short space of time, everything that is the art trade developed
                    in rapport with art itself. But it became all too much a sort of bankers’
                    speculation and it still is — I do not say entirely — — I simply say much too
                    much. Why, in so far as it’s a bubble company, shouldn’t it go the same way as,
                    for instance, the tulip trade? You’ll point out to me that a painting isn’t a
                    tulip. Of course there’s a universe of difference, and naturally I, who love
                    paintings and tulips not at all, am very well aware of this. But I contend that
                    many rich people who buy the expensive paintings for one reason or another don’t
                    do it for the artistic value that they see in them — the difference between
                    tulip and painting that you and I see isn’t visible to them — they, the
                    speculators and blasé sots and a lot of others, would buy tulips now too, just
                    as in the past, provided there was a certain cachet to it.</p>
                <p>True, there are real, sterling art lovers. But it’s perhaps only 1/10th of the
                    total of the business that’s done, perhaps it’s even a much smaller proportion —
                    of which it can be said: this or that transaction was genuinely out of belief in
                    art.</p>
                <p>I could expand on this forever of course, but without going on about it any more
                    I believe that you agree with me that there’s a great deal in the art trade that
                    could prove to be hot air in the future. Things that are very highly priced now
                    can go down. If you ask me, can Millet and Corot go down, I say, yes, IN
                    PRICE.</p>
                <p>Anyway, from an artistic point of view, Millet is Millet, Corot Corot, fixed — as
                    the sun itself, in my view.</p>
                <p>Five years ago I thought differently about it, in so far as I thought that
                    Millet, say, would remain fixed, EVEN in price, but since then — precisely
                    because I see Millet is usually just as much utterly misunderstood now that he’s
                    less concealed and is more in evidence in reproductions, for instance, as when
                    he was despised — I fear he’ll remain somewhat outside public taste and — it
                    isn’t certain that those who understand him best will have to pay as much money
                    for him later as they do now. Rembrandt fell too — in price — in the periwig
                    age. I just want to ask you frankly, do you believe that the prices that are
                    still being paid now will stay? I tell you frankly, I do not believe it.</p>
                <p>Yet at the same time, to me Millet is Millet, Rembrandt Rembrandt, Israëls
                    Israëls &amp;c., whether it costs ten cents or a hundred thousand to buy one of
                    his paintings.</p>
                <p>Consequently I don’t think about the art trade much.</p>
                <p>Only when my thoughts turn to you and I come to ask you whether you can take
                    pleasure in it, or whether, especially later, you won’t see all too much that
                    goes against the grain with you to stay in it.</p>
                <p>You’ll say, one can get used to anything, or rather you’ll say, one must endure
                    until the heart breaks in us. So be it, I agree with you in that — but if the
                    heart does break in us, we’re still free to act in one way or another. And as
                    regards you or me, we are what we are, and because we’re enthusiastic about art,
                    we would each in our own way also remain constant in our opinion about Millet,
                    say, even if the most absurd things were to happen.</p>
                <p>But I ask: in the event of a gradual cooling off in the expenditure of tremendous
                    sums for paintings, how are the huge firms which have colossal sums in outgoings
                    etc. every year, which cut into their profits, going to succeed? They’ll soon
                    find themselves with enormous deficits. Trees like this don’t fall at the first
                    blow, but they can rot away inside and ultimately fall because of the wind
                    alone, without a single blow from an axe. When? I have absolutely no idea of the
                    exact date. If you will, just write to me about this question in general, for
                    example what you think of the staying power — in the long run — of an
                    establishment such as you say Moniteur Universel is — or Petit — or Arnold &amp;
                    Tripp. I tell you frankly, I don’t see that it can keep going in the long run. I
                    believe something like this has to collapse.</p>
                <p>In my view, it can’t be very pleasant to be on hand for this — I’d rather sit by
                    a peat fire, painting. <stress reason="money">The art trade, one feels a sort of
                        ‘what do I care’ about it, except — except — except — that I personally find
                        it very unpleasant if I’m really very short of money.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>You’ve always remained calm in Paris, very simple and certainly cooler than a man
                    like Tripp, say.</p>
                <p>You’re out to see things as they are, you — like me — can’t help analyzing. And
                    yet, even you don’t in the first place bring what you know of a situation to
                    bear in order to profit from that situation all the same.</p>
                <p>I mean, it isn’t in your nature to fish in troubled waters.</p>
                <p>But I ask you frankly, what’s the position? Do you really believe that the people
                    at Moniteur Universel will ask something different of employees from what
                    G&amp;Cie asks?</p>
                <p>Moniteur, G&amp;Cie, Tripp, Petit, to me they’re all similar firms. I believe in
                    my own case that, having been thrown out by one, I would be thrown out by them
                    all. If old Goupil says, you’re no good to us, I believe other bosses would also
                    think more or less the same.</p>
                <p>Well, as to you, I believe that it would be the same for you with another house
                    as it is with G&amp;Cie. In my opinion, setting up for oneself at a time when a
                    cooling off and decline could be foreseen is something that one cannot do with
                    any enthusiasm.</p>
                <p>So do you believe in these times, do you believe that the trade will stay at this
                    level? If you believed this, I would respect your opinion and keep quiet, but I
                    don’t know whether you know that I don’t really believe that the very large
                    firms can keep going. Do write to me about it, then it will be so much easier
                    for me to talk about it. <stress reason="family">I feel rather embarrassed with
                        you at the moment, and I want you to know my perhaps nervous opinion that
                        firstly I don’t believe that these highly inflated firms can keep going and,
                        secondly, even should they prove to keep going, I wouldn’t enjoy being
                        involved in them, directly or indirectly.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="money">Another thing is, if I can provide for myself by doing
                        this or that here or there, I won’t look such a gift horse in the mouth. If
                        it proves to be my duty to do this or that, very well, I won’t refuse the
                        work, not even unpleasant work.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>I thought of you brother, on my long trudge across the heath on that stormy
                    evening. I thought of a passage, I don’t know which book it’s from, two eyes
                    awake, brightened by genuine tears — <bad_health>I thought, I am disillusioned,
                        that is — I thought — I have believed in many things that I now know are in
                        a sorry state at bottom — I thought, these eyes of mine, here on this gloomy
                        evening, awake here in the solitude, if there have been tears in them from
                        time to time, why should they not have been wrung from me by such sorrow
                        that it disenchants — yes — and banishes illusions — but at the same time —
                        awakens one?</bad_health> I thought, is it POSSIBLE that Theo is easy about
                    many things that I’m uneasy about. </p>
                <p>
                    <bad_health>Could it be just melancholy, that I can’t take the old pleasure in
                        this or in that?</bad_health>
                </p>
                <p>In short, I thought, can I be mistaking gold for gilding? Am I mistaking
                    something that’s in full growth for something withering? I couldn’t come up with
                    an answer for myself. Can you? Do you know for sure that there isn’t already
                    faradvanced, unrelenting decline on all sides?</p>
                <p>Give me courage if you yourself have courage — but I say to you in my turn ‘don’t
                    flatter me’. <stress reason="money">I tell you that, as far as I’m concerned,
                        even if I become clever (which I am not noticeably as yet), I believe —
                        firmly believe — that I’ll always be very poor — it will exceed my
                        expectations if I manage to keep out of debt.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>The coming men in Holland after those mastodons Mesdag, Israëls, Mauve, Blommers,
                    Maris &amp;c. will, under no circumstances, still be able to earn what was
                    earned in those days, that is the last 20 years, say. And especially not if
                    they’re clever. One of the drawbacks of a period like the one we’re entering is
                    that a time when prices are inflated so high is, as it were, taking a lien on
                    the future, which makes the future dark for posterity. So, old chap, perhaps
                    Arnold &amp; Tripp have never treated you personally anything other than very
                    courteously or, in short, with due form. That doesn’t alter the fact that you,
                    who are just as clever as Uncle Cent, for instance, won’t be able to do what
                    Uncle Cent did. Why not? Because there are too many Arnold &amp; Tripps in the
                    world. Insatiable moneygrubbers, that’s to say, compared with whom you are a
                    sheep.</p>
                <p>Please don’t take this as an insult, brother, that I make this comparison. It’s
                    better to be a sheep than a wolf, it’s better to be the one who is killed than
                    the one who kills — namely better to be Abel than Cain. And — and — I myself am
                    not a wolf either, I hope, or rather I know.</p>
                <p>Suppose that both you and I are ‘sheep’ in society, not in our imaginations but
                    in truth. Very well — given fairly hungry and vicious wolves — it wouldn’t be
                    beyond the bounds of possibility that we’d be gobbled up. Well, even then,
                    although I don’t think this would be exactly pleasant, in short it’s surely
                    still better after all to be ruined than to ruin someone else. I mean, it’s no
                    reason to lose one’s serenity if one should realize that one might have to lead
                    a life of poverty while one had the skills, the talents, the aptitude with which
                    others grow rich. I’m not indifferent to money, but I don’t envy the wolves.
                    Now, with a hearty handshake.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>It’s still early; I wanted to add a word or two to my letter of yesterday in
                    order to try to make a few things clearer to you. But I ask you to regard what I
                    tell you in this letter as something I would keep silent about if I didn’t think
                    I could rely on your discretion and intelligence.</p>
                <p>I haven’t said a word to Pa and Ma about the real question of two years ago. I
                    have, though, spoken about a side issue at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="family">For their part, Pa and Ma don’t even mention her name.
                        Very well — they don’t have to speak to me about it, nor I to them. I did
                        touch on it indirectly, though; I told Pa that in my view it was a great
                        mistake that at a certain point (two years ago) I was forced to leave the
                        house.</stress>
                    <stress reason="money">I said that not only had considerable financial harm been
                        the consequence, but also that, driven to the limit, I had been forced to go
                        to extremes much more, to much greater intransigence than I would have
                        displayed of my own free will alone.</stress> I pointed to the example of
                    the Rappard family in contrast to the Van Gogh family. I pointed out how Rappard
                    also has differences with his father about this or that, but that they always
                    avoid extremes not only for the world but also for themselves and, although he
                    doesn’t earn a penny from his work (which is nonetheless very sound, very fine
                    even), Rappard can still always face the world with dignity, also in so far as
                    equipment and studio &amp;c. are concerned. And how the family makes sure there
                    are no debts anywhere with colourmen &amp;c. I told Pa how noble, how stalwart
                    and how clearsighted I thought it was of you, Theo, that you’ve always helped me
                    in so far as it was at all possible for you. <stress reason="family">I pointed
                        out how, if Pa hadn’t been so steely and obstinate and in short
                        unintelligent then, your help would have been effective, whereas now your
                        help wasn’t effective and we’ve only half succeeded.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>So to that extent I certainly did touch on the past. <stress reason="family">At
                        the same time I pointed out that at this moment it’s again difficult for me
                        to avoid extremes, since the relationship to the family in general in which
                        I feel I stand is so bad that it’s becoming clear to me that the bond
                        between you and me cannot endure if everything is always just left as it is.
                        That when I think about whether it’s right or wrong to accept money from
                        you, I have to take appearances into consideration.I tell you frankly that I
                        find the spirit in our family, particularly Pa’s and also, for instance,
                        C.M.’s, more and more wrong.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>My position visàvis you now is this: on the one hand I believe that there’s still
                    a possibility that your character, like mine, will go back on many of the things
                    we were taught; yes, I say, I think it possible that you’ll have a change of
                    heart, be it gradual, be it sudden, so that you’ll find yourself compelled to
                    adopt another outlook on life, and that perhaps the upshot will be that you’ll
                    yet become a painter.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, this is in stark contrast, for example, to what you said this
                    summer: ‘I’m becoming more and more like Pa’.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="family">In the event of this last — that is, that you became
                        more and more a ‘Van Gogh’, became a character like Pa or C.M. and by always
                        being involved in business acquired an outlook on life entirely different
                        from mine — a trader’s spirit, that is became a more or less political
                        person — well, to be quite frank, then I’d rather not be intimate with you,
                        then I’d find it better that, rather than strengthening bonds, we should let
                        each other go, understanding we didn’t belong together.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>At present I’m observing Pa — I see, I hear, I feel what Pa is — and I don’t like
                    it — decidedly not. If you are thus, if you’re becoming more and more thus —
                    then it’s wise to part. Now I return to what I said to Pa, that it was a mistake
                    that we quarrelled so seriously two years ago that the house has been barred to
                    me since then — (whose fault it was doesn’t even matter that much; it would have
                    been in accordance with Pa’s own principles — if he had maintained them
                    consistently — that the quarrel itself should have been avoided — avoided come
                    what may). What does Pa say to this? Yes, but I can’t take back anything I did
                    then, I’ve always done everything for your own good, and I’ve always acted on my
                    sincere opinion. To which I replied that a person’s ‘opinion’ may sometimes be
                    diametrically opposed to his conscience, I mean what one THINKS one should do
                    and what one ought to do may be diametrically opposed to one another. I told Pa
                    that terms may be found in the Bible itself to judge whether our ‘opinions’ are
                    fair and just.</p>
                <p>And that Pa was all too much in the habit of failing to do this and going on
                    hotheadedly — in my view very unjustly, very arbitrarily, very reprehensibly —
                    according to his ‘opinion’ — not — according to his conscience.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="family">Enough, so I was faced with an iron barrier of
                        irreconcilability indeed, although Pa tried to mask it, tried to lead me
                        around it and to divert me from pursuing it. But I didn’t allow myself to be
                        put off by this, and said — Pa, this is about your selfrighteousness, which
                        was and is fatal for you and for me. Then Pa said, ‘did you think I would go
                        down on my knees to you?’ I said I took it very ill of Pa, thought it
                        extremely crude, that Pa saw only that in it, and that I wouldn’t waste my
                        breath on it any longer. Pa doesn’t have to tell me that he acted badly
                        towards me, but Pa should have learnt what I learnt in those two years —
                        that it was a great mistake in itself, and that it should have been
                        redressed immediately without asking whose fault it was. So brother, in my
                        view Pa eternally descends into pettymindedness instead of being more open,
                        more liberal, broader, more humane. It was minister’s vanity that drove
                        things to extremes then, and it’s still the same minister’s vanity that will
                        still cause more mischief in the present and the future.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>I don’t ask you to intercede, I ask you for something more personal, I ask you
                    frankly: how do we stand towards each other; are you a ‘Van Gogh’ too?</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="family">I always regarded you as ‘Theo’. In character I’m quite
                        different from the various members of the family, and I’m actually not a
                        ‘Van Gogh’. But if you were to become a personality — played a part in the
                        world like Pa or C.M. or Uncle V. even, very well, I wouldn’t interfere with
                        that, I would accept you as you were, I would keep silent about it, but our
                        paths would diverge too greatly for me to be able to continue regarding the
                        financial tie advisable, as it stands now.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>I hope you’ll understand me. If not, we’ll have to give it time. Who knows if, in
                    the next 3 years, you won’t start to view some questions more or less as I do.
                    Why? Because you’ll also be influenced by art and by mixing with artists, and in
                    short may perhaps become squarer and broader in consequence instead of narrower
                    and more constricted.</p>
                <p>Well old chap — if you can, see to it that I can get away from here — regards and
                    believe me</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="money">Yesterday evening I received your letter and the 100
                        francs enclosed. I can tell you that I’m now at a point where I can cover my
                        deficit of last year, having had fewer expenses because of my stay
                        here.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>I point this out to you so that you can see from it how I dislike disorderliness
                    in affairs as much as you do, and also insist on meeting my obligations to
                    people.</p>
                <p>And am in no mood to be indifferent to affairs — — on the contrary — that I
                    assure you.</p>
                <p>I’ll indeed really try to carry on with my work, and you mustn’t think that I’m
                    any different from before as regards working every day here.</p>
                <p>All’s well that ends well, says the proverb.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="family">Now, as to qualms I wrote to you about, concerning
                        continuing to accept money from you on the same footing, we can stop now at
                        a moment when I can come away without a deficit; all the more reason that I
                        cannot and will not do other than regard the way you’ve dealt with me
                        financially as generous. And if I had a deficit at the end of the year, I
                        also in no way pretend that this was your fault.</unstress>
                    <good_health>I say, however, that I’m glad that now, at this moment, there’s
                        nothing unpaid to suppliers.</good_health>
                    <unstress reason="money">I’ve honestly dealt with and paid suppliers of paint or
                        whatever else.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="money">I owe a great debt to you, though, and I would make it
                        worse and worse were I to continue on exactly the same footing.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>Now I have a proposal to make for the future. Let me send you my work and you
                    take what you want from it, but I insist that I may consider the money I would
                    receive from you after March as money I’ve earned. And I don’t mind at all if
                    it’s not as much at first as I’ve been receiving up to now.</p>
                <p>For my part I say decidedly that, whatever you may think about what I’ve received
                    from you so far, for myself I consider it as something that I’ll repay if
                    possible. If things work out, I really will pay it off. There can be no question
                    of that for the present, and so we won’t mention it.</p>
                <p>
                    <work mention="vague">Towards March I’ll send you some watercolours from here.
                        I’ll take them to somebody else if you don’t want them, but I’d rather do
                        business with you. These watercolours will have errors, but still, I don’t
                        think it’s foolish of me if I make a start on getting my work seen in order
                        to send it into the world.</work> Rappard did the same at a certain point,
                    and carried it through from the moment he started it. As for me, I do it rather
                    reluctantly, but I must do it.</p>
                <p>And from March onwards I’ll start to send work here and there regularly. And to
                    you first — but don’t consider yourself obliged to take something from me if you
                    don’t really care for it yourself. I should think that this would mean that,
                    however much our feelings may differ or come to differ, we wouldn’t even have to
                    talk about it, much less quarrel.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="family">Which in my view one does have to do if one has a
                        relationship with someone such as ours has been up to now.I repeat, I’d have
                        qualms about continuing on the same footing.</stress>
                    <unstress reason="family">But I’d very willingly continue relations with you in
                        a somewhat altered manner.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>I’m not even saying that I want you to consider immediately that anything you
                    might take from me is something that you’ll try to sell.</p>
                <p>If, for the time being, you take work from me not so much in your capacity as a
                    dealer but more in your capacity of having it in your heart to do something
                    precisely for people like me, who are just setting out, that’s enough for me.
                        <stress reason="money">But after March I don’t want to take money from you,
                        or at least absolutely as little as possible, for which I haven’t supplied
                        specific work.</stress>
                    <unstress reason="money">I couldn’t continue on the same footing with enthusiasm
                        — but I’ll start on that other with enthusiasm the moment I believe that the
                        former has to be cut off.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>If you don’t want to enter into that other proposal, then you must leave it.</p>
                <p>I do want to be free with you, but at the same time I want you to feel you’re
                    equally free with me. If there’s something in my work that you like, it will
                    give me great pleasure, and if you don’t like it and you would want to stay out
                    of it, I can have nothing to say about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="family">Moreover, whatever differences in feelings there may be
                        about this or that, something that I hope really will remain is that we’re
                        brothers and will conduct ourselves as brothers.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="family">I also hope that you and Pa won’t oppose me if I don’t
                        take any studio other than the little mangle room here for the time
                        being.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>I’ll take another and no longer be in Pa’s house as soon as my work produces
                    enough for me to pay for a house again myself.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="career">I don’t think there’s been a day since I’ve been here
                        when I haven’t sat working with the weavers or peasants from morning till
                        night.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>I’ll be very pleased if you approve of my proposal. Then, in my view, we’ll avoid
                    extremes and steer a steady course. If you know of something better, I’d like to
                    hear it. Regards, and I thank you for what you sent.</p>

            <salutation>My dear brother,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>There’s something I have to tell you in a word or two.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="family">Ma hurt her leg getting out of the train — at Helmond —
                        high up near the pelvis — in what’s called the head of the femur. I don’t
                        know whether it’s definitely a fracture or just a dislocation of the head of
                        the femur.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="family">The doctor came immediately, has set it, and has
                        assured us that there’s no immediate danger, but that it will take a long
                        time.</unstress> I didn’t speak to the doctor myself, so I don’t know
                    exactly what it is. I was there when it was set, but it went very easily,
                    relatively speaking.</p>
                <p>I give you my word that things are no worse with Ma than I’m telling you, and
                    that we’ll telegraph you should the doctor predict any danger. And I’ll send you
                    word every day. When I asked what the doctor said, Pa said it’s definitely a
                    fracture. So you know about it right away; I thought that better than to delay
                    writing to you. I’ll write to you again tomorrow once the doctor has been. With
                    a hearty handshake.</p>

                    <work mention="vague">Today I sent a parcel to your address containing 3 small
                        panels and 9 watercolours.</work> Please let me know whether you’ve received
                    it. If there’s anything in it you like, so much the better. Ma is going on much
                    the same. <work origin="existing" stage="middle">Am still working on various

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>
                    <work origin="existing" stage="finished">Just a word to tell you that — partly
                        in response to your letter in which you mentioned pen drawings — I have five
                        weavers for you which I’ve made after my painted studies and are slightly
                        different — and I think livelier — in execution than the pen drawings of
                        mine you’ve seen so far.</work>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <work origin="existing" stage="middle">I’m working on them from early till late,
                        for have also started more new watercolours of them as well as the painted
                        studies and the pen drawings.</work>
                </p>
                <p>I thought about you a lot these last few days, partly on account of a little book
                    that originally came from you and that I borrowed from Lies — the poems of
                    François Coppée. I knew only a very few by him, and they’d already struck me at
                    the time. He’s one of the true artists — who put their heart and soul into it —
                    evident from more than one painful confession. All the more an artist because
                    he’s touched by so many very different things, and is capable of painting both a
                    3rdclass waiting room full of emigrants who spend the night there — everything
                    drab and gloomy and melancholy — and yet in another mood draws a little marquise
                    who dances a minuet, as elegant as a little figure by Watteau.</p>
                <p>That absorption in the moment — that being so wholly and utterly carried away and
                    inspired by the surroundings in which one happens to be — what can one do about
                    it? And even if one could resist it if one wanted to, what would be the point,
                    why shouldn’t one give oneself over to that which is in front of one, as this,
                    after all, is the surest way to create something?</p>
                <p>I was struck by the last one in the little book, entitled Désir dans le spleen,
                    which I copy to remind you of it.</p>
                <p>Everything lives, everything loves! And I, sad and alone, Stand like a dead tree
                    against the vernal sky</p>
                <p>I can no longer love, I who have lived but thirty years,</p>
                <p>And have my mistress lately quit without regrets. </p>
                <p>I am like a sick man, his thoughts grown dull</p>
                <p>And wearying of his stale, familiar room,</p>
                <p>His sole amusement, stupid and mechanical,</p>
                <p>To count inside his head his carpet’s flowers.</p>
                <p>Sometimes I wish my end were near, And all these recollections — once so
                    sweet,</p>
                <p>I thrust away, as from the portrait of an ancestor</p>
                <p>Whose gaze disturbs us, we turn away our eye.</p>
                <p>Even of that old love, that drew so many tears,</p>
                <p>No trace remains in this, my jaded heart.</p>
                <p>O, thou figure in my thoughts, veiled and dim, Whom I may meet tomorrow, whom I
                    know not yet,</p>
                <p>A courtesan, leaning at table ’mid the remnants of a meal,</p>
                <p>Or — a woman, soberminded, eyes downcast and pale.</p>
                <p>Appear! — if yet this wretched heart, empty of desire,</p>
                <p>Its flame extinct, you can again ignite,</p>
                <p>Give me again the infinite within a woman’s glance</p>
                <p>And all of nature blooming in a kiss.</p>
                <p>Come! — As sailors on a foundering ship</p>
                <p>Throw — to win an hour’s respite — a treasure to the deep —</p>
                <p> Come! — I promise you all, heart and soul — blood and flesh, All — for but a
                    moment of faith — or yet of drunken rapture. </p>
                <p>and then this:</p>
                <p>Divine hope that two together come to form</p>
                <p>And two together share,</p>
                <p>The hope to love long, love always, love</p>
                <p>More dearly every day;</p>
                <p>Desire eternal — touching and chimerical,</p>
                <p>That lovers sigh —</p>
                <p>When — blissful moment — searching each other out,</p>
                <p>Their lips exchange a mutual breath.</p>
                <p>That vain, illusory desire, that cheating hope,</p>
                <p>Whereof we never spoke;</p>
                <p>It pains me to see we are afraid of it,</p>
                <p>Though it be in our souls.</p>
                <p>And when to your questioning I, your sweetheart,</p>
                <p>Murmur a soft response,</p>
                <p>The word is — evermore —</p>
                <p>Without my uttering it,</p>
                <p>And though its dear echo sounds within your heart,</p>
                <p>Your silence is the same</p>
                <p>When on your breast, languorous unto death,</p>
                <p>I swear I love you.</p>
                <p>What signifies the past — what of time to come?</p>
                <p>For what is best of all,</p>
                <p>Is to believe that it should never end,</p>
                <p>That hour’s illusion.</p>
                <p>And when I tell you, ‘Evermore!’ — do naught</p>
                <p>That might dispel that dream,</p>
                <p>And may your kiss on mine</p>
                <p>Press all the longer and more tenderly.</p>
                <p>and then this —</p>
                <p>Sorrow assuaged</p>
                <p>You whom I saw as like the blasted oak,</p>
                <p>I find you now a father, find you spouse;</p>
                <p>And yet to that brow that dreamed of death’s release,</p>
                <p>A pistol once was held.</p>
                <p>All that you cannot have forgotten quite;</p>
                <p>You knew how one suffers and despairs;</p>
                <p>You carried in your heart the viper vile Of a great love lost, a great hope —
                    crushed.</p>
                <p>Oblivion eluded you — you sought out Tumults, orgy and its songs — fame and its
                    jibes</p>
                <p>And the long roaring of the sea and of the wind.</p>
                <p>Who, then, unto your sorrow put a silent stop —</p>
                <p>O Lonesome one — ’twas but the rhythmic beat</p>
                <p> Marked by the cradle of a little child. </p>
                <p>and then this —</p>
                <p>A wound reopened</p>
                <p>O, my heart, are you then so craven and so weak?</p>
                <p>And would you be like a convict, dragging his ball and chain, Who, though
                    released, yet hobbles still?</p>
                <p>Be silent — well you know the sentence she has passed on you.</p>
                <p>I will no longer suffer, and thus I order you:</p>
                <p>If I should feel you swell once more and writhe,</p>
                <p>May I — with a stifled sob — crush you;</p>
                <p>And — no one shall know of it — and — to still my cries,</p>
                <p>They’ll see me — for that ghastly minute,</p>
                <p>Clench my teeth — just like a soldier during amputation.</p>
                <p>This is certainly poetry, and among the best — I find Désir dans le spleen, in
                    particular so true, paints how, in those very souls who are wearied and those
                    who almost fall, there arises at times that infinite renewal of desire, as if
                    they had no past behind them — I thought of Rembrandt’s Jewish bride — and what
                    Thoré says about it. Thoré (in his prime) and Theo Gautier and so many others —
                    how much has changed since them — and how much duller it’s become. If one wants
                    to preserve something of the fire in one, nowadays one must show it to others as
                    little as possible. But anyway.</p>
                <p>
                    <work mention="vague">Did you get the little consignment I sent last
                        week?</work>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <work mention="vague">I have to keep the pen drawings for another week or so
                        because I still need them to finish off other things that I started at the
                        same time.</work> But you’ll get them soon — but do please let me know
                    whether the parcel arrived safely, and whether there were enough stamps on it.
                    Because drawings possibly count as written matter and more has to be paid on
                    them.</p>
                <p>Regards — I hope you’ll be able to do something with all of this.</p>

                    <unstress reason="family">Pa already wrote to you about Ma a few days ago. All
                        remained normal since, and the doctor said today he hadn’t dared hope at the
                        beginning that it would have gone so well.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>Coppée is another one like Heine or Musset — I’ll copy out a few more.</p>
                <p>The first one</p>
                <p>It’s not that she was so beautiful,</p>

                <p>It’s not that she had a tender heart, But it was so delightful</p>
                <p>To talk to her, to listen to her speak,</p>
                <p>My eyes would fill with tears.</p>
                <p>It’s not that her soul was hard,</p>
                <p>But all the same, she left me (or perhaps, I left her) From then my sadness takes
                    its date,</p>
                <p>And will continue, everlastingly.</p>
                <p>The lost dog.</p>
                <p>When we go home, at night, through empty city streets,</p>
                <p>And see upon the wet, green, greasy mud</p>
                <p>Long streaks of gaslight, more of them every day,</p>
                <p>Often a stray dog with matted coat, a dreadful, doleful sight,</p>
                <p>An old dog from hereabouts, which its master, penniless,</p>
                <p>Has thrown out with a kick — perhaps mourning it —</p>
                <p>Will stick its stubborn nose into your heels,</p>
                <p>And if you should turn back, give you a look,</p>
                <p>And what a look — long, fearful, all cajolery,</p>
                <p>A mistress’s, a poor man’s touching gaze,</p>
                <p>Yet hopeless, with that uncertain air belonging to</p>
                <p>A woman scorned and a poor man who feels his shame.</p>
                <p>And if you stop, he’ll stop with you, and</p>
                <p>Feebly wag his wet and drooping tail, Timid, knowing his fate lies in your
                    hands.</p>
                <p>He seems to say: ‘Come on — take me with you — please?’</p>
                <p>We’re moved — and yet we don’t quite dare;</p>
                <p>We’re poor ourselves — and rabies is a fearful thing.</p>
                <p>And then — unkindly — making as if to raise</p>
                <p>Our stick — we tell the dog: ‘Go on, be off with you!’</p>
                <p>And — all contrite — he goes to plead his cause elsewhere.</p>
                <p>This also applies to art.</p>
                <p> Illomened meeting! and what times are these,</p>
                <p> These savage Prussians (‘decent people — too wellfed people’ something like
                    that),</p>
                <p> what they have done to us</p>
                <p> That the poorest folk now cast their dogs aside,</p>
                <p> And when, distracted from the public show of grief, we must yet</p>
                <p> Pity these animals — who turn upon us their imploring gaze.</p>
                <p>To a Second lieutenant.</p>
                <p>You carry, my handsome officer,</p>
                <p>With perfect grace,</p>
                <p>Your sword with hilt of steel,</p>
                <p>But I think of our defeat.</p>
                <p>This pelisse of finest stuff</p>
                <p>Sets off your figure perfectly;</p>
                <p>You’re charming; but after all</p>
                <p>We lost the battle.</p>
                <p>We read your intrepidity</p>
                <p>In your black eyes under their slender brows.</p>
                <p>Nothing wrong with wearing fancy gloves —</p>
                <p>But, they took two provinces from us.</p>
                <p>At your age one’s always proud</p>
                <p>Of a little bit of braid;</p>
                <p>But — do you see — ’twas yesterday</p>
                <p>They maimed our motherland.</p>
                <p>Lieutenant, I do not know</p>
                <p>If of an evening, a finger to your brow,</p>
                <p>Holding book and compasses,</p>
                <p>You stay up late, beside the lamp.</p>
                <p>Are your men your children?</p>
                <p>Are you their leader and their father?</p>
                <p>I wish to believe that, and would fight off</p>
                <p>A doubt that fills me with despair.</p>
                <p>Stripes on your sleeve, on your way, Is it of deliverance you think?</p>
                <p>— Young man, give me your hand,</p>
                <p>Let’s give a little shout — ‘Vive la France!’</p>
                <p>A woman alone.</p>
                <p>I met her in a bourgeois drawingroom –</p>
                <p>Her gentle, timorous eyes, her banished angel’s brow,</p>
                <p>First drew me to her – and I was told</p>
                <p>She’d separated from a brutal spouse.</p>
                <p>Still she kept company with those old friends</p>
                <p>Whose home had known her as a growing child</p>
                <p>And who, despite the talk that makes folk take offence,</p>
                <p>Cared not a jot for all their cruel prejudice.</p>
                <p>But she knew well enough – sweet and resigned –</p>
                <p>That wider circles were all barred to her, Ever expecting – quiet and calm –</p>
                <p>The word that snubs, the greeting that rebuffs.</p>
                <p>And so, on evenings when they neither dined nor danced,</p>
                <p>She’d come and broider there among them, by the hearth,</p>
                <p>And there it was (seeing her so fresh and young)</p>
                <p>I was amazed to see she wore a wedding ring.</p>
                <p>Stoical, accepting of her curious widowhood</p>
                <p>Without a backward thought; naively, too,</p>
                <p>To show she kept her faithful vows,</p>
                <p>Her hand retained enslavement’s evidence.</p>
                <p>Darkhaired and pale she was – twentyfive years old –</p>
                <p>Her long, proud hands were veined with blue</p>
                <p>And the long lashes fringing her chaste eyes</p>
                <p>Cast fluttering veils across her nutbrown gaze.</p>
                <p>No gem, no ribbon, not a hint of gaiety,</p>
                <p>Never the smallest flower inserted in the chestnutcoloured band,</p>
                <p>The little collar – white and demure –</p>
                <p>Stood out alone against her dress of mourning silk.</p>
                <p>Sewing there, unhurried, with an easy hand,</p>
                <p>Confident of shadow’s power to transform,</p>
                <p>She kept the darkest corner of the room;</p>
                <p>She scarcely spoke, and wished to be forgot.</p>
                <p>But when she answered with a casual word or two</p>
                <p>The humdrum questions that were put to her,</p>
                <p>Painful it was to hear that voice,</p>
                <p>Broken by suffering and made for tenderness.</p>
                <p>That pure, slow voice, weary from prayer,</p>
                <p>Once interrupted by a master’s powerful tones,</p>
                <p>And forced, perhaps, to cry aloud from fear and shame</p>
                <p>By insults, or an arm upraised.</p>
                <p>And when a little child went round the company</p>
                <p>Offering its forehead to receive a kiss, how ling’ringly,</p>
                <p>With what a keen and melancholy pang</p>
                <p>She placed her lips upon the flaxen head.</p>
                <p>But straight upon this all too cruel delight</p>
                <p>How quick she was to take her needle up again!</p>
                <p>And what a sudden blush spread o’er her cheek,</p>
                <p>Conscious of regrets made palpable.</p>
                <p>For I could see, kindly though we were,</p>
                <p>That she was pitied for her miserable choice;</p>
                <p>That this community, timid, respectable,</p>
                <p>Retained its fear – quite natural, I’d say.</p>
                <p>Clearly I observed her humble gaze</p>
                <p>Falter if it should meet a sparkling eye,</p>
                <p>How she avoided all the younger girls,</p>
                <p>And looked none but the old men in the face.</p>
                <p>Young man, who could love this unhappy one –</p>
                <p>Your paths will surely cross some day –</p>
                <p>Don’t look at her, say not a word to her,</p>
                <p>Don’t let her love you, that would be unspeakable!</p>
                <p>Look, I know the skill, the subtle wiles</p>
                <p>Of sophistry as well as you.</p>
                <p>I know its piercing eye, its voice that penetrates, And how the blood will surge
                    through your rebellious veins.</p>
                <p>I know that quite defenceless, she succumbs,</p>
                <p>I know she beats her breast before the Cross,</p>
                <p>That she’d adore you like a god, or like a son;</p>
                <p>I know your triumph is assured.</p>
                <p>Yes, I’m sure for you she’d sacrifice</p>
                <p>Her only treasure – honour, faithful, pure.</p>
                <p>And that you’d gladly live and die with her.</p>
                <p>That’s fine. But equally, I know ‘twould be the death of her.</p>
                <p>Sadly</p>
                <p>Obsessed by these words, widowhood and autumn,</p>
                <p>My reverie seeks no other to express</p>
                <p>This melancholy, vast and monotonous,</p>
                <p>That robs me of all hope and all desire to love.</p>
                <p>Ceaselessly it evokes a long, long avenue</p>
                <p>Of plane trees, immensely tall, half bare,</p>
                <p>In which a woman in deep mourning, veiled,</p>
                <p>Moves slowly forward on the pallid grass.</p>
                <p>Her long skirts leave behind a wake,</p>
                <p>Trailing and rustling in the fallen leaves;</p>
                <p>She follows with her gaze the passage of a cloud</p>
                <p>Before the wind, driving from the north, already cold.</p>
                <p>She thinks of him, now absent, who was wont to say: I love you!</p>
                <p>And under the wide low sky from which the light has gone,</p>
                <p>Sees that, with the last chrysanthemum, yesterday</p>
                <p>The last butterfly has also died.</p>
                <p>And so she walks across the faded grass,</p>
                <p>Weary of wishing, weary of submitting,</p>
                <p>And always in her path, the planetree leaves</p>
                <p>Fall with a sound as sad as sighs.</p>
                <p>— In vain — to chase away these gloomy images</p>
                <p>Do I call up my youth, and that splendid summer.</p>
                <p>I do not trust the sun, no more believe the roses,</p>
                <p>And go about, head lowered, like a haunted man.</p>
                <p>My heart’s so full of autumn and of widowhood</p>
                <p>That I forever dream, under a pure, clear sky —</p>
                <p>Of one in mourning — in a chill landscape,</p>
                <p>And the leaves falling at first winter’s wind.</p>
            </ps>

        <letter>
            <head>
                <location>Nuenen</location>, on or about Sunday, <date>2 March 1884</date>.</head>
            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Thanks for your letter — Ma’s doing well — at the outset the doctor said it would
                    be six months before the leg had healed — now he’s talking about a good 3 months
                    — and he said to Ma — ‘but that’s your daughter’s fault, for I seldom, very
                    seldom, see such good care as she gives’. What Wil does is exemplary, exemplary,
                    I shan’t easily forget that.</p>
                <p>Almost everything has fallen on her shoulders from the outset, and she’s spared
                    Ma a great deal of misery.</p>
                <p>To mention just one thing, it’s definitely her fault that Ma has so few bedsores
                    (which started very badly at the beginning and had deteriorated). And I assure
                    you that the chores she has to do aren’t always pleasant.</p>
                <p>Now listen — when I’d read your letter about the drawings, I immediately sent you
                        <work origin="new" stage="finished">a new watercolour of a weaver</work> and
                        <work stage="finished" origin="existing">five pen drawings</work>. <stress
                        reason="career">For my part, too, I’ll tell you frankly that I think that
                        what you say is true, that my work will have to get much better,</stress>
                    but at the same time also that your efforts to do something with it might also
                    be a little more decisive. <stress reason="family">You have never yet sold a
                        single thing of mine — not for a lot or a little — and IN FACT HAVEN’T TRIED
                        TO YET. As you can see, I’m not getting angry about it — but — there’s no
                        need to beat about the bush. I certainly wouldn’t put up with it in the long
                        run.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>For your part, you can also continue to speak frankly.</p>
                <p>As far as saleability and unsaleability are concerned, that’s an old file I don’t
                    intend to blunt my teeth on.</p>
                <p>Well, you see that my answer is that I send some new ones — and I’ll very
                    willingly go on doing so — Id like nothing better than that. Only you must be
                    totally frank for once — which is what I’d prefer — as to whether you think
                    you’ll bother yourself with them in the future, or whether your dignity won’t
                    permit it. Leaving aside the past — I’m facing the future, and not counting what
                    you think of them, I fully intend to try to do something with them.</p>
                <p>You recently told me yourself that you’re a dealer — very well — one doesn’t
                    lapse into sentimentality with a dealer; one says, sir, if I give you drawings
                    on commission, may I count on your showing them? The dealer has to decide for
                    himself whether he wants to say yes — no — or something in between.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="career">But the painter would be foolish to send them on
                        commission if he could tell that the dealer considered his work to be
                        something that shouldn’t see the light of day.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>Now, old chap — we both live in the real world — and precisely because we don’t
                    want to put a spoke in each other’s wheels, we must speak candidly. If you say —
                    I can’t be bothered with them — very well, I won’t get angry about it — but then
                    I’m not obliged to believe that you’re an absolute oracle either, am I?</p>
                <p>You say: the public will be annoyed by this little spot. Now listen, that may be
                    so, but this or that bothers you, the dealer, much more than the public in
                    question, I’ve already remarked on that so often — and you start with that. I
                    have to fight my way through, too, Theo, and with you I’m still at precisely,
                    precisely the same level as a few years ago. What you say of my current work —
                    ‘it is almost saleable but’ — is word for word the same as what you wrote to me
                    when I sent you my first Brabant sketches from Etten. So I say — it’s an old
                    file. And my reasoning is that I foresee that you’ll always say the same thing —
                    and that <stress reason="career">I, who until today have been consistently
                        rather chary of making approaches to dealers, will now change tactics and
                        become very assiduous in trying to sell my work.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <bad_health>I do understand that you couldn’t care less about my doings. But if
                        you couldn’t care less, for my part I always find it fairly wretched and
                        rather dread things that will probably crop up — namely that people will ask
                        me: what, don’t you do business with your brother or with Goupil? Well, then
                        I’ll say — it’s beneath the dignity of those Messrs Gie, Van Gogh Co. This
                        will probably create a bad impression of me — which I’m quite prepared for —
                        but which I foresee will consequently make me cooler and cooler towards you
                        too</bad_health>.</p>
                <p>
                    <work origin="new" stage="finished">I’ve now painted the little old church and
                        another new weaver.</work> Are the studies from Drenthe really so very bad?
                    I don’t feel inclined to send you the painted studies from here, no, let’s not
                    start on that — you can see them if you come here sometime in the spring,
                    perhaps.</p>
                <p>What you write about Marie is quite understandable — if a woman isn’t very milk
                    and water I can very well imagine that she has little inclination to mope around
                    with cantankerous fathers and pious sisters, at least a woman as much as a man
                    would feel a fairly pressing temptation to end that stagnation, come what
                    may.</p>
                <p>Stagnation that begins with a resignation that is perhaps fine in itself, but
                    which alas one must come to regret, usually, when one feels one would eventually
                    freeze. Read something by Daudet about pious women, ‘Those two faces looked at
                    each other — they exchanged a spiteful, cold, closed look — what’s the matter
                    with him/her? Always the same thing’. There you have it, that singular look of
                    Pharisees and devout ladies. Yes, therefore we always lack — the same thing. Yes
                    — what am I supposed to think about what you say about my work? For example,
                        <work stage="finished" origin="existing">I’ll now turn specifically to the
                        studies from Drenthe — there are some among them that are very superficial,
                        I said that myself — but what do I get served up for the ones that were
                        simply painted quietly and calmly outdoors, trying to say nothing in them
                        but what I saw? </work>I get in return: aren’t you too preoccupied with
                    Michel? (I’m talking here about the study of the little hut in the dark and
                    about the largest of the sod huts, namely the one with the little green field in
                    the foreground.) You would certainly say exactly the same thing about the little
                    old churchyard.</p>
                <p>And yet, neither looking at the little churchyard nor at the sod huts did I think
                    about Michel, I thought about the subject I was looking at. A subject indeed
                    such that I believe, if Michel had passed by, it would have brought him to a
                    halt and struck him.</p>
                <p>For my part, I certainly don’t put myself on a par with master Michel — but I
                    definitely don’t therefore imitate Michel either.</p>
                <p>Well, I may perhaps try to sell something in Antwerp, and I’d like to put a
                    couple of those selfsame Drenthe studies in black wooden frames — which I’m
                    looking for at a carpenter’s here — I prefer to see my work in a deep black
                    frame, and he makes them cheaply enough. You mustn’t take it amiss that I
                    mention it, brother.</p>
                <p>I’m seeking something calm and something cool in my work. No more than I approve
                    of its just lying about, do I want my work to be displayed in fluted frames in
                    the leading galleries, you see. <stress reason="family">And now it’s time to
                        begin on that middle way, in my view, and I have to know fairly definitely
                        how I stand with you, or rather I tell you that, although you’re still
                        evading the issue in what you say, I believe that you will not in fact show
                        it. And I don’t even believe that you’ll change your mind for the time
                        being.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>Whether you’re right or wrong about this — I’m not going into that. You’ll tell
                    me that I’ll be treated by other dealers exactly the same as by you, except
                    that, <stress reason="money">although you can’t be bothered with my work, you
                        furnish me with money anyway, and other dealers certainly won’t do that, and
                        without money I’ll become completely stuck.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>I say in reply that things aren’t as clearcut as that in real life, and that I’ll
                    see how far I get living from day to day. I told you beforehand that I wanted to
                    settle these matters this month, and so it must be done.<stress reason="career">
                        Well, because you probably plan to come as early as the spring I don’t
                        insist that you make a final decision immediately, but realize that I can’t
                        accept it as it is now — for myself, wherever I go and especially at home,
                        too, I’m always being watched — what I do with my work, whether I get
                        anything for it and, in short in society almost everyone looks out for it
                        all the time and wants to know all about it.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>And this is very understandable. Well, it’s very wretched for me always being in
                    a false position.</p>
                <p>Come on — things can’t stay the same as they are now. Why not? Because they
                    can’t.</p>
                <p>If I’m as cool as can be to Pa — to C.M. — why should I behave any differently
                    towards you were I to observe in you precisely the same tactics of never
                    speaking out. Do I consider myself better than Pa or you? Perhaps not, perhaps I
                    divide things less and less into good and bad — but I do know that these tactics
                    don’t befit a painter and that, as a painter, one must speak out and resolve
                    certain things. In short — I believe that a door should either be open or
                    shut.</p>
                <p>Well, I think you do understand that a dealer cannot be neutral towards painters
                    — that it makes exactly the same impression whether you say no with or without
                    mincing your words, and that it may be even more infuriating when it’s said
                    wrapped up in compliments.</p>
                <p>Now here’s something that you’ll perhaps understand later on better than you do
                    now — I pity dealers when they get old — even if they’ve already made their
                    piles — that doesn’t solve everything — at least not then. Everything has its
                    price, and an icecold wilderness is what it often becomes for them then.</p>
                <p>Well — but you’ll perhaps think differently about it. And you’ll say that it’s
                    also pretty sad when a painter dies miserably in a hospital and is buried with
                    the whores in the common grave — where a lot of them lie, after all —
                        <bad_health>particularly when one considers that dying may not be as
                        difficult as living.</bad_health>
                </p>
                <p>Well, one can’t take it amiss that a dealer doesn’t always have the money to
                    help, but one can, in my view, take it amiss if one notices that this
                    respectable dealer or that speaks very cordially, but he’s ashamed of me in his
                    heart and he completely ignores my work. <stress reason="career">So frankly, I
                        won’t take it amiss if you say straight out that you don’t think my work is
                        good enough or that there are, moreover, yet other reasons why you can’t be
                        bothered with it, but if you leave it in a corner somewhere and you don’t
                        show it, this isn’t kind if it’s accompanied by the assurance — WHICH IS NOT
                        LIKELY — that you yourself see something in it. I don’t believe that — you
                        mean practically none of it. And precisely because you say yourself that you
                        know my work better than anyone else, I may assume that you must think very
                        badly of it indeed if you don’t want to soil your hands with it. Why should
                        I force myself on you?</stress> Well, regards.</p>
            </body>
            <close>Yours truly,</close>
            <sig>Vincent</sig>
            <ps>
                <p>
                    <bad_health>Apart from a few years which I find hard to understand myself, when
                        I was confused by religious ideas — by a sort of mysticism — leaving aside
                        that period, I’ve always lived with a certain warmth. Now it’s all becoming
                        bleaker and colder and duller around me. </bad_health>And when I tell you
                    that in the first place I WILL not stand it like this, never mind whether or not
                    I can, I refer to what I said right at the very beginning of our relationship.
                    What I’ve had against you in the last year is a sort of relapse into cold
                    decency, which I find sterile and of no use to one — diametrically opposed to
                    everything that is action, especially to everything that is artistic. </p>
                <p> I say it as I see it, not to make you wretched but to get you to see and feel if
                    possible the reason that I no longer think of you as a brother and friend with
                    the same pleasure as before. There has to be more zest in my life if I want to
                    get more brio into my brush — I won’t get a hair’s breadth further by exercising
                    patience. If, for your part, you relapse into the abovementioned, don’t then
                    take it amiss if I’m not the same towards you as I was in the first year, say.
                    About my drawings — at this moment it seems to me that <work stage="finished"
                        origin="existing">the watercolours, the pen drawings of the weavers,</work>
                    <work origin="new" stage="middle">the latest pen drawings I’m working on
                        now,</work> aren’t so dull on the whole that they’re nothing at all. But if
                    I come to the conclusion: they’re no good, and Theo is right not to show them to
                    anyone — then — then — it will be all the more proof that I have good reason to
                    dislike our present false position, and will try all the more to change, come
                    what may — better or worse, but not the same. Now if I saw that, if you didn’t
                    think I’d improved enough, you did something about it to get me further along by
                    introducing me to another capable painter, for instance, because Mauve has
                    dropped out, or anyway something, some sign or other that proved to me that you
                    really believed in my progress or promoted it. <stress reason="money">But no,
                        there’s — yes, the money — but otherwise nothing except that ‘just keep on
                        working’, ‘be patient’ — as cold, as dead, as arid and as insufferable, just
                        as if, for instance, Pa said it. I can’t live on that — it’s too lonely, too
                        cold, too empty and too lacklustre for me.</stress>
                </p>
                <p> I’m no better than anyone else, in so far as I have my needs and desires like
                    everyone, and it’s very understandable that one reacts knowing for sure that one
                    is really being kept dangling, in the dark. </p>
                <p> If one goes from bad to worse — this wouldn’t be impossible in my case — what
                    would it matter? If one is badly off, one has to take a chance of making things
                    better. </p>
                <p> Brother — I really must remind you of how I was at the very beginning of what we
                    began. <stress reason="love">Right from the outset I’ve talked to you about the
                        question of women. I still recall that I took you to the station in
                        Roosendaal in the first year, and that I said to you then that I was so
                        against being alone that I would rather be with a common whore than
                        alone</stress>. Perhaps you remember that. I found the idea that our
                    relationship might not last almost unbearable at first. And I so very much
                    wished that it had been simple to change things. However I can’t always keep on
                    fooling myself that this can be done against the grain. </p>
                <p> The depression about it has thus been one of the reasons I wrote to you so
                    assertively from Drenthe, become a painter yet. Which cooled off immediately
                    when I saw that your dissatisfaction about business matters vanished when you
                    were on better terms with Goupil again. </p>
                <p> At first I thought it was only half sincere — then later, and now, still, I
                    think it very understandable and think it more a mistake on my part that I wrote
                    to you, become a painter, than on yours that you resumed your affairs with
                    enthusiasm when they became more possible to resume and the machinations making
                    it impossible for you ceased. </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="career">What remains, though, is that I still feel depressed by
                        the falseness of the position between us. At this moment it’s more important
                        for me to sell for 5 guilders than to receive 10 guilders by way of
                        patronage. </stress>Well, you repeatedly write, actually most definitely,
                    that you haven’t made, aren’t making, nor believe for the present you’re able to
                    make the least or slightest effort for my work; first, not as a dealer (I let
                    that pass, and at least don’t take it amiss of you) but, secondly, not in
                    private either (and that I do take somewhat amiss of you). In this case I
                    mustn’t sit doing nothing or be a funker,<stress reason="family"> so straight
                        out, if you do nothing with my work, I don’t want your patronage. I state
                        the reason plainly and I’ll state it precisely the same way, when giving a
                        reason for it is hard to avoid.</stress>
                </p>
                <p> So it isn’t that I want to ignore or belittle your help from the start until
                    now. It’s a matter of my seeing more benefit in even the poorest, most wretched
                    muddling along than in patronage (which it’s degenerating into). </p>
                <p> One can’t do without it at the very, very beginning, but now I must for God’s
                    sake, God knows how, just start muddling along rather than acquiesce in
                    something that would take us no further anyway. Brotherly or not brotherly, if
                    you can do nothing other than absolutely the financial alone, you might as well
                    keep that too. As it has been in the last year, I almost dare to say, it was
                    confined solely to money. </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="love">And although you say you give me a completely free hand,
                        it seemed to me, at bottom, that if I do this or that with a woman, for
                        instance, that you and others don’t approve of (perhaps rightly disapprove
                        of, but sometimes I don’t give a damn about that), there comes one of those
                        little tugs on the pursestrings just to make me feel that it’s ‘in my
                        interest’ to go along with your opinion.</stress>
                </p>
                <p> So you got your way regarding the woman, and it was finished, but — — — — — —
                    what damn good is it to me to get a bit of money if it means I have to practise
                    morality? Yet in itself I don’t think it something absurd in you when you
                    disapproved this summer of my still wanting to go through with it. But I can
                    foresee the following in the future: <stress reason="love">I’ll have another
                        relationship in what you people call the lower orders — and again, if I
                        still have a relationship with you, meet the same opposition. Opposition
                        that you people could only carry through with any semblance of fairness if I
                        received so much from you that I could do something different.</stress>
                    Which you don’t give and can’t or won’t give, after all — neither you, nor Pa,
                    nor C.M. or the rest, who are always first off the mark to disapprove of this or
                    that — and which I don’t after all want from you either, since I don’t give much
                    thought to the lower or upper orders. </p>
                <p> Do you see why it wasn’t an irresponsible action on my part, and wouldn’t be if
                    I were to try it again? </p>
                <p>
                    <bad_health> Because first I don’t have any pretension, don’t feel any desire at
                        all, and secondly don’t receive the means from anyone whatsoever, or earn
                        them, to keep up some sort of position or whatever you call it — I consider
                        myself completely at liberty to consort with the socalled lower orders if
                        the opportunity arises.</bad_health> We’d perpetually return to the same
                    questions. </p>
                <p> Just ask yourself now if I’m alone among those in the same profession who would
                    most definitely turn down patronage if it entails obligations to maintain some
                    sort of position while the money wasn’t enough to be able to do it, so that one
                    gets into debt rather than make progress. If it could be done on the money, I
                    might perhaps not refuse to bend, any more than others do. But we’re certainly
                    not that far at present — I have a stretch of years in front of me, as you say
                    yourself, when my work will have very little commercial value. Very well — THEN
                    I WOULD RATHER FALL INTO THE HANDS OF MUDDLING ALONG and of living through hard
                    times — which I’ve done more than once — than into the hands of Messrs Van Gogh. </p>
                <p> My only regret about arguing with Pa when I did is that I didn’t do it 10 years
                    earlier. If you carry on in the footsteps of Pa and — you’ll just see how you’ll
                    gradually get annoyed — and — how you would also become annoying to certain
                    people. But those are awkward customers and, you’ll say — they’re of no
                    consequence.</p>

                1884</date>.</head>
            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>I just received your letter and the 250 francs enclosed. If I may regard your
                    letter as a reply to my proposal, I would certainly be able to accept what you
                    say. For my part I simply wish — in order to avoid correspondence, dispute — in
                    order to be able to say something when one is railed at in daily life by one
                    person or another as being ‘without means of support’ — that if I continue to
                    receive the usual from you, I may regard it as money that I’ve earned. Naturally
                    I’ll send you work every month. That work, as you say, is then your property —
                    and I completely agree with you that in that case you have every right to do
                    nothing with it — indeed, I wouldn’t even be in a position to object if you
                    thought fit to tear it up.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="money">I for my part, needing money, am obliged to accept it
                        even if someone says to me ‘I don’t want to do anything with this drawing of
                        yours or burn it, you can have this much for it’ — in the circumstances I’d
                        say — very well — give me the money — here you have my work — I want to get
                        on — in order to get on I must have money — I’m seeing to it that I get it —
                        and so — if need be, even if I really didn’t give a damn about you, as long
                        as I receive money from you each month that is useful and necessary to me
                        (without conditions that I may not do this, that or the other), I won’t
                        break the ties, and if need be I’ll put up with anything.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>This way of mine of regarding you and your money balances your way of regarding
                    me and my work — and as long as it remains in balance — I’ll accept it.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="friendship">If I receive money from you, you drawings or
                        paintings from me — and I have something to justify myself in the view of
                        society and we otherwise have nothing in common with each other, if need be
                        — don’t write or talk about anything — even then it’s enough for me for the
                        moment and I accept it completely. Even if it pleases you to tear my work up
                        or if you want to do nothing with it, or if you want to do something with
                        it, I no longer have the right to criticize as soon as, for my part, I may
                        regard it as a purchase. </stress>Be so good as to tell me which term of
                    abuse I used about your friend Braat in my letter.</p>
                <p>In my letter, as far as I know, there was nothing about Braat except that I
                    thought he was already ill in the months that I knew him at Cie in Paris. At
                    that time, as far as I can recall, I got on very well with him, and I really
                    don’t understand how you get the idea that I ‘can’t stand’ him. So many years
                    have passed, so much has changed for me in those years, that the people I knew
                    then are fairly vague and indistinct in my memory and — that I seldom if ever
                    think about them — which nobody can blame me for, I believe. But as to Braat,
                    far from my not wanting to take any special notice of him, now that you’ve
                    written about it that way, will you please assure him that my sympathies are
                    with him, as they would be with any sufferer, and that, if he happens to
                    remember me, I send my regards and wish him as much peace and serenity as one
                    may have in such a situation. Yet what good does such a wish do him — not much —
                    so, unless one is called upon to say something, one keeps such things to
                    oneself. I would ask you though, if you’ve said something to him about my having
                    written about him in the way you reproach me with, to tell him that you had only
                    seen that term of abuse in your imagination. For you definitely won’t find it in
                    my letter.</p>
                <p>You write that you had tried to answer my letters, but had left off. For my part,
                    too, I had wanted to write to you since then, but also left off.</p>
                <p>Know that if you don’t want to do anything with the work you buy from me, or tear
                    it up if need be, this will be no reason for me not to do my best in it.</p>
                <p>
                    <work origin="new" stage="finished">For this month I have some pen drawings for
                        you; in the first place the ones that are with Rappard at the moment — about
                        which I have a letter from him that he thought they were all beautiful, and
                        the sentiment in Behind the hedgerows and the Kingfisher particularly
                        beautiful.</work>
                    <work stage="finished" origin="new">Then those first 3 Winter gardens too, which
                        he was also taken with. </work>Aside from those, <work origin="new"
                        stage="finished">I have some painted studies that are your property</work> —
                    to do with just as you will — which I can send you if you wish — which, if you
                    yourself don’t care to have them, I would ask you if I might keep for a while so
                    as to work from them.</p>
                <p>
                    <work stage="finished" origin="new">One is a large weaver who is weaving a piece
                        of red cloth — the little church amidst the wheat — a view of a little old
                        village near here.</work>I’d just like to come back to your letter about my
                    drawings — the one you say I’ve interpreted utterly impossibly.</p>
                <p>I see in it first that, among the things you say, there are a few whose tenor is
                    that there were things that pleased you in the tone, in the sentiment — so much
                    the better — if you will, that gives me a good deal of pleasure.</p>
                <p>Second, in that letter there’s a comparison of the schools of Millet and
                    Lhermitte. I found what you said about Millet better and more sensitive
                    expressions than I am used to from you — this was overshadowed, however, by the
                    way you were again tired of Lhermitte, and I’d also like to say about your whole
                    argument once again, you’re splitting your hairs too thin — why didn’t you take
                    a broader view, why didn’t you feel the same enthusiasm for both (who to my mind
                    are to each other as Rembrandt is to Maes, say) without immersing yourself in
                    barren hairsplitting about who is the greater? Third, there was something that
                    was not in that letter, namely an answer to the question as to whether we’d go
                    on or not.</p>
                <p>That was the question that it was all about, and since my work depends on my
                    paint and tools (to an extent that I can’t ignore), and they in turn on whether
                    or not I receive money, I can’t possibly ascribe much usefulness to that
                    letter.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="money">It would be less impossible for me to preserve my
                        composure in our correspondence if, when you don’t have the money on the
                        date, you were to write, I haven’t got it, you’ll get it at such and such a
                        time. Now you wrote not a word in response to my saying: it surprises me
                        that I hear nothing, my having said I’d rather have it at once than later,
                        because you said that if I need it I can get the money by return. If you’d
                        written again then, I’m sorry but I haven’t got it, I shouldn’t have had to
                        get ideas into my head that you’re deliberately being lax in order to make
                        my life a bit more difficult.</stress> And — when you haven’t got it, I
                    can’t take it amiss — when you ignore — deliberately or not deliberately —
                    that’s something that I really wish you could cure yourself of, and something
                    about which one really has to get angry. What I said about doing something with
                    my work, in Antwerp, for instance, definitely is my plan. <stress reason="money"
                        >The frame of mind in which you now are about me, the frame of mind in which
                        I now am about you, is cool enough simply to ask and to reply coolly. After
                        all — leaving aside — giving a damn about each other or not — can I count on
                        its being fixed for 1 year that I’ll continue to receive the usual monthly
                        in return for supplying my work? Why I have to know this is because, if I
                        can count on it, I would take a slightly roomier studio somewhere, which I
                        need in order to be able to work with a model.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>The one I have at present has the following geographical location,and my powers
                    of imagination aren’t strong enough to think this an improvement on the
                    situation last year. This doesn’t alter the fact that, if I complain about
                    something, there appear in your letters such passages as: I (Theo) think that
                    your position is better now than last summer. Really? And I also draw the little
                    map in response to your expression ‘I’m not aware’, and I would also not be
                    content with this letter of yours if that wasn’t in it. To which I say — I don’t
                    care whether or not you’re aware that this or that isn’t quite in order, as long
                    as you just don’t ask me to walk round befuddled about it, and as long as you
                    give me the means to improve things I have no objection to your being ‘aware’ of
                    all sorts of things.</p>
                <p>I hope this letter is as cool as yours — and I thank you very much for what you
                    sent — which makes up for the rest — at least makes it such that, if I could
                    count on its continuing thus for a year, I ask nothing more of you and will
                    right gladly send you my work.</p>
                <p>And would just suggest one other small thing to you: that if I can sell something
                    in Antwerp or somewhere, I notify you of it, and it’s deducted from the 150
                    francs.</p>
                <p>I don’t write to Rappard about business matters — at least I haven’t told him
                    that latterly I haven’t been on terms with you as in the past. Just think about
                    whether it’s quite in order that you, who know Rappard, have never seen anything
                    of his work, have absolutely no idea what he’s doing — no longer take any notice
                    whatsoever of him, except perhaps by hearsay from me. Yet he’s one of the people
                    who will amount to something — with whom people will have to reckon — of whose
                    work people will have to take notice. At the time Rappard came to you and felt
                    small in your presence, you who knew so much about art. Since that year he was
                    in Paris — how immensely he has progressed — but you — haven’t you rested on
                    your laurels a bit???</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Many happy returns of the day.</p>
                <p>It really was important news in your last letter — and I think you’ll be glad
                    that the situation has at least become clearer.</p>
                <p>Am really looking forward to your next letter.</p>
                <p>As regards the work, <work origin="new" stage="middle">I’m doing a fairly large
                        painting of a weaver — the loom straight on from the front — the little
                        figure a dark little silhouette against the white wall.</work>
                    <work stage="middle" origin="existing">And at the same time also the one I
                        started in the winter, a loom on which a piece of red cloth is being woven —
                        there the loom is seen from the side. </work>
                    <work origin="new" stage="middle">I’ve also started on two others of effects on
                        the heath. And a thing with Pollard birches.</work>
                </p>
                <p>I’ll have a lot more hard graft on those looms — but in reality the things are
                    such almighty beautiful affairs — all that old oak against a greyish wall — that
                    I certainly believe it’s right that they should be painted. We must make sure
                    that we get them so that the colour and tone match with other Dutch paintings,
                    though. <work stage="planned" origin="new"> I hope to start on two more of
                        weavers soon, where the figure will appear very differently, that’s to say
                        where the weaver isn’t sitting behind it but is arranging the threads for
                        the cloth.</work> I’ve seen them weaving by lamplight in the evening, which
                    creates very Rembrandtesque effects. Nowadays they have a sort of hanging lamp —
                    but I’ve just got a little lamp from a weaverlike the one in The evening by
                    Millet, for instance. This is what they used to work by.</p>
                <p>I recently also saw coloured pieces woven in the evening — where I’ll take you
                    sometime should you come here. When I saw it, they were also just arranging the
                    threads, so dark, bowed figures against the light, which stood out against the
                    colour of the piece. Great shadows cast on the white walls by the laths and
                    beams of the loom.</p>
                <p>Regards — do write soon if you can.</p>

            <body>
                <p>
                    <good_health>I was delighted to learn from your letter to Pa and Ma that you
                        plan to go to London</good_health> on 4 Aug. and then to come on here from
                    there. I’m again looking forward very much to your arrival and to finding out
                    what you’ll think of the work that I’ve done since. <work origin="existing"
                        stage="finished">The last things I did are a couple of rather large studies
                        of oxcarts, a black ox and a red and white one.</work>

                <p>
                    <work origin="new" stage="middle">And have also been working again on the old
                        tower in the fields in the evening; I’ve made a larger study of it than my
                        previous ones — with the wheatfields around it.</work>
                </p>
                <p>Rappard sent me back the little book by Vosmaer that belongs to you — I started
                    to read it but — is it just me? — find it almighty boring and actually written
                    in an academic, sermonizing tone. Perhaps you will too when you look at it
                    again. Have you read Sapho by Daudet? <unstress reason="environment">It’s very
                        beautiful, and so vigorous, and so close to life that the female figure
                        lives, breathes, and one can hear, literally hear the voice, and forgets
                        that one is reading.</unstress>

                <p>You’ll also <work stage="finished" origin="new">see a couple more new weavers
                    </work>when you come.</p>
                <p>Nature is certainly pure here — I’m still very pleased with the studio, too.We
                    must visit some farms and weavers together when you come.</p>
                <p>Rappard’s plan is to come back again in October; he’s probably in Drenthe again
                    now.</p>
                <p>Well, I write in some haste because I’m hard at work. <good_health>I work a good
                        deal early in the morning or in the evening, and then sometimes everything
                        is so inexpressibly beautiful.</good_health>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>
                    <work origin="existing" stage="finished">Here are a couple of smaller photos of
                        the studies of which you already have the larger ones. I’m sending them
                        because — should it ever come to it — I want you to be able to show
                        something of mine.</work> Rappard is still here and will be staying for
                    another week since the work is going extraordinarily well. He’s making women
                    spinning and various studies of heads, has already made 10 studies or so, all of
                    which I consider fine.</p>
                <p>We’ve talked together quite a lot about Impressionism — I think that you would
                    classify his work as that. But here in Holland it’s hard to work out what
                    Impressionism is actually trying to say. But both he and I are greatly
                    interested in what the present aim is. And it’s certain that unexpected new
                    ideas are beginning to emerge. That paintings are once again beginning to be
                    painted in very different tone from a few years ago.</p>
                <p>
                    <work stage="finished" origin="new">The last thing I made is a rather large
                        study of an avenue of poplars with the yellow autumn leaves, where the sun
                        makes glittering patches here and there on the fallen leaves on the ground,
                        which are interspersed with the long shadows cast by the trunks. At the end
                        of the road a peasant cottage, and the blue sky above it between the autumn
                        leaves.</work>
                </p>
                <p>I think that in a year’s time — having spent that year once again painting a
                    great deal and constantly — I’ll change my manner of painting and my colour a
                    great deal, and that I’m likely to become slightly more sombre rather than
                    lighter. The spectrum of Rappard’s work has also become much lower.</p>
                <p>The heads that he’s painting at present are reminiscent in their effect of
                    certain studies of heads by Courbet, say. But it’s becoming devilish good, that
                    I can assure you.</p>
                <p>Because of one thing and another I discussed with him, it may well be that I
                    prefer to stay here and carry on working here rather than go somewhere
                        else.<good_health> As a result of his visit I’ve again got new ideas for my
                        own work, and have so many things in my head which I’d like to make that,
                        after all, I can’t easily postpone getting on with them right
                        away.</good_health>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="money">Besides, I want to settle my paint bills before the New
                        Year, and can’t afford any extra expenditure. </stress>Because if I went to
                    Antwerp I’d obviously want to do a lot of work and would need models for it,
                    which I fear would work out too dear for the moment.</p>
                <p>But in general Rappard advises me not to do it right away, but after having
                    painted here for another few months, and to try to get a piedàterre to make nude
                    studies.</p>
                <p>
                    <work origin="new" stage="middle">But I’ll be able to benefit more from Antwerp
                        if I first paint another 30 heads here — and I’m starting on those 30 heads
                        now, or rather I’ve already started with a large bust of a shepherd.</work>
                </p>
                <p>Rappard has done the same in Drenthe and on Terschelling this summer, and it has
                    helped him to make a good deal of progress.</p>
                <p>I’ve just seen a reproduction of a Lhermitte — The inn — two workmen and a woman,
                    do you know it? The last few days R. and I have been on some long excursions,
                    and visited people house by house — we’ve seen lots of beautiful things, just
                    because of the magnificent autumnal effects. And also discovered new models.
                    Perhaps a few other painters might come to this region next year. I wish they
                    would, because one shouldn’t go for too long without ever seeing any
                    painters.</p>
                <p>Well — as to that — I’ll get new acquaintances before too long in any event.</p>
                <p>Regards, from Rappard too.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="money">You’ll certainly be interested in how things stand with
                        the call to Helvoirt that Pa received. Pa told the people in Helvoirt that
                        he certainly couldn’t even consider it unless the H. stipend was brought up
                        to the level of the Nuenen stipend. And Pa writes today that they don’t seem
                        to be raising any objections to making up the difference in stipend — they
                        have to add 150 guilders to it, I believe. So although nothing has been
                        decided — given the willingness of the good natives of Helvoirt — there’s a
                        real chance that as a result of his own words Pa will have to consider it
                        very seriously. This is important to me, because I would certainly not want
                        to go to Helvoirt with them. I just wanted to tell you exactly how things
                        stand.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>These last few days, although it’s freezing quite hard here, <work origin="new"
                        stage="middle">I’ve been working outdoors on a rather large study (more than
                        1 metre) of an old water mill in Gennep, on the other side of Eindhoven. I
                        want to finish the whole thing outdoors — but it will definitely be the last
                        that I paint outdoors this year.</work> Since I wrote to you <work
                        stage="middle" origin="new">I’ve also been working on other studies — among
                        them two heads of polder workers.</work>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <good_health>I now have 3 people in Eindhoven who want to learn to paint and
                        whom I’m teaching to paint still lifes. I can safely say that I’ve
                        progressed in painting technique and in colour since your visit. And that
                        this will continue to improve, too.</good_health>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <good_health>In painting, it’s the first steps that count — it gets easier
                        later, and I have some trumps in my hand. </good_health>And I think there
                    are tricks to be taken with them. Now you know that I made an approach to Mauve
                    and Tersteeg again, to put right what happened in the past.</p>
                <p>I don’t regret that approach.</p>
                <p>But they’ve refused to have anything to do with it — ‘very definitely’ refused.
                    This doesn’t discourage me.</p>
                <p>I regard it as something like sending a painting to an exhibition and having it
                    rejected.</p>
                <p>One has to encounter opposition at first, or even several times.</p>
                <p>So again, I don’t regret my approach, and shall most likely repeat it — not
                    straightaway, exactly — but before too long. I wanted to tell you now that I’d
                    be very pleased if you didn’t just stay neutral in this matter — but on the
                    contrary helped me to get what I want. I’ve admitted I was wrong, not just to
                    Mauve but to T. as well.</p>
                <p>All the more because I believe that later on they themselves will realize that
                    for their part they totally misunderstood things.</p>
                <p>Which they don’t see yet.</p>
                <p>So for my part, by going so far this time as to very generously and decidedly
                    admit I was wrong in the past, moreover to simply show them work as it gets
                    better, <stress reason="environment">in any event I won’t have to make any more
                        apologies in future. Once is enough, and I didn’t necessarily even have to
                        go as far as I did, namely — unconditionally. Getting them to be generous
                        for their part — is another thing – you could assist in this if you want
                        to.</stress> If not — don’t bother about it, but then after a while I’ll
                    return to it again on my own. I don’t know how you’ll have taken my last letter
                    — which wasn’t meant angrily. My affairs can prosper, and in both our interests
                    I wish that we could concentrate the strength we have at our disposal. I’ve
                    replied briefly to both Tersteeg and M. about their refusal, to tell them that
                    ‘I rather agree with Tersteeg that it would be better for me to seek out new
                    people than to try to renew old relationships, that this really is my own idea,
                    too, but above and beyond that, that I nonetheless have enough faith in the
                    future that I will not lightly give up regaining even old relationships, even
                    better than before’. This has been my answer to T. And is also what I tell you —
                    I believe that it’s possible — to get on better terms than the present ones —
                    with you, too.</p>
                <p>But — speaking bluntly — I think that you’ve been too neutral towards me the last
                    1 1/2 or two years, and I wish above all for more warmth, and the friendship was
                    too cool and not animated enough for me.</p>
                <p>Find this pedantic of me if you will — yet it isn’t pedantic but it’s for sound
                    practical reasons that I pointed this out to you before and point it out
                        again.<stress reason="love">Margot Begemann is coming back to Nuenen one of
                        these days — I’ve always remained good friends with her, and it’s on my
                        advice that she did not give in to her sisters, who let it be seen that
                        they’d rather she stayed away and who keep telling her that in their view
                        she has made a hash of things. On the contrary, her family has obligations
                        towards her, and in the past she put her own money into the business when
                        her brother went bankrupt.The issue here is that if she and I choose to love
                        each other, be attached to each other — indeed have been for a long time —
                        this is no wrongdoing on our part nor something for which people may blame
                        us. Either her or me. And in my view it’s absurd that people felt they
                        should get worked up about it — and then — in their opinion — in my interest
                        or in hers. That was a bad turn.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>Anyone may do this with the best intentions — yet — — — Louis Begemann — he had
                    his objections, too, but was such and remained such that both she and I could
                    talk to him, and it was precisely because he was humane and calm that it didn’t
                    turn out much worse, and when that happened with her, which only I knew about,
                    he could help and all the others only hindered. And we were in complete
                    agreement about the steps to be taken then.</p>
                <p>Three days before, after all, I had already warned him and said, I’m concerned
                    about your sister.</p>
                <p>Most certainly, at some time she has done greater or lesser good turns for pretty
                    well all the people here in the neighbourhood, either in sickness or when they
                    were in some trouble or other. And she and I actually became attached during
                    Ma’s illness.</p>
                <p>She has just written to me: should there be any people sick in Nuenen, do go and
                    visit them and see if anything can be done to help. Well, there are a thousand
                    things of that nature in her.</p>
                <p>And to put it very mildly, one can say that there has been a most deplorable
                    misunderstanding here.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="family">I think that, with hindsight, you would now no longer
                        speak as you did on that evening. That concerned me alone — and I could take
                        it, so there’s no question of my reproaching you in this matter.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>Only as an explanation for you, I say, just as you spoke to me, who can take it,
                    so her sisters spoke to her, who was made distraught by it. You have nothing to
                    do with it, because you spoke to me, who can take it, and you did not speak to
                    her.</p>
                <p>But the real fault lies with her sisters, or rather one of the sisters in
                    particular, who proves to be very hard, since she’s actually still sulking and
                    bearing a grudge.</p>
                <p>You — would have to tell me again yourself that you bear a grudge — before I
                    would suspect you of it.</p>
                <p>So much on my part to you.</p>

                <p>
                    <stress reason="family">I suppose you already know that Pa has turned down
                        Helvoirt.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>The people here gave Pa a present of about 200 guilders, that’s most kind and I’m
                    pleased for them.</p>
                <p>The decision wasn’t a matter of indifference to me — since I wouldn’t have gone
                    with them to H. in any case, and would either have stayed here in my studio — or
                    would have left for Antwerp. <unstress reason="friendship">Now — as far as I can
                        see, the best thing for me is simply to carry on as things are — and stay
                        here. It has truly not been going too badly for me lately. It’s true that I
                        can’t make anything financially from my work here — but I’m making really
                        good friends here — and I believe they’ll become even better.</unstress>

                <p>
                    <work stage="finished" origin="new">Last week I painted still lifes day in and
                        day out with the people who are painting in Eindhoven.</work> The new
                    acquaintance — the tanner — whom I told you about, is really doing his best.</p>
                <p>But for my part, I also have to do something to keep on good terms with them.</p>
                <p>But I can’t see that I lose by it, since I work more enjoyably because I have
                    some conversation. Hermans has so many beautiful objects — like old jars and
                    other antiques — that I wanted to ask you whether I could oblige you by painting
                    a still life for your room of some of these objects — Gothic things, for
                    instance.</p>
                <p>The ones I’ve been making with Hermans so far are simpler. But just today he said
                    to me that if I ever want to make a painting for myself of things that are still
                    too difficult for him to do as a study, I can take the objects with me to the
                    studio. Please let me have an answer to this — and if you would like it, I’ll
                    make it for you and shall select really nice things.</p>
                <p>
                    <work origin="new" stage="finished">By the way, I’ve already finished a small
                        one.</work>
                </p>
                <p>Now, as to what I asked you about covering the end of this month if possible by
                    sending me 20 francs extra, I wish you could do that.</p>
                <p>
                    <good_health>It’s getting better for me</good_health> —<stress reason="money">
                        although my expenses aren’t getting any smaller</stress> — but we’re
                    definitely making progress just by working very hard now. So help me with what I
                    asked if it’s at all feasible for you. Because otherwise it will soon become
                    very difficult, and the work will suffer more than necessary.</p>
                <p>And I’ll give it back to you with my work. That’s all I can say about it.</p>
                <p>At all events I’ll ask Hermans for those objects — and make something for you
                    with them — you’ll see for yourself what I told you about the colour, that it’s
                    getting better.</p>

                <p>Cor was unwell for a few days, and at home — but he’s better now. I know that
                    it’s a difficult time for you — but we must progress and it will change a little

            <salutation>Dear brother,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Thanks for your letter and the money.</p>
                <p>Assuming that what you say is true, that <stress reason="family">you started to
                        write to me repeatedly but didn’t get round to finishing the letter before —
                        I’m in the same position, since I’ve already thrown what I wrote to you into
                        the stove twice — because I found it either too bitter or too tame. What
                        shall I say to you?</stress> — your letter sounds very correct to me, and
                    has a tone like that of a good Minister for Fine Arts, say.</p>
                <p>But — that doesn’t alter the fact that it isn’t much good to me and it doesn’t
                    satisfy me — and above all your ‘perhaps later, once you have expressed yourself
                    more clearly, we’ll perhaps also find something in your present work — and then
                    not act as we do now’.... fine promise — but — a ministerial fata Morgana — in
                    the eyes of someone like me, who would rather find an outlet at a lower level
                    provided it was in the present.</p>
                <p>There you have it — that outlet in the present, with 3rdrate dealers if necessary
                    (not from choice) — is something I can’t ask of you in your position — so be it
                    — but you can’t ask me to acquiesce in a ministerial fata Morgana, I’m too
                    practical for that, after all. Please appreciate that I call you a good minister
                    — and know only too well how damned bad the people above the ground floor are as
                    a rule, so I’m very willing to treasure a few bright spots, even in the
                    ministerial sphere. <stress reason="career">Which isn’t intransigent, and it’s
                        for that reason that I herewith certainly piss on the sacred shrine of the
                        intransigents — as I often do — on sacred shrines in general.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="money">To business, though — have you ever realized that I
                        presently have more than two guilders in expenses daily — reckon 1 for the
                        model, 1 for canvas, paint — it can’t come out any cheaper.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="money">I still have bills to pay — and — I must go to Antwerp.
                        My position here is rather too strained, I’m not comfortable at the moment
                        and I have enough trouble sticking it out and ‘possessing my soul in
                        patience’, as they say.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>At home, after all — although there are no real rows — they don’t find the
                    prospect of my staying here too long a pleasant one. Which I can well
                    understand. And yet I can’t leave — either altogether — or partly (partly if I
                    keep my studio on, which is my plan) unless I make a whole lot more studies and
                    — find something new to settle me in Antwerp. Will you please bear this in mind?
                    And if you’d do your best to make it rather easier for me financially, I believe
                    that then there would be a real chance of keeping the peace later, albeit it far
                    from concord. Which I wish for myself and also for others, that calmness.</p>
                <p>What is not can yet come, you say, regarding my work — and I, regarding the
                    perception of something other than a fata Morgana in your saying ‘later we’ll
                    etc. — (see above)’: Today — it’s a fata Morgana to me and I wish, in any event,
                    to try Antwerp. Regards, with a handshake.</p>

            <head>

                1884</date>.</head>
            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Many thanks for your letter and the enclosure, and also for what I received for
                    St Nicholas too. I want to start by telling you that your letter really amazed
                    me — because there has been no difference of any significance between Pa and Ma
                    and myself, <stress reason="family">and that as regards the Begemann ladies,
                        they’ve just very recently been to see Pa and Ma in considerable numbers —
                        not just once but several times. Whether they come as often as or less often
                        than before is something I can’t see that I have anything to do with, nor
                        take the least or slightest interest in.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>The fact that I disapprove of their attitude and will certainly continue to do so
                    is something that I told them once — succinctly — without reverting to it
                    again.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="friendship">But that has nothing further to do with whether or
                        not they come to our house, which concerns not me but Pa and Ma and
                        themselves. I have been courteous to everyone in that family and did not
                        start it but they attacked me and, which bothered me more, Margot — that’s
                        why I’ve absolutely avoided contact with them — precisely because I don’t
                        feel capable of taking back my decided disapproval of their attitude in this
                        matter — or of concealing it.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>What you also know yourself — I say this for clarity, not to cause you sorrow —
                    what you also know yourself, that in order to show you how I said what I said
                    with composure I deliberately dropped you a brief line that I thought your own
                    opinion wrong — (whether it is wrong is for you to decide, but I thought and
                    think it wrong).</p>
                <p>So this is my subjective conviction — I have my own ideas in these things — my
                    whys and wherefores — which I can feel better for myself than make them clear to
                    you or anyone else — particularly when they have neither your attention nor your
                    sympathy. <stress reason="career">Consequently, I let people say and think
                        whatever they will of me more than you might imagine — but you can take this
                        much from me ‘for your guidance’ — that just because I failed in something I
                        don’t admit that I shouldn’t have started it — on the contrary, if I fail
                        many times I find this a reason even if it’s sometimes impossible to
                        continue in exactly the same way — nevertheless to try again in the same
                        direction, since my convictions, too, are considered and intended by me, and
                        I believe that there’s a raison d’être for them.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>For me personally, there’s a cardinal point of distinction between before and
                    after the revolution — the reversal of the social position of the woman, and the
                    collaboration one wants between men and women with equal rights, with equal
                    freedom.</p>
                <p>I have neither the words nor the time to expand on this, nor, in the
                    circumstances, the inclination. But enough, to my mind conventional morality is
                    all backtofront and I hope it will be turned around and replaced in time.</p>
                <p>Now — as to what you say about yourself, probably also for my guidance, ‘that you
                    are mistrustful’ — very well — I don’t want to influence that. You’ve most
                    certainly shown me this — and it’s one of those ‘symptoms’ which I told you I
                    didn’t find very attractive nor congratulated you on.</p>
                <p>But this, too, is a subjective opinion if you will. So go ahead, be mistrustful
                    or not mistrustful as the mood takes you, I will in any event see to it that I
                    accept the consequences for me, and can otherwise only refer you to what I said
                    about standing on different sides of a barricade. <stress reason="family">Do
                        what you want according to your principles — but I’ll act according to mine,
                        and only — if possible, let’s avoid aiming at each other because we’re
                        brothers. I’m older than you, and I’ve probably experienced some things
                        differently and interpreted them differently from you. And this is my own
                        responsibility, of course. That I can’t approve of everything I see you do
                        or hear you say is something very different from wanting to bring you round
                        to my point of view. It’s just — I like to lay my cards on the
                        table.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>And bearing in mind that we must see to it that we avoid putting a spoke in each
                    other’s wheels, I will, as I said, increasingly try to find other contacts or
                    connections in Eindhoven, in Antwerp, in short, wherever I can.</p>
                <p>But this can’t be done all at once — and for my part it’s simply and solely
                    because you’ve shown me all too clearly and unmistakably that I mustn’t imagine
                    that you intend to involve yourself with me personally or with my work other
                    than by way of patronage. Well, you can count me out. <stress reason="family"
                        >And while, without words, without sympathy, I’ve received the money very
                        regularly but very coolly each month, I have — kept working — but —
                        increasingly realizing that a moment could come when we each go our own way
                        instead of the same way together. </stress>
                    <stress reason="money">I don’t suppose in the least that I’ll gain by it
                        financially — but — as soon as some dealer or other, however much of a
                        cheapjack — gives me board and, even if it’s a tiny attic, lodgings and some
                        paint, I’ll sell myself with great pleasure — if you choose to call it
                        selling. Preferable to patronage. </stress>There you see my cards on the
                    table. And whether I’ll succeed in this and when? <stress reason="career">I
                        can’t say precisely, but — I work too hard for me to be so very far away
                        from it. I want, precisely because I foresee that if our paths ever lead us
                        to the same place we might well find ourselves considerably at odds — I want
                        you not to be able to blame me then for being dependent on you. I’m still in
                        two minds as to what I should try to do — but I’ll most probably not stay
                        here after all — and then where to go will be the question.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="family">I don’t think that you’ll approve of my coming to Paris
                        — but what can I do about it? You flatly refuse to look after my interests
                    </stress>— very well — but I can’t just leave it at that. I wouldn’t have
                    thought of it if you had written less decidedly that it was beneath you, but now
                    — well, now — I can take no notice of you.</p>
                <p>In short, I don’t want to exchange the chance (even if it is only a chance) of
                    making it, not even for the certainty of patronage which is, after all, rather
                    tight.</p>
                <p>Since I see that I’m forfeiting my chance of selling by continuing to take the
                    money from you, we must just part. <stress reason="money">Don’t you find it very
                        understandable that, when I hear you say that you can’t do anything with my
                        work for the next few years, I then get the slight sense that, if you want
                        to remain high and mighty on this point, there’s a rather odd contradiction
                        if — precisely because I’m not selling, however hard I work — I’m forced to
                        say, Theo, I’m 25 guilders short, couldn’t you let me have a bit extra, then
                        this proves not to be possible.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>This is very contrary of you: when one sends you something or one asks, please,
                    try to find an opening with the illustrated magazines so that I can earn
                    something extra — one hears no more about it and you don’t lift a finger.</p>
                <p>But one may not say, I can’t manage on my money.</p>
                <p>And up to now — all right — but to carry on — impossible. I also want to tell you
                    that I shan’t be asking you whether you approve or disapprove of anything I do
                    or don’t do — I won’t be embarrassed and, if I feel like going to Paris, for
                    instance, I shan’t ask you whether or not you object. <stress reason="money">The
                        drawback to painting is the paint bill. And at the moment I’m having a far
                        from easy time with it. I already immediately paid out 40 guilders (80
                        francs) of what was sent. Moreover also paid the carpenter for things. So
                        that if, after deduction of what you had to pay, you still had 100 francs
                        left — I have less than 25 francs left, and although I don’t have to live on
                        it at the moment, as you do, I still have to paint on it for a month, which,
                        with models, with paints, is impossible this way.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>And I also have this pleasing prospect for January, when I’ll have to pay some
                    more. <stress reason="money">So what I’m complaining about and why I said that
                        it was actually most decidedly essential that I had something extra now and
                        not later was so that I could for God’s sake at least keep working, and if
                        I’m definitely stuck for financial reasons, it makes me very discontented.
                        And for which I can’t then accordingly blame myself alone, because what I
                        have to pay isn’t caused by extravagance but by working.</stress> If you
                    can’t enter into this or sympathize, and choose to be mistrustful — well, old
                    chap — I believe you really mean well and so — I really don’t take your
                    mistrustfulness too much to heart. Except to the extent that if you’re doing it
                    deliberately to get rid of me, you’re truly well on the way to achieving that
                    goal.</p>
                <p>In the past you know that I often specifically asked you that we should keep up
                    the relationship — now I could no longer urge it in the same way. <stress
                        reason="career">Again, I work too hard for me to have to remain for much
                        longer in a dependent position which degenerates too much into patronage,
                        while when I write about it in a businesslike way I don’t even get an
                        answer. No — old chap — seeing something in it that I may continue to regard
                        as lasting is no longer reconcilable with my sense of honour, of
                        justice.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>Listen — Pa — has been very often and very seriously — mistrustful — of me. You
                    know your side of that anyway, and I for my part perhaps know even more about
                    it. But — nonetheless — he always called himself ‘my friend’ nonetheless — the
                    man thought that he was right and simply couldn’t see any differently — and —
                    so, after all — meant well if you will — namely.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="family">But for my part, one day I spoke out foursquare and
                        said, don’t call yourself my friend if you think this or that of me — people
                        who think of me like that, they’re not friends but enemies, the worst
                        enemies as sure as 2 x 2 = 4. This also applies to you in answer to what you
                        say about mistrust. With this distinction (which I’m willing to appreciate
                        and take into account), Pa did not add ‘that he was mistrustful’, you add
                        that — which makes up for a lot. Yet at bottom I still see the same thing in
                        it.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>Now I don’t want to influence anything, though — and I say bluntly that on my
                    part I don’t in the least undertake to agree with Pa or you. Be aware of that —
                    quite possibly there’s even more than a ditch between the two. And because
                    something of the kind is quite possible, be aware that I absolutely do not urge
                    you to think all sorts of fine and good things about me according to your or
                    Pa’s view of things. It might well be that mine is opposed to them in a
                    revolutionary way. I can’t worry about what people think of me — I must move
                    forward, that’s what I have to think about.And so I go my way with a certain
                    obstinacy, believing in some things and not in others. You — and rightly — set
                    store by your position — don’t you? — by making progress or not making progress
                    — your affairs going poorly or well. Well now, know that I too shall certainly
                    stand up for my profession with no weaker motive than you have for yours. And
                    without going about it all too delicately, must and will persevere. And also
                    very certainly think to keep on my studio here — like Stengelin does, for
                    instance, who has one on the Drenthe heaths — even if he happens to live
                    somewhere else. I’ve rented it as a refuge and it will continue to serve me as
                    such.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="money">So — taking rooms in Eindhoven would be sheer nonsense —
                        and I can’t even think about it. A room in Antwerp later on, all right —
                        that is indeed my intention — but firstly I don’t have any money for it
                        now</stress>, and secondly <work origin="new" stage="planned">I still want
                        to paint a fairly large number of heads first</work> —<stress reason="money"
                        > with which I’ll make progress — to the extent that it’s at all possible
                        for me to pay the models.</stress> Which in the circumstances, as you say,
                    things don’t exactly foster. I can’t do any silly things just like that in the
                    circumstances, and cook my own goose by breaking off here at a moment that
                    doesn’t lend itself to it — just because you’re in a mistrustful period. But be
                    aware of this, that if this mistrustful period endures with you and seems about
                    to take root — even if I don’t do any silly things just like that — I’m
                    nonetheless seriously thinking of seeing to it that we can part in peace and
                    without damage to you or me.However, my very sincere thanks each time for what
                    is sent, and know that if I press for a little extra — it’s precisely in order
                    to continue until we can part, but — in peace — and without harm to you or
                    me.Theo. Although appreciating your proposal to add another 50 francs monthly
                    over and above the 100 francs I asked for, intended as a contribution to Pa
                    towards the cost of my keep, I must most decidedly refuse this (the 50 francs).
                    If I’ve been here at home this long without paying for my board and lodging, you
                    may regard that if you will as arrogance or tactlessness on my part. I did it
                    for the sake of the progress of the painting, and have not profited from it
                    myself in so far as even now I still have a fairly steep paint bill to pay, as
                    surplus expenditure. Apart from that, I acknowledge that it has been
                    advantageous to me after all.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="career">But the reason why I don’t think now is a suitable
                        moment to make a sort of contract with Pa is that under the circumstances it
                        cannot be part of my plans to intend to stay here for very much longer.
                        Which I would like but, I must fear, will prove impossible.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>However, if you do want to agree something with Pa to the effect you indicate in
                    your letter, let it be without involving me at all and in other words a matter
                    between you and Pa which concerns me not at all.</p>
                <p>So that I can then continue to regard the fact that I live here as tactlessness
                    on my part in all events, thus also in the event of payment by you.</p>
                <p>When I’m better I’ll probably go and live in the studio, at least in the
                    daytime.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="money">It’s too much for me all at once, losing you in this
                        respect, and having to pay for my keep again as well. Gradually, though,
                        I’ll see to it that I find another resource of my own accord.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="career">If it can give you any satisfaction that what you call
                        ‘my plans for the future’ are also lying pretty much in ruins,</stress> good
                    luck to you. However, this is still no reason for me to approve of your views in
                    this regard, which, I must repeat, I continue to find bad.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="money">I cannot give up the studio yet — I have to have
                        something fixed, and they can’t in any event demand of me that I leave the
                        village. The fact that it can be foreseen that I have to prepare myself for
                        this, though, is precisely the point that makes me regret that I didn’t
                        already realize last year that our arrangement was unsustainable for both of
                        us. </stress>Regards.VincentI must object to an underlined section in your
                    letter — which I copy.</p>
                <p>‘And I therefore request you, from now on, out of the 150 francs, which I shall
                    keep on sending you, as agreed when we were good friends, it was accepted by us
                    both to give 50 francs to Pa.’</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="money">I object to that, it’s not true that ‘when we were still
                        good friends’ and we agreed that I should pay 50 francs. I remember the
                        conversation about it — in the garden — very well, and far from agreeing to
                        something, I wasn’t willing to agree to anything of that sort then, on that
                        occasion, and it ended with my pointing out to you fairly forcefully that I
                        needed money to get started on several larger canvases I was planning, and
                        had other expenses enough. If anything was agreed, it was for later, when I
                        would be more on top of things.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>This letter tells you explicitly that I flatly refuse to have anything to do with
                    what you might want to agree with Pa about possible payment for board.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="money">Now in order to avoid further misunderstanding in this
                        regard, about this 50 francs for board, I let Pa read your letter of today
                        and this letter. I don’t want to hear any more about this matter; you settle
                        it with Pa. I tell you once more, it’s not true I agreed to pay 50 francs
                        for my board, if I had promised that I would have kept to it, but I remember
                        the whole conversation about it and it’s simply the opposite, namely that I
                        told you that for the time being I had too much else to pay, that I couldn’t
                        do it yet.</stress>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>
                    <work origin="new" stage="middle">I’m very busy working on the series of heads
                        of the people that I’ve resolved to make.</work>
                </p>
                <p>I enclose herewith another scratch of the last one — I usually just scribble them
                    from memory on a scrap of paper in the evening, hence this one.</p>
                <p>
                    <work stage="planned" origin="new">I may perhaps do them in watercolour too,
                        later on. </work>But paint them first.</p>
                <p>Now listen — do you remember that right at the very beginning I always spoke to
                    you of my great respect and sympathy for the work of père Degroux? I think about
                    him more than ever these days. One mustn’t look at his few history pieces —
                    although they’re fine, too — nor in the first place at a few paintings that are
                    in the sentiment of the writer Conscience, for instance. But one must see his
                    Saying grace, The pilgrimage, The paupers’ pew and, above all, above all, the
                    simple Brabant types. Degroux is as little appreciated as Thijs Maris, for
                    instance. He’s different, however — but — they have this in common, that they
                    met with fierce opposition.</p>
                <p>Now — in this age — whether the public is wiser — I don’t know — but I do know
                    this — that it’s absolutely not superfluous to be serious in what one wants and
                    what one does.</p>
                <p>And at this moment I could name you several new names of people who are hammering
                    again on the same old anvil on which Degroux hammered.</p>
                <p>If Degroux — at that time — had chosen to dress his Brabant characters in
                    medieval costumes, he would have run parallel to Leys, not just as regards
                    genius but perhaps also — fortune. However, he didn’t do that and now — years
                    later — people have noticeably changed their minds about the medieval — although
                    Leys will always be Leys and Thijs Maris, Thijs Maris — and Victor Hugo’s
                    NotreDame — NotreDame. But — realism — not wanted then — is now — demanded — and
                    — there’s more need of it than ever. For that realism that has character and a
                    sincere sentiment. <work origin="new" stage="planned">I want to tell you this,
                        that as for me, I’ll try to steer a straight course — and will paint — the
                        dead simple, most everyday things.</work>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="money">How, for God’s sake, is it possible that you don’t seem
                        to be able or willing to understand that, by setting up my studio here and
                        keeping it on for the time being, I’ve made it possible for me to have
                        enough money for painting — and that if I had acted differently, no good
                        would have come of it either for me or for others?</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>Had I not done that, I would have had to muddle along for perhaps another 3 years
                    before I had finally swallowed the bitter pill of colour and tone, also simply
                    because of the expense.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="family">It’s now just a year since I arrived here, driven by
                        necessity. I’m certainly not at home for my pleasure — but for my painting —
                        and, this being so, I think it very wrong of you that you should deprive me
                        of an opportunity if I were to leave here now — before ever I have something
                        new.</stress> I have to be here for a time for my painting — then — as soon
                    as I’ve conquered that more definitely, I’ll be happy to go anywhere I can earn
                    the same as I now have here.</p>
                <p>But I don’t need or deserve to go backwards — nor do I have the slightest desire
                    to — you see? <stress reason="money">And to seek to be rid of you — I’ve never
                        done that, but where you have only too plainly let me see how little chance
                        there was that we’d actually do business together — I accept it for the
                        future, that’s true. Know this once and for all, when I ask you for money, I
                        don’t ask it for nothing</stress> — you can have the work I make with it in
                    return, and if I’m in arrears with it now — I’m on the right road even to get
                    ahead of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="money">I write this yet again for the same reason as the
                        previous letters — I’m stuck at the end of the month because I only have
                        enough left to pay my model for 2 or 3 days. And I’m wretched because I’ll
                        be stuck again for 10 days, or 12, this month.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="money">And in the utmost seriousness, once again — can’t you
                        find some way of helping me with 20 francs, say, to cover that little end?
                        It’s my time that will otherwise not be sufficiently occupied that really
                        pains me.</stress> Regards.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="money">Thanks for the prompt dispatch of the money for this
                        month, arriving promptly like that actually helps me more.</unstress>
                    Thanks, too, for the splendid woodcut after Lhermitte — one of the few things by
                    him that I know, for I saw only these — a troop of girls in the wheat — an old
                    woman in church — and a miner or some such in a little bar, and Harvest by him,
                    and otherwise never anything, and nothing ever as much reflecting his actual
                    manner as these woodcutters.</p>
                <p>If Le Monde Illustré prints a composition by him every month — this is part of a
                    series of ‘Rural months’ — it would give me mighty great pleasure to collect
                    this whole series, and I’d really like you to send them every time.</p>
                <p>Because obviously I never see anything here, and after all I do need to see
                    something really beautiful now and then, and so another time feel free to keep
                    back 20 francs, say, but send me things like this when they appear in the
                    illustrated magazines.Now as to when you write that if I had something ready
                    that I thought was good, you would try to enter it for the Salon — I appreciate
                    your wanting to do this. </p>
                <p>This in the first place — and then further that if I’d known it 6 weeks earlier,
                    I would have tried to send you something for this purpose.</p>
                <p>Now, though, I don’t have anything that I would care to send in. Recently, as you
                    know, <work origin="existing" stage="finished">I’ve painted heads almost
                        exclusively. And they are studies in the true meaning of the word — that is,
                        they’re meant for the studio.</work>
                </p>
                <p>Nonetheless, this very day I’ve started to make some that I’ll send you. </p>
                <p>Because I think it possible that it might be of use, when you meet a good many
                    people on the occasion of the Salon, if you had something you could show —
                    albeit only studies.So you’ll receive heads of an old and a young woman, and
                    probably more than one of these two models. Given what you write of your
                    feelings about various conceptions of heads, I think that these, which come
                    straight out of a cottage with a mossgrown thatched roof, won’t appear to you to
                    be absolutely inappropriate, although they’re studies and nothing else. If I’d
                    known 6 weeks earlier, I would have made a woman spinning or spooling yarn —
                    full length — of them.</p>
                <p>To return for a moment to that question of the female heads in the Jacquet genre,
                    not the earlier ones but of the present day. The reaction against them —
                    certainly with a motive — by people who paint heads of girls like our sisters,
                    for instance — I can well understand that there are painters who do such things
                    — Whistler did it well several times — Millais, Boughton — to mention only
                    people by whom I saw something of the sort in the past. I know little by
                    FantinLatour, but what I saw I thought very good. Chardinesque. And that’s a
                    lot. For my part, though, I’m not the sort of character who has much chance of
                    getting on a sufficiently intimate footing with girls of that sort that they’re
                    willing to pose. Particularly not with my own sisters. And am possibly also
                    prejudiced against women who wear dresses. And my province is more those who
                    wear jackets and skirts.</p>
                <p>Though I think what you say about it is true — namely that it’s perfectly
                    possible to paint them — and it has a raison d’être as a reaction against the
                    presentday Jacquets and Van Beers.</p>
                <p>Just this, though — Chardin (let’s sum up the aim of the reaction in his name,
                    FantinLatour, at least, would approve), Chardin was a Frenchman and painted
                    French women. And in my view, respectable Dutch women like our sisters really do
                    extraordinarily often lack the charm that the French frequently have.</p>
                <p>Consequently, the socalled respectable element among Dutch women isn’t really so
                    very attractive — to paint or to think about. But certain common servant girls,
                    on the other hand, are very Chardinesque.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="career">At present I’m painting not just as long as there’s
                        light, but even in the evening by lamplight in the cottages, if I can
                        somehow make things out on my palette, in order to capture if possible
                        something of the singular effects of lighting at night, for instance with a
                        large shadow cast on the wall.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>I’ve certainly not seen anything in the last few years as fine as those
                    woodcutters by Lhermitte.</p>
                <p>How his little figures in that composition are felt and wanted.</p>
                <p>Thanks again for it.</p>

            <ps>
                <p>The Chardinesque is, it seems to me, a singular expression of simplicity and of
                    goodness — both through and through, and I find it a little hard to believe that
                    one would find it in our sisters, say, either one of them. But if Wil were a
                    Frenchwoman rather than a minister’s daughter, she could have it. But as good as
                    always sails to the opposite point of the compass.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>I felt as you did, in so far as when you write that the work didn’t yet proceed
                    as usual the very first few days, I had the same experience.</p>
                <p>They have therefore been days that none of us will forget, and yet the overall
                    impression isn’t terrible but only grave. Life isn’t long for anyone, and the
                    question is just — to do something with it.</p>
                <p>
                    <work origin="new" stage="middle">The painting went better again today; the
                        first two heads went wrong — today’s is a head of a young girl, almost a
                        child’s head.</work>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <work stage="finished" origin="existing">As to colour, it’s a contrast of bright
                        red and pale green against the colour of the little face; there’s already a
                        head like it among those you took with you.</work> I’d like to hear sometime
                    whether those rolledup ones arrived safely.</p>
                <p>
                    <work origin="new" stage="finished">If I thought that C.M. meant it when he
                        asked for heads of children, I could send him this one I did today</work>,
                    but..... I can’t say I feel much inclined to enter into correspondence (unless
                    he asks for something more specifically).</p>
                <p>It can do no harm, though, that he’s been to the studio.<work stage="planned"
                        origin="new"> I don’t mind starting a new still life of those honesty heads
                        and dry leaves against blue either, because he said something about that
                        too.</work>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="money">Of course I intend to keep working hard, but it’s very
                        necessary for me to square my paint bill as soon as possible. </stress>Every
                    other year, I’ve been able to get square at about this time and buy myself some
                    new equipment. <stress reason="money">And this year I’ve painted so much the
                        last few months that I actually need it more.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>I didn’t want to keep talking about it or contradict you much when you were here
                    — but when you said that I would change some day and, no more than Mauve stayed
                    in Bloemendaal for ever, would I stay here for ever either — maybe — but — I
                    don’t see any advantage myself in moving, because I have a good studio here and
                    the countryside here is very beautiful.Don’t forget that I’m definitely
                    convinced that a painter of peasant life can do no better than follow the
                    example of Barbizon – dwelling and living right in the midst of what one is
                    painting, for it’s new and different outside every day.</p>
                <p>In short, the two reasons for living in the country are that one can do more work
                    and has fewer expenses.</p>
                <p>There are about 3 months, let’s say, between now and the time you come back here
                    in the summer.</p>
                <p>
                    <work origin="new" stage="planned">If I work hard day after day, I can have
                        another 20 or so studies for you by then, and moreover another twenty or so
                        to take to Antwerp if you want.</work>
                    <stress reason="money">But — it’s very necessary for me to pay off my paint bill
                        as soon as possible.</stress> You know I didn’t say another word to you
                    about it either in February or in March.</p>
                <p>But I didn’t have it easy in those months, I can tell you that.</p>
                <p>It has become colder again here. <work stage="planned" origin="new">As soon as we
                        have a few fine days, I’ll make something of the churchyard.</work>
                    <work origin="new" stage="middle">I think the little head I made today is
                        certainly as good as the one you have with a large white cap, which is
                        something like thisAfter ‘this’ (dit) Van Gogh drew a little arrow pointing
                        to the sketches And could serve as a pendant to it.</work>

                    <unstress reason="environment">I’ve just received Germinal, which I started on
                        immediately. I’ve read 50 pages of it — which I think splendid.</unstress> I
                    also walked there once.Here’s a croquis of a head that I just brought back. You
                    received the same one in the last studies I sent, the largest one among them,
                    but painted smoothly.</p>
                <p>
                    <work origin="new" stage="finished">This time I haven’t smoothed out the
                        brushstroke, and besides the colour is very different too. I haven’t yet
                        made a head that’s so much painted with the soil, and more will certainly
                        follow now.</work>

                    studies in the space of a month, say.</p>
                <p>
                    <good_health>I don’t know whether we’ll earn money, but if it’s just enough to
                        work a tremendous amount then I’m content; doing what one wants is what
                        matters.</good_health>
                </p>
                <p>Yes, we must do the miners one day!What did Portier say about the potato eaters?
                    I know myself that there are flaws in it; all the same, precisely because I see

                    or that I send it to you and Portier as soon as possible. Because it’s all the

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>
                    <work origin="existing" stage="finished">Today I sent off that little crate,
                        containing 1 other painting, Peasant cemetery, besides what I already told
                        you.</work>
                </p>
                <p>I’ve left out some details — I wanted to say how this ruin shows that for
                    centuries the peasants have been laid to rest there in the very fields that they
                    grubbed up in life — I wanted to say how perfectly simply death and burial
                    happen, coolly as the falling of an autumn leaf — no more than a bit of earth
                    turned over — a little wooden cross. The fields around — where the grass of the
                    churchyard ends, beyond the little wall, they make a last fine line against the
                    horizon — like the horizon of a sea. And now this ruin says to me how a faith
                    and religion mouldered away, although it was solidly founded — how, though, the
                    life and death of the peasants is and will always be the same, springing up and
                    withering regularly like the grass and the flowers that grow there in that
                    churchyard. Victor Hugo, whom they’ve also just buried, said Religions pass, God
                    remains.I don’t know whether you’ll see anything in these two things — the
                    cottage with the mossy roof reminded me of a wren’s nest. Anyway, you must just
                    look at them.</p>
                <p>Now I must take this opportunity of explaining to you again — which I found new,
                    clear words for — why I wrote and write to you that I’m still far from sure
                    whether your present view is your definite conviction. The firm of G(and)Cie
                    isn’t a good school for getting to know paintings, let alone painters. I tell
                    you this as my opinion — that one doesn’t even learn how to look independently
                    there.</p>
                <p>Who did they greatly honour? Paul Delaroche. I don’t have to tell you how
                    Delaroche was one of the people who really didn’t stand up to scrutiny — there’s
                    simply no one left who takes his part.</p>
                <p>Someone else who won’t stand up to scrutiny — even though he’s better — although
                    he did make something very fine once or twice — who will also fail — that is —
                    Gérôme.His Prisoner, though, his Syrian shepherd are felt, and I think them as
                    fine as anybody, and readily and willingly.</p>
                <p>But by far the most often he’s a Delaroche II. Each of them, taking into account
                    the context of their age, is of equal worth. What I’m now asserting is — that I
                    consider it highly likely that the whole situation will bore you more by the
                    year.</p>
                <p>What I further assert is that one does both others and especially oneself too a
                    disservice by being bored. In spite of many wise lessons, I’ve never seriously
                    granted that being bored ‘for one’s own good’ can have its good, practical side.
                    Now a MASS of people have reformed themselves at the age of about 30 and changed
                    very considerably.</p>
                <p>Just think calmly about this — I tell you that nothing of what I learnt and heard
                    about art at G(and)Cie stood up to scrutiny. How if one reverses the
                    generalities that count there as the conversation killers in judging art —
                    namely praising the old or presentday Delaroche to the skies and discrediting
                    the unorthodox — if, I say, one reverses certain maxims, then — one takes a
                    breath of fresh air. In short — old chap — such curious turns in situations and
                    affairs are possible — not only that — but even the rule. It’s funny, isn’t it —
                    that, after all, I still doubt whether you’ll stay in the trade.</p>
                <p>You don’t have to take any notice of this or reply to it — I say it to you just
                    to express my idea frankly, not to start futile exchanges of words.</p>
                <p>But it’s — an enchanted land — where one isn’t free.</p>
                <p>Anyway — I’ll hear sometime whether you’ve received the little crate and whether
                    you find anything in it.</p>

                        could take them without too many pangs of conscience. It was so real; I also

                <p>I’d like you to give both the paintings a varnish before you show them to Portier
                    or Serret.</p>
                <p>The peasant cemetery has sunk in particularly badly, because it was very
                    different on the canvas at first and I scraped the first thing off completely.
                    It was a total failure at first — then I gave it short shrift and started from
                    the beginning, went and sat on another side and painted early in the morning
                    instead of in the evening. Well, and the other — the one of the cottage — was
                    originally a shepherd. The sheep were shorn last week; I saw it — on a table in
                    a barn.</p>
                <p>I’m glad that this time I can show Portier something very different again. <work
                        origin="new" stage="middle">I’m busy drawing, by the way, so as to send a
                        few fulllength figures in a little while.</work>
                    <work stage="planned" origin="new">But working on the cottages — perhaps you’ll
                        say imitations of Michel, although they aren’t — and searching for subjects,
                        I’ve found such splendid cottages that I now really must go bird’s nesting
                        with a number of variations of these ‘people’s nests’, which remind me so
                        much of the nests of wrens — that’s to say, paint them.</work>
                </p>
                <p>Oh — one mustn’t doubt — anyone who paints the peasants nowadays and has his
                    heart in his work, he wins — at least a part, and not the worst although it’s
                    not the largest — of the public.</p>

                    <good_health>I wish you’d been here on Sunday when we went on that trip. I came
                        back covered in mud because we had to spend a good half hour wading through
                        a stream. But for me painting is now becoming as stimulating and enticing as
                        hunting — it is a hunt, after all, for models, and beautiful places
                        too.</good_health> Regards again, and best wishes to you. It’s already late
                    and I have to be at the place at 5 o’clock, so — adieu. </p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="money">Thanks for your letter and the enclosure, which is
                        exactly what I meant and enables me to work at the end of the month just as
                        at the beginning of the month.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>I was very pleased to hear that Serret is the painter about whom you had
                    previously written things that I had really remembered, but the name had escaped
                    me. I’d like to write much more to you than I will in this letter, but when I
                    get home nowadays I’m really not in the mood for writing when I’ve been sitting
                    in the sun all day. As to what Serret says, I think so too — I’ll drop him a
                    line, because I’d like to become friends with him. <work origin="new"
                        stage="middle">As I already told you, these days I’m hard at work on figure
                        drawings —</work> I’ll send them specifically with an eye to Serret, to show
                    him that I’m far from indifferent to the unity of a figure and the form.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="friendship">Do you ever see Wallis? Might the watercolour of the
                        auction be something for him? If it were something for Wisselingh, then
                        better he should take it. I once gave Wisselingh a couple of heads and also
                        just sent him the lithograph. But because he didn’t send so much as a word
                        in reply, I think that all I’d get would be an insult if I sent something.It
                        just happened to me that, having not heard anything from him in 3 months or
                        so, I suddenly got a letter from Rappard, with whom I’ve been on good terms
                        for years, so supercilious and so full of insults and, it seemed to me, so
                        obviously written after he’d been in The Hague that I’m as good as certain
                        that I’ve lost him as a friend for good.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>It’s precisely because I tried it first in The Hague, that’s to say my own
                    country, that I have every right and reason to forget all that unpleasantness
                    and to think of something else outside my own country.</p>
                <p>You know Wallis well, so perhaps you could bring it up sometime apropos of that
                    watercolour, but act as the opportunity arises. <stress reason="money">If I
                        could earn something with my work, if we had some firm ground, even a little
                        — under our feet, to be able to go on living — and if ever the desire to
                        become an artisan took shape in you — let me say to make it clear — in the
                        manner of, say, discounting all the differences in age (and);c. — Hennebeau
                        in Germinal — what you would be able to paint then!</stress> Still, the
                    future’s always other than one thinks, so one can never know for sure. <stress
                        reason="career">The drawback to painting is that if one doesn’t sell one’s
                        paintings one still has to have money for paints and models to make
                        progress. And that drawback is ugly.</stress>
                    <unstress reason="career"> But otherwise — painting and, to my mind,
                        particularly painting peasant life, gives peace of mind,</unstress> even
                    though one has a lot of scraping along and wretchedness on the outside of life.
                    I mean painting is a home, and one doesn’t have that homesickness, that peculiar
                    thing that Hennebeau had.</p>
                <p>The passage I copied out then struck me very much because, almost literally at
                    that time, I had just such a longing to be something like a grassmower or polder
                        worker.<good_health>And I was sick of the boredom of civilization. It is
                        better, one is happier if one puts it into effect — but pretty much
                        literally — at least one feels really alive. </good_health>And it is
                    something to be deep in the snow in winter, to be deep in the yellow leaves in
                    the autumn, to be deep in the ripe wheat in the summer, to be deep in the grass
                    in the spring. It is something to always be with the mowers and the peasant
                    girls, in summer with the big sky above, in the winter by the black fireplace.
                    And to feel – this has always been so and always will be. One may sleep on
                    straw, eat rye bread — well then, in the long run one is the healthier for
                    it.</p>
                <p>I’d like to write more but — as I said — I’m not really in the mood for writing,
                    and I wanted to enclose a note for Serret, which you must just read, since I
                    write in it about what I wanted to send before long, especially because I want
                    to let Serret see my particular figure studies. Regards,</p>
            </body>

            <ps>
                <p>Serret may agree with you that making good things and selling are quite separate.
                    But there’s no truth in that. When the public saw Millet at last, his work
                    collected together — then the public in both Paris and London was enthusiastic.
                    And who was it who had stood in the way and rejected Millet? — the dealers — the
                    socalled experts (and);c. I ask you, would a Mouret have said something like
                    that, to keep talking about business?</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="money">Thanks for the money,</unstress> your letter and
                    Raffaëlli catalogue. I think the drawings in it are masterly. What he himself
                    also says about ‘character’ is interesting.</p>
                <p>His writing is a mixture of very simple words that come from the heart and from a
                    nervous artistic emotion — they’re moving — and further — of words that I think
                    Raffaëlli himself understands as little as one who has to read them. Thus it is
                    writing full of very fine things and full of mistakes — I would rather read that
                    than anything else. For what he’s talking about is mightily complicated.</p>
                <p>It seems to me, though, that the totality of what he says satisfies — when one
                    has read it — and with all his strange outbursts he nonetheless says something
                    sound and true.</p>
                <p>Theo, you mustn’t think that if I saw Uhde’s painting itself I would lose the
                    impression I got of it. I say again that I believe this man will go the same way
                    as Knaus and Lobrichon — namely that after a few things full of character, the
                    very technique will play a dirty trick on him, that’s to say he’ll start working
                    more and more correctly — and — more and more drily. I find Raffaëlli, say, a
                    painter who stands much higher — than Uhde.</p>
                <p>You don’t hear me having any pessimistic doubts about Lhermitte, do you? So I’m
                    not someone who always doubts. On the contrary, I have a very firm faith in some
                    people. I had never seen anything by Raffaëlli besides those two blacksmiths
                    when I wrote to you about it. Raffaëlli, and above all specifically Lhermitte,
                    though, have what Raffaëlli’s talking about, ‘conscience’. I’m afraid that
                    that’s where Uhde’s weak spot will be. That he’ll no longer know what he
                    wants.</p>
                <p>Anyway. Now you say that Uhde’s silvery grey is so beautiful — and that if I saw
                    the painting I’d think differently about it. No, old chap. I’ve already seen so
                    almighty much grey that I’m not so easily seduced by a bit of silvery grey as I
                    once was. Painting grey as a system is becoming intolerable, and we’ll get the
                    other side of that coin! All the same, to convince you that I want to go on
                    seeing the good in it and am not against it, <work origin="new" stage="middle">I
                        have a grey thing going right now.</work>We’ll — inevitably talk about these
                    things again sometime.</p>
                <p>Don’t forget, though, that although I have certain reservations about Uhde, I
                    said at the outset that I really do think this painting — as far as the main
                    part is concerned, which is 3/4 of the painting — the children — very fine.</p>
                <p>I must get going — didn’t want to wait any longer; am dogtired every day because
                    I’m so far away on the heath.</p>
                <p>I’ve got some more figures.</p>
                <p>I’m sorry about what you write about the money, that you’ll be short
                    yourself.</p>
                <p>Painting is sometimes so damned expensive, and nowadays it just comes down to
                    following one’s own idea at all costs.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="career">We need an art with strength and vigour, says Raffaëlli,
                        and in achieving this in the figure one has so much difficulty finding
                        models.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>The time has passed, and I’m not complaining about it. Although it’s enough for a
                    figure to be put together conventionally, academically – or actually, although
                    many people want precisely that, there’ll be a reaction nonetheless — and I hope
                    that will stir things up. The artists are calling for character, well — the
                    public will do the same. I assure you that I find Uhde’s Christ extraordinarily
                    unfortunate, it won’t do — the children are good.</p>
                <p>I’m so fond of Lhermitte — Raffaëlli — because it’s thought out through and
                    through, sensible and honest.</p>
                <p>
                    <work stage="finished" origin="new">I’ve got a few figures here, a woman with a
                        spade seen from behind</work>,<work stage="finished" origin="new"> another

                </p>
                <p>I’ve been spying on these peasant figures here for 1 1/2 years and on their
                    activities, precisely to get some character into it. So I really can’t stand a
                    Santa Claus like Uhde put there in that little school — the little school itself
                    is so fine, though! Uhde himself — well, I wager that he knows it too — and that
                    he did it on account of the fact that the good citizens of that country where he
                    lives desire a ‘subject’ and ‘something conventional to think about’, and
                    otherwise he’d have to starve. <stress reason="career">If I find another moment
                        one of these days when I’m not too tired to write,</stress> I’ll try to tell
                    you how outstandingly good I find some things in Raffaëlli. Regards, with a

                <p>I wish that the 4 canvases I wrote to you about were gone. I may work on them
                    again if I keep them here too long, and I think it’s better for you to get them
                    as they come from the heath.</p>

                        you might be short yourself, and I can’t pay the carriage myself
                        either.</stress>

                    <work stage="finished" origin="existing">One of them is the residence of a
                        gentleman who’s popularly known here as ‘the peasant of Rauwveld’
                        </work>—<work stage="finished" origin="existing"> the other is occupied by a
                        worthy soul who, when I went there, was engaged in nothing more mysterious
                        than turning over her potato patch, but must also be able to work magic,
                        though — at any rate she goes by the name of ‘the witch’s head’. </work>You
                    remember that it says in the book by Gigoux how it came about that Delacroix had
                    17 paintings rejected at the same time. This shows — at least so it seems to me
                    — that he and others from that period — were faced with connoisseurs and
                    nonconnoisseurs, none of whom either understood it or wanted to buy — this shows
                    that those who are rightly described in the book as ‘the valiant ones’ didn’t
                    talk about fighting a losing battle, but carried on painting.</p>
                <p>Something else I wanted to say to you is that we’ll have to paint a lot more if
                    we take that about Delacroix as our startingpoint. <stress reason="money">I must
                        necessarily be the most disagreeable of all people, that’s to say having to
                        ask for money.</stress>
                    <stress reason="money">And since I don’t think that things will take a turn for
                        the better as regards sales in the next few days, this is bad
                        enough.</stress> But I ask you, isn’t it better, after all, for both of us
                    to work hard even though there are difficulties attached to it, than to sit
                    about philosophizing at a time like this?</p>
                <p>I don’t know the future, Theo — but — I do know the eternal law that everything
                    changes — think back 10 years and things were different, the conditions, the
                    mood of the people, everything in short. And 10 years on, a great deal is bound
                    to have changed again. But doing something endures — and one doesn’t easily
                    regret having done something. The more active the better, and I’d rather fail
                    than sit idle. Whether Portier is or isn’t the man to do something with my work
                    — we need him now all the same. And here’s what I think – after working for a
                    year, say, we’ll have got more together than now, and I know for sure that my
                    work will do better as I complete one thing with another. The people who have
                    some feeling for it now, who, like him, talk about showing it sometime — they’re
                    consequently useful, because after another year’s work, say, they’ll have a few
                    more things together that will speak for themselves, even if they say nothing at
                    all. Should you happen to see Portier, feel free to tell him that, far from
                    giving up, I’m planning to send him much more. You must also go on showing when
                    you meet people. It won’t be so very long before what we can show will be more
                    important. Y<good_health>ou can see for yourself — and it’s a phenomenon that
                        gives me surprisingly great pleasure — that people are increasingly starting
                        to stage exhibitions of 1 person or a very few who belong
                        together.</good_health> This is a phenomenon in the art trade which I dare
                    think has more future than other enterprises. It’s good that people are
                    beginning to understand that a Bouguereau can’t do well beside a Jacque — nor a
                    figure by Beyle or Lhermitte beside a Schelfhout or Koekkoek. </p>
                <p>Scatter Raffaëlli’s drawings about — and judge for yourself whether it would be
                    possible to form a good idea of this singular artist. He — Raffaëlli — isn’t
                    like Régamey — but I find him just as much of a personality. If my work stayed
                    with me — I think I’d be constantly working over it. By sending it to you and to
                    Portier as it comes from the countryside or from the cottages, the odd thing
                    that isn’t right will sometimes get through — but things that wouldn’t be
                    improved by frequently working over them will be preserved.</p>
                <p>
                    <work origin="existing" stage="finished">If you had these 4 canvases and a few
                        more, smaller studies of cottages,</work> and someone saw nothing by me
                    other than those, they’d be bound to think that I did nothing other than paint
                    cottages. <work stage="finished" origin="existing">And likewise with that series
                        of heads.</work> But peasant life involves such diverse things that when
                    Millet speaks of ‘working like a bunch of negroes’, this really does have to
                    happen if one wants to achieve a whole. One may laugh at Courbet’s saying,
                    ‘painting angels! who has ever seen angels!’ But I’d just like to add, for
                    instance, ‘justices in the harem, who has ever seen justices in the Harem?’ (the
                    painting by BenjaminConstant). ‘Bull fights, who has ever seen those?’ and so
                    many other Moorish, Spanish things, Cardinals, and then all those history
                    paintings, which are still always there, metres high by metres wide! What’s the
                    point of it all, and what do people want with it? After a few years most of it
                    becomes stale and dull, and more and more boring.But still. Perhaps they’re well
                    painted — maybe. Nowadays, when connoisseurs stand in front of a painting like
                    the one by BenjaminConstant, or like a reception at a cardinal’s by some
                    Spaniard or other — it’s the custom to say, with a knowing air, something about
                    ‘clever technique’. But — as soon as those same connoisseurs found themselves in
                    front of a scene from peasant life or a drawing by Raffaëlli, say, they would
                    criticize the technique with the same air — à la C.M.</p>
                <p>Perhaps you think that I’m wrong to comment on this — but — I’m so gripped by the
                    thought that all these exotic paintings are painted in THE STUDIO. But just go
                    and sit outdoors, painting on the spot itself! Then all sorts of things like the
                    following happen — I must have picked a good hundred flies and more off the 4
                    canvases that you’ll be getting, not to mention dust and sand (and);c. — not to
                    mention that, when one carries them across the heath and through hedgerows for a
                    few hours, the odd branch or two scrapes across them . Not to mention that when
                    one arrives on the heath after a couple of hours’ walk in this weather, one is
                    tired and hot. Not to mention that the figures don’t stand still like
                    professional models, and the effects that one wants to capture change as the day
                    wears on.I don’t know how it is with you — but for my part, the more I work on
                    it the more peasant life absorbs me.<unstress reason="career"> And the less and
                        less I care about either the Cabanelesque things, among which I would also
                        count Jacquet, also BenjaminConstant’s present work — or the highly praised
                        but so unspeakably, hopelessly dry technique of the Italians and
                        Spaniards.</unstress> Image makers! — what Jacque said, I often think about
                    it. But I’m not biased; I like Raffaëlli who, after all, paints something very
                    different from peasants — I like Alfred Stevens, Tissot, to mention something
                    that’s entirely unlike peasants — I like a fine portrait. Zola who otherwise, to
                    my mind, often makes colossal mistakes in his judgement of paintings — says
                    something beautiful about art in general in ‘Mes haines’. ‘In the painting (the
                    work of art) I look for, I love the man — the artist.’</p>
                <p>There you are, I think that’s perfectly true — I ask you, what sort of a man,
                    what sort of a visionary/observer or thinker, what sort of a human character is
                    there behind some of these canvases praised for their technique — often, after
                    all, nothing. But a Raffaëlli — is someone, a Lhermitte is someone, and in many
                    paintings by virtually unknown people one feels that they were made with a will,
                    with emotion, with passion, with love. The TECHNIQUE of a painting from peasant
                    life or — like Raffaëlli — from the heart of urban workers — entails
                    difficulties quite different from those of the slick painting and the rendering
                    of action of a Jacquet or BenjaminConstant. That’s to say, living in those
                    cottages day in and day out, being out in the fields just like the peasants —
                    enduring the heat of the sun in the summer, the snow and frost in the winter,
                    not indoors but outside, and not for a walk, but day in and day out like the
                    peasants themselves.</p>
                <p>And I ask you, when you think about it, am I so wrong to criticize the criticism
                    of the connoisseurs, who are presently fencing more busily than ever with the
                    often so meaningless word technique (they’re increasingly giving it a
                    conventional meaning)?</p>
                <p>When one counts all the trudging and lugging one has to do to paint ‘the peasant
                    of Rauwveld’ and his cottage, I dare swear that this is a longer and more tiring
                    expedition than many painters of exotic subjects, be it the justice in the harem
                    or the reception at the cardinal’s, make for their choicest eccentric subjects.
                    For in Paris one can get Arab or Spanish or Moorish models simply by ordering
                    and paying for them. But it’s harder for someone like Raffaëlli, who paints the
                    ragpickers of Paris in their own small quarter, and his work is more
                    serious.</p>
                <p>Seemingly there’s nothing simpler than painting peasants or ragpickers and other
                    labourers but — no subjects in painting are as difficult as those everyday
                    figures!There isn’t — as far as I know — a single academy where one learns to
                    draw and paint a digger, a sower, a woman hanging a pot over the fire, or a
                    seamstress. But in every town of any consequence at all there’s an academy with
                    a choice of models for historical, Arab, Louis XV and, in a word, all figures,
                    provided they don’t exist in reality.</p>
                <p>
                    <work origin="new" stage="planned">If I send you and Serret a few studies of
                        diggers or peasant women who are weeding, gleaning corn (and);c. as the
                        start of a whole series about all kinds of work in the fields — then it may
                        be that either Serret or you will discover faults in them which will be
                        useful for me to know about, and which I’ll naturally concede myself.</work>
                    But I want to point out something that’s perhaps worth noting. All academic
                    figures are constructed in the same way and, let’s admit, one couldn’t do
                    better. Impeccable — without faults — you’ll already have seen what I’m driving
                    at — also without giving us anything new to discover. Not so the figures of a
                    Millet, a Lhermitte, a Régamey, a Lhermitte, a Daumier. They’re also well
                    constructed — but not the way the academy teaches, after all. I think that no
                    matter how academically correct a figure may be, it’s REDUNDANT in this day and
                    age, even if it were by Ingres himself (apart from his Source of course, because
                    that indeed was and is and will remain something new) if it lacks that essential
                    modernism — the intimate character, the actual DOING SOMETHING.</p>
                <p>When will the figure not be redundant then, even though there were necessarily
                    faults and grave faults in it to my mind, you’ll probably ask.</p>
                <p>When the digger digs, when the peasant is a peasant, and the peasant woman a
                    peasant woman. Is this something new? Yes. Even the little figures by Ostade,
                    Ter Borch don’t work the way they do nowadays.I’d like to say a lot more about
                    this and I’d like to say how much I myself want to do what I’ve begun even
                    better — and how much higher than my own I value the work of some others. I ask
                    you — do you know of a single digger, a single sower in the old Dutch school???
                    Did they ever try to make ‘a labourer’? Did Velázquez try it in his
                    watercarrier? Or his folk types? No. Work, that’s what the figures in the old
                    paintings don’t do. <work stage="middle" origin="new">These days I’m slogging
                        away at a woman whom I saw last winter, lifting carrots in the snow.</work>
                    There it is — Millet did it, Lhermitte, and in general the peasant painters of
                    this century — an Israëls — they find that more beautiful than anything else.
                    But even in this century, how relatively few there are among the legion of
                    painters who want the figure — yes — above all — for the sake of the figure
                    (i.e. for the sake of form and modelling) but can’t conceive of it other than
                    working, and also have the need — which the old masters avoided, as did the old
                    Dutch masters who depicted so many conventional actions — and — I say — have the
                    need to paint the action for the action’s sake.</p>
                <p>So that the painting or the drawing is a figure drawing for the sake of the
                    figure and the inexpressibly harmonic form of the human body — yet at the same
                    time — is lifting carrots in the snow. Am I expressing myself clearly? I hope
                    so, and just say this to Serret — I can say it in fewer words — a nude figure by
                    Cabanel, a lady by Jacquet and a peasant woman not by BastienLepage himself, but
                    a peasant woman by a Parisian who learnt to draw at the academy, will always
                    show the limbs and the structure of the body in the same way — sometimes
                    charmingly — correct — in proportion and anatomy. But when Israëls or when
                    Daumier or Lhermitte, say, draw a figure, one will feel the form of the body
                    much more and yet — this is why I particularly want to include Daumier — the
                    proportions will sometimes be almost random, the anatomy and structure often
                    completely wrong ‘in the eyes of the academicians’.</p>
                <p>But it will live. And above all Delacroix, too.</p>
                <p>It still isn’t expressed properly. Tell Serret that I would be desperate if my
                    figures were good, tell him that I don’t want them academically correct. Tell
                    him that I mean that if one photographs a digger, then he would certainly not be
                    digging. Tell him that I think Michelangelo’s figures magnificent, even though
                    the legs are definitely too long — the hips and buttocks too broad. Tell him
                    that in my view Millet and Lhermitte are consequently the true painters, because
                    they don’t paint things as they are, examined drily and analytically, but as
                    they, Millet, Lhermitte, Michelangelo, feel them. Tell him that my great desire
                    is to learn to make such inaccuracies, such variations, reworkings, alterations
                    of the reality, that it might become, very well — lies if you will — but — truer
                    than the literal truth.</p>
                <p>And now I must close soon — I did need, though, just to talk about the fact that
                    those who paint the life of the peasants or the common people, although they
                    aren’t counted among the men of the world — will still, however, perhaps endure
                    better in the long run than the makers of the exotic but painted in Paris harems
                    and cardinals’ receptions.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="money">I know that it’s being a disagreeable person when one’s
                        in need of money at inconvenient times — but my excuse is just that painting
                        the seemingly most everyday things is sometimes the most difficult and most
                        expensive.The expenses that I must incur if I want to work are sometimes
                        very heavy in relation to my means. I assure you that if my constitution
                        weren’t becoming virtually like that of a peasant as a result of wind and
                        weather, I wouldn’t stick it out, for there’s simply nothing left over for
                        my own comfort. But I don’t desire that for myself either, any more than
                        many peasants desire to live other than as they live. But what I do ask is
                        both for paint and, above all, for models. You’ll perhaps realize from what
                        I say about the figure drawings that I’m positively passionate about going
                        on with them.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>You recently wrote to me that Serret had spoken to you ‘with conviction’ about
                    certain faults in the structure of the figures of the potato eaters. But you’ll
                    have been able to see from my answer that my own criticism also condemns them,
                    considered from that point of view, only I’ve pointed out how this was an
                    impression I had after I’d seen the cottage in the dim lamplight on many
                    evenings, after having painted 40 heads, from which it follows that I was
                    starting from a different point of view. Now we’ve started talking about the
                    figure, though, I have a great deal to say. I find in Raffaëlli’s words, his
                    perception about ‘Character’, what he says about that is good — and in its place
                    — and clarified by the drawings themselves.</p>
                <p>People who move in artistic and literary circles, though, as Raffaëlli does in
                    Paris, think differently after all from, say, the way I do out in the country
                    among the peasants. I mean they search for one word that sums up all their ideas
                    — he suggests the word ‘Character’ for the figures of the future. I agree with
                    it, with the intention — I believe — but I believe as little in the accuracy of
                    the word as in the accuracy of other words — as little as in the accuracy or
                    appositeness of my own expressions.Rather than saying there has to be character
                    in a digger — I describe it by saying this peasant has to be a peasant, this
                    digger has to dig, and then there’s something in it that is essentially modern.
                    But I feel that people can draw conclusions I don’t mean even from these words —
                    even were I to add a whole list.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="money">Instead of reducing the expenses for models — which are
                        already quite a burden on me — I think it would be desirable — very
                        desirable — if I could increase them a little.</stress> Because I’m
                    concerned with something very different from being able to do ‘a little figure’
                    drawing. Showing the figure of the peasant in action, you see that’s what a
                    figure is — I repeat — essentially modern — the heart of modern art itself —
                    that which neither the Greeks, nor the Renaissance, nor the old Dutch school
                    have done.</p>
                <p>To me, this is a matter I think about every day. However, this difference between
                    both the great and the lesser masters of the present (the great, for instance
                    Millet, Lhermitte, Breton, Herkomer; the lesser, for instance Raffaëlli and
                    Régamey) and the old schools isn’t something I’ve often found expressed truly
                    forthrightly in articles on art.</p>
                <p>Just think about whether you don’t find it’s true, though. The figure of the
                    peasant and the workman started more as a ‘genre’ — but nowadays, with Millet in
                    the van as the eternal master, it’s the very heart of modern art and will remain
                    so.</p>
                <p>People like Daumier — one has to respect them because they’re among the pioneers.
                    The simple nude but modern figure ranks high — as revived by Henner and
                    Lefebvre, Baudry and, above all, the sculptors like a Mercier, Dalou, they’re
                    also among the very soundest. But peasants and labourers simply aren’t nude, and
                    so one doesn’t have to think nude. The more people who start making figures of
                    workmen and peasants the better I’ll like it. <good_health>And I myself, I know
                        of nothing else in which I take so much delight.</good_health> This is a
                    long letter and I still don’t know whether I’ve said what I mean clearly enough.
                    I may perhaps drop Serret a line. If I do, I’ll send the letter to you to read,
                    because I want to make it clear how much I attach to this question of the
                    figure.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="family">What very much distresses me in our conversation is that
                        when I say that I fear it will be tight for you this year, you reply: ‘that
                        you observe that I’d like to see that’, ‘that you see very well that you
                        can’t rely on me’, ‘that you know very well that I would be returning you no
                        thanks for your pains’. This is not so, and it distresses me that this is
                        how you see it.</stress>
                    <stress reason="money"/>
                </p>
                <p>My suggestion has been this — don’t regard my little painting business as dead
                    weight and don’t treat it harshly, for the reason that it could prove to be a
                    little boat in a disaster when the big ship is lost. My suggestion is and
                    remains — let’s at any rate keep that little boat in good condition and ready to
                    sail, whether the storm comes or my anxiety proves to be unfounded. At the
                    moment I’m a little vessel which you have in tow and once in a while can only
                    seem to you to be dead weight. Which, by the way — as dead weight — you can
                    leave behind by cutting the rope if you want to. But in this case I, who am the
                    skipper of my small craft, ask that far from having the towrope cut, my little
                    craft should be caulked and provisioned so that it may do better service in time
                    of need.</p>
                <p>Should you doubt the good faith of this request, then for my part I can do
                    nothing but repeat it more emphatically. <stress reason="money">For I notice
                        that on the side of the paint bill, my own little craft is springing leaks
                        here and there.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <good_health>I’m plugging these leaks as much as I can, though, and am not yet
                        losing my coolheadedness. Am not desperate either.</good_health> But since
                    we’ll perhaps both be in the same storm, I speak emphatically and, I believe, in
                    both our interests.</p>
                <p>I can sum up your answer to my question thus: ‘there may be a storm coming but,
                    even in that case, don’t count on either caulking or provisions, and be aware
                    that I may be compelled by the force of circumstances to cut the towrope’.I can
                    take this answer as a warning, but only in so far as it’s not accompanied by
                    suspicion of my good faith.</p>
                <p>But — by means of this letter I cry out to you again that my request for
                    reinforcement may prove to be in both our interests, and I’m not doing it just
                    out of selfishness, as you assume. <stress reason="money">That in the event of a
                        storm, I in all events am willing but perhaps also able to be of some use
                        and service to you, but that this will be impossible in the event that my
                        own craft fills with water (which I’m trying to prevent, though) before the
                        moment in question. I’m trying to prevent that myself, though, but still I
                        wouldn’t cry out to you without necessity. I’m not afraid in the face of
                        danger either, but nonetheless I try to be prepared in case disaster
                        strikes.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>If it seems to you unfounded that I urge that we should gradually let my, but I
                    would rather say our little painting business become the heart of a business
                    that we could go on to undertake together, <unstress reason="career">for my part
                        I insist that it can and will become something if we can remain sufficiently
                        united.</unstress>If I don’t have the same ideas as you, don’t suspect me of
                    bad faith or base intentions anyway, either towards you or towards those at
                    home. I do nothing to those at home that I have no right to do, since I
                    absolutely and always keep out of their affairs. Don’t ask for or urge advice,
                    keep entirely to my own territory — and even keep my feelings about their
                    affairs to myself too, since we don’t understand one another’s interests
                    anyway.</p>
                <p>And to you I speak now, and will go on speaking, as someone whose business is in
                    paintings to someone else whose business is in paintings, and I will not intrude
                    on the other territory.</p>
                <p>And the question that I started to discuss with you is this: even if the slump is
                    severe, and even if we both have to take great trouble, we must see to it that
                    we keep an energetic hand on the little painting business that belongs to you as
                    well as to me. I say, it might be a boat that could possibly be of service to
                    you in the storm, although I wish for the storm as little as you can wish for
                    it.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>I’ve heard from that colourman — who tells me I can send the paintings. But that
                    he wants me to send them as soon as possible because there are many strangers in
                    The Hague at present.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="money">He’s quite right there. What I want to ask you is that
                        you try to send me enough for me to get the crate made and pay the carriage.
                        Deduct it next month, if you like — but I have nothing, and it’s important
                        to me to get my consignment off immediately.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <bad_health>Your visit really left me with a less than favourable
                        impression</bad_health> — I believe more than ever that more difficulties
                    await you in the next few years than you imagine.</p>
                <p>I continue to insist that it’s somewhat fatal that your energy has evidently
                    taken a different direction, rather than working on our getting our heads above
                    water with the painting. And yet it’s such a short while ago that you wrote that
                    you now had more confidence that my work was good. You take it as though I was
                    doing you wrong or was hostile to you, now I most decidedly have rather a lot of
                    remarks to make. And considerable concerns for the future. I can’t speak other
                    than I did, can I?</p>
                <p>To my mind you don’t in the least belong among the rising men now. Take this
                    amiss of me — if you will — and treat me as you will accordingly. </p>
                <p>I’m willing to take back my remarks should I see very different things in you,
                    but that I made them during your visit — Yes. But even though you say today,
                    ‘I’m selling 500,000 francs’ worth a year’ — this doesn’t make any impression on
                    me at all, since I’m only too convinced of the precariousness of it all — you
                    keeping up even a half or a fifth of that and delivering in the years ahead.
                    It’s too up in the air for me, too little at ground level.</p>
                <p>And art itself is solid enough, that’s not the trouble.</p>
                <p>But, ‘to be a countinghouse will pass’ was said, not by me, but by someone whose
                    words came dreadfully true. And I wish you were, or would become, a painter. I
                    put it bluntly, more strongly than before, because I believe so firmly that the
                    largescale art trade is, in many respects, too much like tulip mania.</p>
                <p>And the positions in it dependent on chance and whim. Make a miscalculation —
                    make what may be an insignificant mistake — and — what’s left of that huge
                    figure you’re turning over now? That figure depends on whim.</p>
                <p>And KNOWLEDGE of art, stripped bare, is related, more closely than you think, to
                    the practice of art. TRADE in paintings is something very different when one is
                    on one’s own from when one works for large distributors. And it’s the same with
                    other things, too. Anyway — work hard — but — try to work sensibly too.</p>
                <p>The trouble you’ve taken together with me — for providing money is also taking
                    trouble and there’s absolutely no getting away from it — this trouble has at
                    least been an act of personal initiative, and of personal will and energy — but
                    what am I to think or say of it if, little by little, with the decided weakening
                    of the financial aid, something else weren’t to be put in its place? And now,
                    above all, to my mind at any rate, it’s the time to try to push ahead with my
                    work.</p>
                <p>I’ve also been looking for addresses in Antwerp, and will hear more precisely
                    about them before long. Then I can probably send things there, too. But if you
                    want these things, help me to bring them about. You said to me yourself, Where
                    there is a will there is a way; well then, <stress reason="money">I’ll take you
                        at your word a little as to whether you’re really seeking for us to make
                        progress. If I were to ask for extravagant things and you refused, then so
                        be it — but where they’re the most essential, the very simplest necessities,
                        and the lack just becomes more and more, and worse and worse, then I think
                        you’re taking economy too far, and in this respect it’s very far from being
                        useful.</stress>

            <ps>
                <p>Just a word about Serret and about Portier.<stress reason="money"> Tell them as
                        it is, that is that I did have studies ready, but that I had to pay a
                        colourman who was making it difficult for me just now.</stress> That in
                    order to put a stop to it, I wrote to tell him that I put his paint in my
                    studies, and that I asked him to take the trouble to sell something for me
                    instead of nagging. That I’ll go through with it, and have to send him
                    things.</p>
                <p>That as to the drawings which I said I’d show Serret, since I’m in a hurry to do
                    things, I need them myself. But I do still think it’s of some importance that at
                    any rate he knows that I really did have them when you came, and that you tell
                    him that you saw them at my place, and then also tell him exactly what you
                    think. I won’t influence your own opinion. That I’m sad about your thinking that
                    this is all right, though, yes — that is so.</p>
                <p>But I don’t refuse to take such measures — and even if one of these colourmen
                    wanted to sell off my bits and pieces, he would be welcome to go to those
                    lengths. It’s certain that the paintdealing gentlemen wouldn’t blush to do
                    it.</p>
                <p>However, I’m fed up with talking about it; I’ve said what I had to say — and you
                    — you can deal with my suggestion as you see fit. </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="money">And if these fellows want to attack me and sell me up,
                        since they expressly threatened me with collection, and that over matters of
                        less than 30 guilders, then I won’t be able to resist them and will let them
                        do as they please, but it will be as if it happens before your very eyes,
                        since you’ve just been here.</stress> That I can’t stop the work at the
                    level I now am, that’s true. <stress reason="career">I need paint every day. I
                        must make progress,</stress> and <stress reason="money">if I want to pay for

                        = 250 francs</stress>
                </p>
                <p>Suppose I get 4 x 150 francs from you for Sept. Oct. Nov. Dec.= 600 francs. That
                    then leaves 350 francs to last from now until New Year. And then bear in mind
                    that I have literally nothing left this month, and that I also have to live this
                    month.</p>
                <p>So that from Aug. – 1 January, in other words almost 5 months, I have to live and
                    paint on 350 francs. Which I can do on 150 francs a month, but not easily, but
                    anyway it’s possible as a minimum.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="career">However, if in the course of 4 months 250 francs has to
                        be deducted to pay for paint and rent, well then, the work is hampered and
                        obstructed so much that one doesn’t know what to do, and would rather say to
                        the fellows sell my things then!</stress>
                    <stress reason="career">But let me work! Without hesitation I’ve just thrown
                        this month in to calm the fellows down. But the hardship that’s caused is
                        bad enough.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>And my last word on the subject is that if my work were weak and awful, I would
                    agree with you if you said — ‘I can’t do anything about it’.</p>
                <p>Well — since larger and smaller painted studies as well as new drawings were able
                    to make you understand that we’re making progress with it, I’m not so sure
                    whether ‘I can’t do anything about it’ should be your final word. Talk to
                    Serret, talk to Portier about it — and say how much I want to keep working and
                    how little opportunity I have myself to find art lovers, since painting the
                    peasants means that once and for all the countryside, not the city is my place
                    of work.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>I wanted to add to my letter of the day before yesterday that I had a letter from
                    Rappard yesterday, and our quarrel is wholly made up, that he sent me a croquis
                    of a large painting of a brickworks that he’s working on. This looks very
                    original — if one wanted to find other paintings in the same spirit, it would be
                    Meunier, say, whose mineworkers you saw in Antwerp. He’s rented a small house
                    outside Utrecht, just as a studio (and arranged for light from above) near the
                    brickworks, and since he’s also going back to Terschelling he’s deep in nature
                    again, and to my mind that’s better than working in town.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="family">I wanted to tell you, though, that I hope that the
                        quarrel that we have will end like this, too, and that it will be
                        settled.</stress> No more than I can accept his criticism, can I fully
                    resign myself to the present situation in which my work is held up so badly by
                    my financial difficulties. I don’t ask you to put this right alone, but I simply
                    want us to do our best together (and not just I alone either) to make headway.
                    It’s an effort for you, too, and not easy; I know that, and as such I appreciate
                    it very much, but making an effort for a goal is no misfortune, and having to
                    fight is the precondition for every honest victory.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="money">The expenses of painting can’t always be avoided, and not
                        incurring them is sometimes not the best policy, because nothing decent
                        could come of it if one hesitated to pay for models or essential painting
                        materials. And since it’s getting harder for me rather than better, it has
                        eventually got to such a pitch that I definitely have to complain.And I say
                        once more, let’s keep my little painting business in order, because sooner
                        or later we might be in sore need of it.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>When there’s a storm in the air, one has to keep the boats in good shape. The man
                    I now have in The Hague is Leurs, who doesn’t live in Praktizijnshoek any more
                    but in Molenstraat.</p>
                <p>He’s asking me to send him more than one painting in order to have more than one
                    chance, and is offering me his two windows.</p>
                <p>And since he’s very hard pressed for money himself, he won’t shrink from making
                    an effort. <work stage="finished" origin="new">I’m sending him a couple of
                        cottages, the old tower and smaller ones of figures.</work>
                    <work origin="new" stage="planned">And while he shows those, I’ll make a few new
                        ones to keep him going.</work>
                </p>
                <p>I’ve also got a chance of persuading a second in The Hague.</p>
                <p>But for me it comes down to being able to go on working.</p>
                <p>
                    <work origin="new" stage="finished">I’ve made another small painting of the
                        wheat harvest since you left, the same size as the women pulling turnips in
                        the snow: a reaper, a woman binding sheaves, sheaves, and the windmill, like
                        the drawings you saw. An effect in the evening after sunset.</work>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <work stage="finished" origin="new">Also more studies of interiors.</work>
                </p>
                <p>Once again I suggest that you just talk it over with Portier and Serret, say that
                    I’m in quite a fix, encourage them to do what they can, that for my part I’ll
                    see about sending them new things.</p>
                <p>And let’s see about getting that crate off. <work origin="new" stage="finished"
                        >I’ve also painted 3 more studies of the women among the potatoes, the first
                        of which you’ve already seen.</work>
                </p>
                <p>Rappard had spoken to Wenckebach, and in his letter there was no longer any trace
                    of the tone he’d started to take. And although he’s going to Terschelling first,
                    he writes that he wants to come and make more studies here. Regards, and wishing
                    you good fortune.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Thanks for your letter and 150 francs enclosed. I also received the two new
                    Lhermittes today. He’s a master of the figure. He’s able to do what he likes
                    with it — conceiving the whole neither from the colour nor from the local tone,
                    but rather proceeding from the light — as Rembrandt did — there’s something
                    astonishingly masterly in everything he does — in modelling, above all things,
                    he utterly satisfies the demands of honesty.</p>
                <p>A great deal is said about — Poussin. Bracquemond talks about him, too. The
                    French call Poussin their greatest ever painter among the old masters. Well it’s
                    certain that what’s said about Poussin, whom I know so very little about, I find
                    in Lhermitte and in Millet. But with this distinction, that it seems to me
                    Poussin is the original grain, the others are the full ear. For my part, then, I
                    rate today’s superior.<stress reason="environment">This last fortnight I’ve had
                        a great deal of trouble with the reverend gentlemen of the priesthood, who
                        gave me to understand — of course with the best of intentions and, no less
                        than others, believing that it was their duty to interfere — who gave me to
                        understand that I shouldn’t be too familiar with people beneath my station —
                        who, having spoken to me in those terms, spoke in a very different tone to
                        the ‘people of lower station’, that’s to say with threats that they mustn’t
                        allow themselves to be painted.</stress> This time I simply went straight to
                    the burgomaster and told him exactly what had happened, and pointed out that
                    this was none of the priests’ business and that they should stick to their own
                    province of more abstract things. In any event, I’m not encountering any more
                    opposition for the time being, and I think it quite possible that that’s how it
                    will remain. A girl I’d often painted was having a child and they thought it was
                    mine, although it wasn’t me. However, knowing the facts of the matter from the
                    girl herself and it being a case in which a member of the priest’s congregation
                    in Nuenen had behaved extremely badly, they can’t get their teeth into me, at
                    least not this time. But you see that it isn’t easy to paint people at home and
                    draw them as they go about their business. Anyway — they won’t easily win in
                    this case, and this winter I do hope to keep the very same models, who are of
                    the old Brabant stock through and through.</p>
                <p>
                    <work stage="finished" origin="new">Even so, I have a few more new
                        drawings.</work>
                </p>
                <p>But now, in the last few days, I could not get anyone in the fields. Fortunately
                    for me, the priest isn’t yet, but is nonetheless beginning to become, quite
                    unpopular. It’s a bad business, though, and if it were to continue I’d probably
                    move. You’ll ask what’s the point of being a disagreeable person — sometimes you
                    have to be. If I’d discussed it meekly they’d have ground me down without mercy.
                    And when they hinder me in my work, sometimes the only way I know is an eye for
                    an eye, a tooth for a tooth. The priest went so far as to promise the people
                    money if they didn’t allow themselves to be painted — however, the people
                    replied very pertly that they’d rather earn it from me than go cap in hand to
                    him. But you see, they only do it for the sake of earning money and I don’t get
                    anything done for nothing around here. You ask me whether Rappard has ever sold
                    anything. I know he’s flusher at present than before, that for a long time, for
                    instance, he had a nude model day after day, that for the purposes of a painting
                    of a brickworks he’s now rented a small house actually on the spot and altered
                    it so that he had light from above — I know that he’s been on another trip
                    through Drenthe and that he’s also going to Terschelling. That all of this is
                    pretty expensive, and the money for it has to come from somewhere. That although
                    he may have money of his own, he must be earning as well, because otherwise he
                    couldn’t do what he’s doing. It may be that his family is buying or friends,
                    that’s possible, but at any rate somebody must be.</p>
                <p>But this evening I’m much too occupied with Lhermitte’s drawings to go on writing
                    any more about other things.</p>
                <p>When I think about Millet or about Lhermitte — then — I find modern art as great
                    — as Michelangelo and Rembrandt — the old infinite, the new infinite too — the
                    old genius, the new genius. Perhaps someone like Chenavard doesn’t see it like
                    this — but for my part I’m convinced — that in this regard one can believe in
                    the present.</p>
                <p>The fact that I have a definite belief as regards art also means that I know what
                    I want to get in my own work, and that I’ll try to get it even if I go under in
                    the attempt. </p>

                1885</date>.</head>
            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>I came across the following sentence that you’d underlined in the article on
                    Chardin in De Goncourt’s book. After speaking about painters being badly paid,
                    he says: ‘What to do, what to become. He must abandon himself to the inferior
                    occupations or die of hunger. The first course is adopted’. So, he goes on to
                    say, aside from a few martyrs, the rest ‘become fencing masters, soldiers or
                    comedians’.</p>
                <p>That really has remained fundamentally true. Seeing as you’d marked the above, I
                    considered it possible you might want to know what I intend to do next,
                    especially since I’ve just informed you that I’ve given notice on my current
                    studio.</p>
                <p>The present day isn’t entirely the same as Chardin’s, and nowadays there are a
                    few things that are hard to argue away. The number of painters is much
                    greater.</p>
                <p>Now it immediately makes a fatal impression on the public if a painter ‘does
                    something on the side’. I’m not at all above that in this respect, I should say
                    keep on painting, make a hundred studies, and if that’s not enough, two hundred,
                    and just see if that doesn’t get you over ‘doing something on the side’. Then
                    accustoming yourself to poverty, seeing how a soldier or a labourer lives and
                    stays healthy in wind and weather with the ordinary people’s food and dwelling,
                    is as practical as earning a guilder or a bit more a week. After all, one’s not
                    in the world for one’s comfort and doesn’t have to be any better off than the
                    next man. Being better off helps hardly at all — after all, we can’t hold on to
                    our youth.</p>
                <p>If that were possible — but the thing that really makes one happy, being young
                    and staying so for a long time — well, that isn’t here — that isn’t even in
                    Arabia or Italy, although that is better there than here.And for my part, I’m of
                    the opinion that one has the greatest chance of staying strong and renewing
                    oneself — in today’s third estate. Anyway. So I’m saying that I seek to find it
                    in painting, without ulterior motives. <stress reason="money">But — I’d do well,
                        I think, to bear portrait painting in mind if I want to earn.</stress> I
                    know it’s difficult to please people with a ‘likeness’, and I dare not say
                    beforehand that I feel sure of my case. I certainly don’t consider it altogether
                    impossible, though, because the people here will be much the same as people
                    elsewhere. Well then, the peasants and the folk from the village aren’t mistaken
                    and promptly say, even contradicting me if I say they’re wrong, that is Renier
                    de Greef, that’s Toon de Groot and that’s Dien van der Beek (and);c. And
                    sometimes even recognize a figure seen from behind. In town, the bourgeois folk,
                    and certainly no less the tarts, no matter who they are, always value portraits.
                    And Millet — discovered that ship’s captains actually ‘respect someone for it’
                    if he can do that (those portraits are probably intended for their mistresses
                    ashore). This hasn’t been exploited yet. Do you remember this in Sensier? I’ve
                    always remembered how Millet kept himself going in Le Havre this way.Well
                    roughly, my plan is to go to Antwerp — I can’t possibly calculate the ins and
                    outs beforehand.</p>
                <p>I’ve come by the addresses of 6 art dealers, so I’d want to take something with
                    me and further, as to the work, I plan to paint a few views of the city as soon
                    as I get there — reasonably large — — and show them straightaway too.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="career">In other words concentrate everything on doing something
                        there. And going there poor, at any rate I can’t lose much.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>Now as regards here — I know the area and the folk too well and love them too
                    much to believe I’m going for good. I’ll see about renting a place to store my
                    things, and then I’m also covered should I want to leave Antwerp for a while —
                    or should become homesick for the country.</p>
                <p>As for ‘doing something on the side’ — right from the outset Tersteeg, for
                    instance, nagged me about it. And that was nagging, whatever else one may think
                    of Tersteeg. Those who talk about it the most aren’t at the same time able to
                    explain precisely what. And as to that, in order to clear the whole thing up in
                    my case — if I did ‘something on the side’, then the only thing would be that,
                    if I knew either dealers or painters, I would possibly do something with
                    paintings, for instance by going to England for them .</p>
                <p>Things like this, which are obviously directly related to painting, are an
                    exception, but otherwise, as a rule, a painter must be wholly a painter.Don’t
                    forget, either, that I’m not cut out to be a melancholic. The nickname I have
                    around here is generally ‘the little painter fellow’, and it’s not entirely
                    without a measure of malice that I’m going there. I’ve also thought of Drenthe,
                    though, but as more difficult to bring about.</p>
                <p>That would be good, though, should my work from the countryside be liked in
                    Antwerp. If the things from here were liked, either now or later, then I would
                    continue with them, and vary them with similar things from Drenthe.</p>
                <p>But the issue is that I can only do one thing at a time, that if I’m engaged in
                    painting peasants, I can’t occupy myself with business in town. <stress
                        reason="money">The present moment is ideal for breaking away, since I’ve had
                        trouble getting models and am going to move in any case.</stress> As to
                    that, it’s to be expected that there would never be an end to it in this studio
                    right next door to the priest and the sacristan. So I’m changing that.But
                    anyway, it doesn’t make an absolute impression on people, and by renting another
                    room and letting things lie for a few months, the intrigue will lose a great
                    deal of its force. Wouldn’t it be best if I could spend the next couple of
                    months, December and January, there? In Amsterdam I lodged in a soup kitchen for
                    50 cents; I’d do the same there, or better yet reach agreement with some painter
                    or other to be allowed to work in his studio. There’s another reason, too — that
                    it’s not absolutely impossible I might find an opportunity somewhere to paint
                    from the nude.</p>
                <p>They wouldn’t want me at the academy, nor probably would I — but — with a
                    sculptor, say, there must surely be a few living there, one might readily find
                    some sympathy. <stress reason="money">It goes without saying that people with
                        money can get as many models as they want, but it’s a difficult matter
                        without it. All the same, there must be people there who use nude models and
                        with whom one could split the cost. I need it for many things.</stress>I
                    received your letter while I was writing to you. I’m willing to go to Van de Loo
                    if need be, only you know that doctors sometimes don’t tell you everything,
                    particularly in doubtful cases. You should also understand that what I said
                    about her being rather in a fog will probably recur, is a thing that most people
                    who are getting old have. In any event I think it a very practical idea not to
                    let her stay in the midst of the upheaval of the removal, unless she absolutely
                    insists. For the rest, old chap, for my part I believe that Van de Loo has given
                    Ma all, absolutely all the advice there was to give, and would say nothing new.
                    I mean, he would already have given a warning if a danger that could be averted
                    were threatening. But if he doesn’t say anything it’s a sign that, if there were
                    something, he can’t do anything about it and nothing should be done about it; if
                    he’s letting nature take its course, he’s doing it because that’s the best thing
                    — Van de Loo is enormously scrupulous and — Zola-like cool and calm. Anyhow —
                    I’ll speak to Wil about it, and either I may go there or Ma may come across Van
                    de Loo sometime when he’s in the village; we’ll do something. But I think it
                    will just have to take its course. Now in such cases, you’ll agree with me,
                    worrying and being overanxious is intolerable for the patient if she notices it.
                    And with old people there’s often no way of predicting it, precisely because in
                    so many cases their hearts aren’t normal, because of fatty degeneration, say,
                    and they can just as easily go off suddenly as carry on for another 5, another
                    10 years. Emotion can have an effect, of course, but precisely because of this
                    there’s much more chance of staying alive if the mind is no longer all too
                    clear, than in periods of lucidity. Something else — I’m quite sure that, from
                    time to time at least, there’s definitely a substratum of deep thoughts in Ma
                    (for her inner life, her life of the mind is fairly complicated and has levels
                    or layers) that she neither wants to nor could express. In many cases she was
                    rather silent, so — I for one would rather say that I don’t always know
                    everything about her. Particularly now that she’s lucid, letting her do as she
                    wants is certainly the easiest, firstly for her and secondly the most sensible
                    for us.Silently understanding how it would by no means be a misfortune for her
                    were it to be that she didn’t live very much longer and departed without much
                    suffering, serenity is justifiable in this regard. Serenity too, though, were it
                    to be that years of relatively mechanical life remained.</p>
                <p>You see that I wanted to arrange my going to Antwerp at around the same time as
                    their trip, which will be over around February. Between then and their final
                    move, I’ll either be back in Nuenen or — if something exceptional detained me
                    longer, nonetheless always ready to be present right away if something
                    happened.</p>
                <p>This must go off, but I’ll write in a few days and tell you what I’ve arranged
                    with Wil. I’ll suggest she goes to Van de Loo with Ma before the trip; that
                    would go without saying for Ma. Once Van de Loo has seen her, that will be the
                    moment for either Wil or me to ask Van de Loo outright whether he can say
                    anything about her life expectancy. For my part, depending on what you and Wil
                    think about it, I’m willing to prepare Van de Loo before Ma’s visit, and tell
                    him what we’d like to know, so that he gives her a really thorough examination.

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>I’ll tell you in a few words what Van de Loo said about Ma. He says</p>
                <p>1) that there’s nothing wrong with her</p>
                <p>2) that she can live for another 10 years or so</p>
                <p>3) that if she dies before that time, then she would have to have contracted some
                    disease or other.</p>
                <p>Lastly, he seemed to find it very natural that she was sometimes a little bit
                    dazed, and didn’t make anything of it.</p>
                <p>So she can do whatever she likes and doesn’t have to feel awkward about
                    travelling or moving house.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="family">So much the better, then. In any event it’s
                        reassuring. Because for my part I believe what he says, and with the good
                        care that Ma gets thanks to Wil there’s little chance of ‘contracting some
                        disease or other’.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>Wanted to let you know straightaway. It’s reassuring for me, too.I’m really
                    looking forward to Antwerp now. The first thing I’ll do there will probably be
                    to go and see Leys’s paintings in his dining room, if one can see them. You
                    know, that Walk on the ramparts and the one that Bracquemond etched, The table,
                    The servant.</p>
                <p>I imagine that it’ll be beautiful there in the winter, too, with snow on the
                    docks. Obviously I’ll take a few paintings with me, and they’ll be the ones that
                    I would otherwise have sent to you in the next few days.</p>
                <p>A large mill on the heath in the evening, and a view of the village behind a row
                    of poplars with yellow leaves, a still life and a number of drawings of
                    figures.</p>
                <p>I’m at something of a stand with the work here at present. It’s freezing hard, so
                    it’s no longer possible to work outdoors. It’s better if I just don’t use any
                    more models as long as I’m living in this house; at any rate not until I come
                    back. Besides, I’m saving my paint and canvas so as to have ammunition
                        there.<stress reason="environment">SO THE SOONER I CAN GET AWAY, THE
                        BETTER.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="career">I recently received a letter from Leurs about my
                        paintings. He wrote that Tersteeg and Wisselingh had seen them and thought
                        them ‘not suitable for them’.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>All the same, I maintain that I’ll make people change their minds — even if
                    Tersteeg and Wisselingh don’t want to.</p>
                <p>I’ve just read a few books in the style of Gigoux’s Souvenirs, which my friend in
                    Eindhoven had sent for, in which I found some very interesting things about the
                    fellows of those days, starting with Paul Huet. <unstress reason="career">And
                        which give me confidence that I haven’t tackled nature the wrong way, nor
                        the technique of painting, although I freely admit that I will and must
                        still change.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>There you have those heads that are with you, there must be good ones among them,
                    I’m as good as certain of it. So — let’s go.</p>
                <p>I don’t think this winter will be dull. It’s obvious that it’ll mainly be a
                    question of working hard. But there’s something singular in the very idea that
                    one has to take the plunge.</p>
                <p>I’m taking a stock of the paint that I can easily get ground here myself — but
                    it’ll help me if I can find a few more colours in a better quality there. I’m
                    also taking at least 40 stretching frames the same size as those studies of
                    heads that are with you. And drawing materials and paper so that, however I get
                    on, I’ll always be able to do something. Because I’ve worked entirely alone for
                    years, I imagine that although I will and although I can learn from others and
                    even adopt technical things — all the same I’ll always see through my own eyes
                    and tackle things originally.</p>
                <p>However, nothing could be surer than that I’ll try to learn more things. And if I
                    can — particularly the nude figure. <stress reason="money">I imagine, though,
                        that in order to get models, as many as I want and good, I won’t be done all
                        at once, but will have to find the money for it by making other
                        things.</stress> Be it landscapes, be it townscapes, be it portraits, as I
                    said — or — even if it were signboards and decoration. Or — something I didn’t
                    mention in my last letter among the things that I could do ‘on the side’ — give
                    lessons in painting, letting them begin by painting still lifes — which I
                    believe is a different method from that of the drawing masters. I’ve tried it
                    out on those friends of mine in Eindhoven, and I’d dare repeat it.</p>
                <p>I’ll certainly leave immediately, as soon as I get the monthly allowance from
                    you. And as to that, should you by chance be in a position to send it a week
                    earlier, I’d leave a week earlier. It goes without saying, though, that I’m not
                    counting on it. I’m glad that I went to see the museum in Amsterdam once more
                    before this, because I’ve seen from the work since that what I saw there has
                    been useful to me. Write soon if you have time. I wanted to tell you Van de
                    Loo’s opinion of Ma straightaway.Since I’m already busy packing up my things, it
                    goes without saying that my thoughts are more there than here.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="career">Here I’ve just kept on ceaselessly painting in order to
                        learn painting, to get firm ideas about colour, without leaving much room in
                        my head for other things.</stress>
                    <unstress reason="environment">But when I escaped to Amsterdam for a few days, I
                        was really delighted to see paintings once again.</unstress> For it’s
                    sometimes damned hard to be entirely away from paintings and the world of
                    painters and not to see anything by other people. Since then I’ve had quite a
                    yearning to get back into it, at least for a while.</p>
                <p>If one’s entirely out of it for a couple of years and wrestles with nature, that
                    can sometimes help, and at the same time one perhaps gets a new stock of
                    confidence and health out of it, which one can under no circumstances have too
                    much of, though, because the painter’s life is often harsh enough.As regards my
                    work, I’ll have to act according to circumstances, I mean, if I could perhaps
                    make the acquaintance of an art buyer and persuade him to show some of my
                    things. But tomorrow doesn’t mean never, and you’ll soon see something of it,
                    particularly if I succeed in making new studies of heads or figures. <work

            <body>
                <p>
                    <bad_health>I already wrote to you the day before yesterday that on the one hand
                        I was far from well,</bad_health>
                    <unstress reason="environment">but that on the other hand I nevertheless thought
                        I could see some light.</unstress>

                <p>
                    <stress reason="career">However, I regret that I have to tell you even more
                        categorically that I’m most definitely literally exhausted and
                        overworked.</stress> When you think that I went to live in my own studio on
                    1 May — since then it’s perhaps been a matter of 6 or 7 times, so far, that I’ve
                    had my midday meal. For good reasons, <stress reason="family">I don’t want you
                        to tell Ma that I’m not well</stress> — because she might possibly consider
                    that it wasn’t nice that what happened, happened, that’s to say that I didn’t
                    stay there — precisely because of these consequences. I shan’t say anything
                    about it; don’t you say anything either. But I lived then, and since then, here,
                        <stress reason="money">having nothing for my food because the work cost me
                        too much and I relied too much on the idea that I could stick it out like
                        this.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>What the doctor tells me is that I absolutely must live better, and that I have
                    to take more care of myself with my work until I’m stronger. It’s total
                    debilitation.</p>
                <p>
                    <bad_health>Well I’ve made it worse by smoking a lot,</bad_health> which I did
                    all the more because then one isn’t troubled by one’s empty stomach.</p>
                <p>Anyway, they say — one has to experience lean times, and I’ve had my share of
                    them.</p>
                <p>
                    <bad_health>Because it’s not just the food, it’s also all the worry and sorrow
                        that one has.</bad_health>
                </p>
                <p>You know that for one reason or another the time in Nuenen was far from carefree
                    for me. What’s more — here — <unstress reason="environment">I’m very pleased to
                        have come here </unstress>— <stress reason="environment">but it’s been a
                        difficult time all the same.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="money">What we have to do and what is largely lacking — is this.
                        Paying the models ourselves is too much; as long as one doesn’t have enough
                        money,</stress> one must take advantage of the opportunities at the studios,
                    like Verlat, like Cormon. And one must be in the artists’ world and work at
                    clubs where one shares the cost of the models.</p>
                <p>Now it’s true that I didn’t think of this before, or at least didn’t do it — but
                    I wish now that I’d started on it a year earlier. If we could now find some way
                    of living in the same city it would be far and away the best thing, at least for
                    the time being.</p>
                <p>Only, the more I think about it, the more and more I fancy that it might be
                    better not to spend much on a studio in the first year, because I’ll mostly have
                    to draw in that first year.</p>
                <p>Because speaking of Cormon — I imagine he would tell me much the same as Verlat
                    says — that I have to draw nudes or plaster casts for up to a year, precisely
                    because I’ve always drawn from life.</p>
                <p>This isn’t really a harsh requirement, because I tell you that there are people
                    here who’ve been in the class for 3 years and are still not allowed to stop, who
                    also paint. In that year I have to practise the male and the female figure, both
                    in detail and as a whole, and — then I’ll know it by heart, as it were. Drawing
                    in itself, technically, is easy enough for me — I’m beginning to do it the way
                    one writes, with the same ease. But precisely at this level it becomes more
                    interesting, as one is not satisfied with the facility that one gradually
                    acquires but really looks for originality and breadth of conception. Drawing the
                    masses rather than the outlines. Solid modelling. And I can assure you it’s not
                    a bad sign if people like Verlat or Cormon, let’s say, demand that of someone.
                    For there are enough of them that Verlat simply leaves to get on with it because
                    — they just aren’t the fellows for the loftier figure. You talk about the clever
                    fellows at Cormon’s studio. Precisely because I damned well want to be one of
                    them, I’m setting myself in advance, out of my own conviction, the requirement
                    of spending at least a year in Paris mainly drawing from the nude and plaster
                    casts. For the rest, let’s do whatsoever our hand finds to do in the way of
                    painting, if an effect out of doors strikes us or we happen to have a good model
                    (and);c.</p>
                <p>And don’t think that this is the long way, because it’s the short one. Someone
                    who can draw his figures from memory is much more productive than someone who
                    can’t. And by my taking the trouble to spend that year drawing — you’ll just see
                    how productive we become. And don’t think either that the years I worked out of
                    doors were wasted. For it’s the very thing that people who’ve never been
                    anywhere else but at academies and studios lack, that view of reality in which
                    they live, and finding subjects. Anyway.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="money">Might it not be wise if we put off renting a studio at
                        least for the first six months, precisely because it all comes down to the
                        money? </stress>But otherwise I like the idea of setting up a studio a great
                    deal, a very great deal. Even, if need be, such that one could combine with
                    other painters to take models together. The more energy the better. And in hard
                    times — one must especially seek a way out in friendship and collaboration.</p>
                <p>But Theo, it’s so rotten about this indisposition — I’m dreadfully sorry — but
                    I’m still in good spirits. It will get better. You understand that it would have
                    got worse and worse if I’d delayed doing something about it.</p>
                <p>What I think, though, is this — one mustn’t think that people whose constitution
                    is damaged, wholly or half, aren’t fit for painting. It’s desirable for one to
                    make it to 60 at least, and necessary for one to make it to 50, if one begins
                    when one is around 30.</p>
                <p>But one absolutely doesn’t have to be perfectly healthy; one may have all sorts
                    of things wrong. The work doesn’t always suffer as a result — on the contrary,
                    nervous fellows are more sensitive and more refined. But Theo, precisely because
                    it has proved in my case that my health leaves something to be desired — I’ve
                    decided to concentrate specifically on the loftier figure and to try to refine
                    myself. I<bad_health>t really struck me so unexpectedly — I did feel weak and
                        feverish, but I still kept going. Only it began to worry me that teeth were
                        breaking off one after another. And that I was starting to look worse and
                        worse. Anyway, we’ll see about putting it right.</bad_health>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <bad_health>I think that getting the teeth attended to will help in itself
                        because, as my mouth was usually painful, I just swallowed my food as
                        quickly as possible</bad_health>.</p>
                <p>And perhaps it will also help my appearance, at least a little.</p>
                <p>As regards this month, I’ve paid 25 francs in advance for my room, 30 francs in
                    advance for my food, and 50 francs to the dentist; also a visit to the doctor
                    and some drawing materials — which leaves 6 francs.</p>
                <p>
                    <bad_health>Now the important issue this month is not to be ill, which isn’t
                        easy to resolve — and which could very well happen.</bad_health> But we’ll
                    see — I still think I’ve got a certain toughness in common with the peasants,
                    who also don’t eat anything very special and still go on living and working. So
                    don’t worry too much about it. If you could send a little bit extra, very well —
                    but if you can’t, I’ll wait calmly to see how it goes. <bad_health>What I don’t
                        like is that I’m feverish, </bad_health>and I reason about it thus: although
                    I may be weakened, I’ve still taken some care not to eat any unwholesome food.
                    Overexertion isn’t excessive either — because, despite everything, I keep my
                    spirits up all the time — so that it’s because I’m weak that I overexert myself.
                    It seems to me that it must sort itself out. You understand, though, that if it
                    were to get worse — and took a virulent turn — one might have to contend with
                    typhus or at least typhoid fever.</p>
                <p>And actually the only reasons why I certainly don’t expect that are these — 1
                    that I’ve had a great deal of fresh air, and 2 that, as I said, even though I’ve
                    evidently not fed myself well enough, as a precaution I’ve nonetheless made do
                    with very simple food rather than the muck in the cheap restaurants — and 3 —
                    that I have a degree of calm and serenity in the face of things.</p>
                <p>So we must wait and see. Don’t you worry about it, because not even I do — I
                    maintain that, supposing I do get a fever, I’ve lived and eaten too simply for
                    it to become very virulent all that easily. After all, things don’t happen of
                    their own accord, and there’s a reason for everything. Write to me soon, though,
                    because I really do need it.</p>
                <p>As regards going to Nuenen too — I want to know what you’d think best.</p>
                <p>But I’m not needed there — because someone like Rijken, the gardener, for
                    instance, can see to what needs to be packed or sent at least as well as I
                    can.</p>
                <p>If there’s any point in it, though, I can be ready by March if need be.</p>

            <head>
                <location>Antwerp</location>, on or about Saturday, <date>6 February
                1886</date>.</head>
            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>I’ve received your letter and 25 francs enclosed and I thank you very much for
                    both. I’m really glad that you like my plan to come to Paris. I believe it will
                    help me make progress and at the same time that, if I didn’t go, I might easily
                    get into a mess, keep moving around in the same circle too much, persist in the
                    same mistakes. Furthermore, as for you, I don’t think that coming home to a
                    studio would do you any harm. For the rest, I have to tell you the same about me
                    as you write about yourself — I’ll disappoint you.</p>
                <p>And even so, this is the way to combine forces. And even so, much greater
                    understanding of each other can follow from it.</p>
                <p>Now what shall I tell you about my health? <bad_health>I still believe that I
                        have a chance of avoiding being really ill; all the same, I’ll need time to
                        get better. I also still have two more teeth to be filled, then my upper
                        jaw, which was most affected, will be all right again.</bad_health>
                    <stress reason="money">I still have to pay 10 francs for that, and then another
                        40 francs to get the bottom half right too.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>Some years of those 10 years that I appear to have spent in prison will disappear
                    as a result. Because bad teeth, which one so seldom sees any more as it’s so
                    easy to get them put right, since bad teeth give a physiognomy a sort of sunken
                    look.</p>
                <p>And then — even eating the same things, one can naturally digest better when one
                    can chew properly, and so my stomach will have a chance to recover.</p>
                <p>I really do notice that I’ve been at a very low ebb, though — and as you wrote
                    yourself, all sorts of things that are even worse could arise out of neglecting
                    it. However, we’ll see that we get it put right.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="career">I haven’t worked for a few days, gone to bed early a
                        couple of nights (otherwise it was usually 1 or 2 o’clock because of drawing
                        at the club). And I feel that it’s calming me.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>I’ve had a note from Ma, who writes that they’re going to start packing in
                    March.</p>
                <p>Further, since you say you’ll have to pay rent until the end of June — well then,
                    perhaps it would be best after all if I were to return to Nuenen, starting in
                    March, only — if I encountered opposition and scenes like I got before I left, I
                    would be wasting my time there and so, even if it were only just for those few
                    months, I’d make a change anyhow, since I want to have some new things from the
                    country ready to bring to Paris with me.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="environment">That Siberdt, the teacher of the antique, who spoke
                        to me at first as I told you, definitely tried to pick a quarrel with me
                        today, perhaps with a view to getting rid of me.</stress> Which didn’t work
                    inasmuch as I said — Why are you trying to pick a quarrel with me? I have no
                    wish to quarrel, and in any case I have absolutely no desire to contradict you,
                    but you deliberately try to pick a quarrel with me.</p>
                <p>He evidently hadn’t expected that and couldn’t say much to refute it this time,
                    but — next time, of course, he’ll be able to start something.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="friendship">The issue behind it is that the fellows in the class
                        are talking about things in my work among themselves, and I’ve said, not to
                        Siberdt but outside the class to some of the fellows, that their drawings
                        were completely wrong.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>Bear in mind that if I go to Cormon and run into trouble sooner or later either
                    with the master or the pupils, I wouldn’t let it worry me. If need be, even if I
                    didn’t have a master, I could also go through the antique course by going to
                    draw in the Louvre or somewhere. And so I’d do that if I had to — although I’d
                    far rather have correction — as long as it doesn’t become DELIBERATE
                    provocation; that correction without one giving any cause other than a certain
                    singularity in one’s manner of working which is different from the others. If he
                    starts on me again, I’ll say out loud in the class, I’m happy to do mechanically
                    everything that you tell me to do, because I’m determined to pay you back what
                    is your due, if need be, if you insist on it, but — as far as mechanizing me as
                    you mechanize the others is concerned, that has not, I assure you, the slightest
                    hold over me.</p>
                <p>Besides, you started by telling me something quite different, that’s to say, you
                    told me: tackle it as you wish.</p>
                <p>The reason why I’m drawing plaster casts — not to start from the outline, but to
                    start from the centres— I haven’t got it yet, but I feel it more and more and —
                    I’ll certainly carry on with it, it’s too interesting.</p>
                <p>I wish that we could spend a few days together in the Louvre and could just talk
                    about it. I believe it would interest you.</p>
                <p>This morning I sent you Chérie, mainly for the preface, which will certainly
                    strike you.</p>
                <p>And — I wish that at the end of our lives we could also walk somewhere together
                    and — looking back, say — we’ve done this — and that’s one; and that — and
                    that’s two; and that — and that’s three. And if we want to and dare to — will
                    there be anything to talk about then?</p>
                <p>We can try two things — making something good ourselves — collecting things by
                    other people that we think are good, and dealing in them. But we must both live
                    rather more robustly, and perhaps combining forces is a step towards becoming
                    more robust.</p>
                <p>But now allow me to touch on a delicate matter — if I’ve said unpleasant things
                    to you, specifically about our upbringing and our home, this has been because
                    we’re in an area where being critical is essential in order for us to get along
                    with and understand each other and cooperate in business.</p>
                <p>Now I can well understand that one can passionately love something or someone
                    that one can’t do anything about.</p>
                <p>Very well — I won’t go into that except in so far as it might make a fatal
                    separation between us where reconciliation is needed.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="family">And our upbringing — won’t prove to be so good that
                        we’ll retain many illusions about it — there you are — and we might perhaps
                        have been happier with a different upbringing. But if we stick to the
                        positive idea of wanting to produce and to be something, then we’ll be able,
                        without getting angry, to discuss faits accomplis as such when it’s
                        unavoidable and might perhaps touch on or directly concern the Goupils or
                        the family. And for the rest, these issues between us are for the
                        understanding of the situation and not out of rancour. </stress>But if we
                    undertake something it won’t be a matter of indifference to either of us to
                    improve our health, because we need time alive — some 25 or 30 years of working
                    constantly. There’s so much of interest in the present age when one thinks how
                    very possible it is that we may well yet see the beginning of the end of a
                    society. And just as there is infinite poetry in the autumn or in a sunset, and
                    then there’s so much soul and mysterious endeavour in nature, so it is now. And
                    as for art — decline, if you will, after the Delacroix, Corots, Millets, Duprés,
                    Troyons, Bretons, Rousseaux, Daubignys — very well — but a decline so full of
                    charm — that there truly is still an immense, immense amount of good things to
                    come, and they’re being made every day.</p>
                <p>I’m longing dreadfully for the Louvre, Luxembourg etc., where everything will be
                    so new to me.</p>
                <p>For the rest of my life I’ll regret that I didn’t see the Cent chefs d’oeuvre,
                    the Delacroix exhibition and the Meissonier exhibition. But there will still be
                    plenty of opportunities to catch up. It’s true, for instance, that wanting to
                    progress too quickly here, I may actually have progressed less, but what would
                    you? My health is also behind it, and if I regain that as I hope to do, then my
                    taking pains will have been less in vain. After all, I believe that if one asks
                    permission, one may draw plaster casts in the Louvre, even if one isn’t at
                    L’Ecole des BeauxArts.</p>
                <p>It wouldn’t surprise me if, once the idea of living together takes hold, you’ll
                    find it odder and odder that we’ve been together so surprisingly little, if you
                    will — for fully 10 years.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I most certainly hope that this will be the end of it, and that it won’t
                    begin again.</p>
                <p>What you say about the apartment is perhaps really rather expensive. I mean, I’d
                    be just as happy if it weren’t quite as good.</p>
                <p>I’m curious as to how those few months in Nuenen will be for me. Since I have
                    some furniture there, since it’s beautiful there, too, and I know the district a
                    little, it might be a good thing for me to keep a piedàterre there, if need be
                    in an inn where I could leave that furniture, since otherwise it will be lost —
                    and it could still come in very useful.</p>
                <p>There’s sometimes the most to do by returning to old places. I must finish this
                    now, since I’m going to the club.</p>
                <p>Keep thinking about what we can best do. </p>

                <location>Antwerp</location>, on or about Tuesday, <date>9 February
                1886</date>.</head>
            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>I have to write to you one more time because the sooner we can take an outright
                    decision the better. As regards a studio — if we could find, in one and the same
                    house, a room with an alcove and also a garret or a corner attic — then you
                    could have that apartment of room and alcove, and we could make it just as
                    comfortable as possible. And during the day the room could serve as studio, and
                    the garret could serve for various more unsightly tools or for dirty work, and I
                    could also sleep there — and you in the studio alcove.</p>
                <p>It seems to me that such an arrangement or something similar would be perfectly
                    satisfactory for the first year. <stress reason="family">What I’m not sure about
                        is whether we’ll get on personally, although I don’t despair of it — but
                        it’ll be much more agreeable for you to come home to a workplace than to an
                        ordinary room, which always has something gloomy about it. And it’s that
                        gloom that’s our worst enemy.</stress> When the doctor tells me that I have
                    to take better care of myself, physically — well, who knows whether such a
                    measure mightn’t do you good too. <bad_health>For you’re also neither happy nor
                        in good spirits — let’s not mince words, you have too much worry and too
                        little prosperity.</bad_health>
                </p>
                <p>But perhaps it’s because of our policy that we’re each too much alone and our
                    forces and resources are too divided, and in that form insufficient. So — unity
                    is strength — would certainly be much better.</p>
                <p>So there has to be more life, it seems to me, and we have to throw out all sorts
                    of doubts and a certain lack of confidence.</p>
                <p>Do you want a reason on which one can rely to preserve one’s serenity, even when
                    one stands alone and isn’t understood and one’s material wellbeing has gone by
                    the board? Well there’s still this — I believe — one feels instinctively that a
                    tremendous amount is changing, and everything will change. <stress
                        reason="environment">We’re in the last quarter of a century that will end
                        with another colossal revolution.But suppose we both yet see the beginning
                        of it at the end of our lives.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>We’ll certainly not experience the better times of clear air and refreshment of
                    the whole of society after those great storms. All the same, it’s something not
                    to be taken in by the falseness of one’s time, in so far as one detects in it
                    the unhealthy closeness and mugginess of the hours that precede the
                    thunderstorm.</p>
                <p>And says — it’s oppressive for us — but the next generations will be able to
                    breathe more freely. Men like Zola and the De Goncourts believe in it with the
                    simplicity of overgrown children. They, the most rigorous analysts — whose
                    diagnosis is both so merciless and so accurate.</p>
                <p>And particularly the one you mentioned, Turgenev, and Daudet — they don’t work
                    without a goal or without looking towards the other side.</p>
                <p>Only they all, and rightly, avoid prophesying utopias and are pessimists in so
                    far as if one analyzes, one sees so terribly in the history of this century the
                    way the revolutions fail, no matter how nobly they begin.</p>
                <p>You see, where one gets support is when one doesn’t always have to walk alone
                    with one’s feelings and thoughts, when one works and thinks in a group of people
                    together. Then at the same time one can do more — and one is infinitely
                    happier.</p>
                <p>Well I’d already wanted to have that between us for a long time, and you see, I
                    imagine that if you stayed on your own you’d become depressed because the times
                    aren’t encouraging unless one finds satisfaction in one’s work. I’m sending you
                    that novel by De Goncourt specifically for the introduction above all — which
                    contains a résumé of their works and aims.</p>
                <p>Y<bad_health>ou’ll see that these fellows haven’t been precisely happy, in the
                        same way as Delacroix said about himself, I haven’t been happy at all in the
                        sense in which I understood it / wanted it in the past</bad_health>.</p>
                <p>Well, whether or not it comes soon — a moment will come for you, too, when you’ll
                    be sure that material wellbeing has gone by the board, fatally and irrevocably.
                    I’d safely dare say that, but adding this, that I think that at that same moment
                    there will be a certain compensation of feeling a capacity for work.</p>
                <p>What touches me is the magnificent serenity of the great thinkers of the present
                    day, like, say, the last walk of the two De Goncourts, which you’ll find
                    described. The last days of the ageing Turgenev were like that, too — he was
                    with Daudet a great deal then. Sensitive, subtle, intelligent as women,
                    sensitive to their own suffering, too, and always still full of life and
                    selfassurance, no indifferent stoicism, no contempt for life — I say again,
                    those fellows, they die like women die. No idée fixe about God or abstractions —
                    always on the ground floor of life itself and attached only to that, again, like
                    women who have loved much — touched and — as Silvestre says of Delacroix — thus
                    died, almost smiling.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, we haven’t yet reached that point, on the contrary we’re at the point
                    of working first, living first — most likely with the normal kind of wellbeing
                    going by the board. But whatever the future may be, you can be sure that I’d be
                    very pleased indeed if I could work with Cormon for a year or so, unless there’s
                    somewhere better for drawing in L’Ecole des BeauxArts or other studios I’ve
                    heard about here.</p>
                <p>The ancients won’t prevent us from being realistic, come on — on the contrary. Of
                    course I’m also desperately longing for French paintings.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="love">Apropos, don’t you like this?Everything that is bad came
                        from woman — Clouded Reason, an appetite for lucre, betrayal Golden cups in
                        which wines are mixed with lees. Every crime, every happy lie, every kind of
                        madness</stress>
                </p>
                <p>Comes from her..... Adore her none the less, since the gods Made her... and — she
                    is the best thing that they have made. After all, working has the secret of
                    being able to give someone a second youth.</p>
                <p>Tell me, have you ever read anything by Carlyle? Actually that’s not necessary
                    when one sees the fellow’s face and knows his work is something like Michelet.
                    Whistler and Legros have both made his portrait. That’s another one who dared a
                    great deal and had a different insight on many things from the rest. But the
                    more I look into it, always the same story — lack of money, poor health,
                    opposition, isolation, in short, trouble from beginning to end.</p>
                <p>Mantz’s piece about Paul Baudry was very good, and I found that ‘he worked on the
                    renewal of the smile’ particularly singular.</p>
                <p>Could one say of Delacroix ‘he worked on the renewal of passion’? Perhaps so.
                    Anyway — do write soon in any event, and regards.</p>

                1886</date>.</head>
            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="family">I definitely need to tell you that it would reassure me
                        greatly if you were to approve my coming to Paris much earlier than June or
                        July if need be. The more I think about it, the more desirable this appears
                        to me.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>Consider that if everything goes well and if I had good food throughout that
                    time, which will certainly not be plain sailing, consider that even in that case
                    it will take 6 months or so before I’m entirely well.</p>
                <p>But it would certainly take even longer if things were to be the same for me in
                    Brabant from March to July as they’ve been for the past few months, and it’s
                    likely they’d be no different.</p>
                <p>
                    <bad_health>Now at the moment it’s just because of reaction to overexertion that
                        I feel terribly weak, in fact even worse. Still, that’s the natural course
                        of things and nothing unusual.</bad_health>
                </p>
                <p>But where the issue is — to take better care of oneself —<stress reason="money">
                        well in Brabant I’d wear myself out again taking models, the same old story
                        would start all over again, and it doesn’t seem to me that any good could
                        come of it.</stress> That way — we’d be straying from the path. So please
                    give me permission to come sooner if need be. In fact I’d say right away, if
                    need be. If I take a garret in Paris, bring my painting box and drawing
                    materials with me — then as far as the work’s concerned I can finish the most
                    pressing things at once — those studies of plaster casts that will certainly
                    help me when I go to Cormon’s. <work origin="new" stage="planned">I can go and
                        draw either in the Louvre or in L’Ecole des BeauxArts.</work>
                </p>
                <p>For the rest, we could then also think about it and discuss it so much better
                    before we go about setting ourselves up somewhere else.</p>
                <p>Know that I don’t mind going to Nuenen in the month of March if need be and
                    seeing how things are there, and how the people are, and whether or not I can
                    get models.</p>
                <p>But if that doesn’t work out, which is likely, then after March I could come
                    straight to Paris and start drawing, in the Louvre, for instance. I’ve given a
                    lot of thought to what you wrote about taking a studio — but it seems to me that
                    it would be a good thing if we were to look for it together and that before we
                    start living together permanently — did it for a while — provisionally — and I
                    started by renting a garret at the beginning of April, say, until June. Then
                    I’ll be more accustomed to Paris again by the time I go to Cormon’s. </p>
                <p>And — I think this way I’ll remain more cheerful. I also have to tell you that
                    although I still go there — <stress reason="friendship">it’s often insupportable
                        for me, the carping of the fellows at the academy, for it has proved that
                        they’re still spiteful.</stress> However, I make a point of avoiding any
                    quarrel, and go my own way. And I think I’m getting on the track of what I’m
                    looking for, and perhaps I might find it even sooner if I were to sit in front
                    of the plaster casts entirely on my own. All the same, I’m glad I went to the
                    academy, if only because I have ample opportunity to observe the results of
                    starting from the outline, because they do that systematically and they pick
                    petty quarrels with me about it. Make an outline first — your outline isn’t
                    right — I won’t correct that if you model before having conscientiously finished
                    your outline. You see, it all comes down to that. And you really should see!!!
                    how flat, how dead and how bloody boring the results of that system are. Oh, I
                    tell you, I’m very glad to have seen it properly at close quarters — David or
                    even worse — Pieneman in full bloom. I must have wanted to say at least
                    twentyfive times — your outline’s just a trick — but I haven’t thought it
                    worthwhile arguing. All the same, even though I don’t say anything, I irritate
                    them — and they me.</p>
                <p>This doesn’t matter so much, though — the issue is to really go on trying to find
                    a better system of working. So, patience and perseverance.</p>
                <p>They go so far as to say — colour and modelling, that’s nothing, one learns that
                    very quickly — it’s the outline that’s the essential thing and the most
                    difficult. You see, one can learn something new at the academy — I never knew
                    before that colour and modelling came of their own accord. <work origin="new"
                        stage="finished">Just yesterday I finished a drawing that I’ve made for the
                        competition in the evening class. It’s the Germanicus figure that you
                        know.</work> Very well — I know for sure that I’ll certainly come last,
                    because all the drawings by the others are the same, and mine is completely
                    different. But I saw the drawing that will be considered to be the best being
                    done — I was sitting just behind — and it’s correct, it’s anything you like, but
                    it’s dead and so are all those drawings that I saw.</p>
                <p>Enough about this — just let it bore us so much that we become enthusiastic about
                    something nobler. And that we make haste to achieve it.</p>
                <p>You also need to take better care of yourself, and should we succeed in uniting,
                    the two of us would know more than each one individually, and could do more.</p>
                <p>Tell me, did you notice that subtle remark of Paul Mantz’s — women are perhaps
                    the supreme difficulty in life — it was in the article on Baudry? We’ll
                    certainly experience our share of that, aside from what we may already have
                    experienced. It struck me in a chapter from Zola’s L’oeuvre in Gil Blas — that
                    the painter — Manet, of course — had a scene with a woman who had posed for him
                    and had then cooled to the idea; oh curiously well described. What one can learn
                    at the academy in this regard is — just don’t paint women then. They hardly ever
                    use nude female models, not at all in class at any rate — very occasionally
                    individually.</p>
                <p>Even in the plaster cast class, 10 male figures as against 1 female figure.
                    That’s nice and easy.</p>
                <p>That must surely be better in Paris — and it occurs to me that one actually
                    learns so much by constantly comparing male and female, which are always so very
                    different in everything. It may be the supreme difficulty, but what would art
                    and what would life be without that? Regards, write back about this soon, with a
                    handshake.</p>

                <p>My being in Nuenen, at least for the month of March, would be because of the

            <salutation>My dear friend,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Enclosed a letter that arrived yesterday but which the concierge didn’t pass on
                    to me straightaway.</p>
                <p>I’ve been to the Tambourin, because if I didn’t go there people would have
                    thought I didn’t dare.</p>
                <p>So I told Miss Segatori that I wouldn’t pass judgement on her over this affair,
                    but that it was up to her to judge herself.</p>
                <p>That I’d torn up the receipt for the paintings — but that she had to give
                    everything back. </p>
                <p>That if she hadn’t had something to do with what happened to me she would have
                    come to see me the next day.</p>
                <p>That as she didn’t come to see me I would take it that she knew people were
                    trying to pick a fight with me, but that she’d tried to warn me by saying — go
                    away — which I didn’t understand, and besides would perhaps not have wanted to
                    understand. To which she replied that the paintings and all the rest were at my
                    disposal.</p>
                <p>She claimed that I’d tried to pick a fight — which doesn’t surprise me — knowing
                    that appalling things would be done to her if she took my side.</p>
                <p>I also saw the waiter on my way in, but he made himself scarce.</p>
                <p>Now I didn’t want to take the paintings straightaway, but I said that when you
                    got back we’d have a chat about it, because those paintings belonged to you as
                    much as to me, and while waiting I urged her to think again about what had
                    happened.</p>
                <p>She didn’t look well and she was as pale as wax, which isn’t a good sign. She
                    didn’t know that the waiter had gone up to your place. If that’s true — I would
                    be even more inclined to believe it was more the case that she’d tried to warn
                    me people were trying to pick a fight with me, than that she’d been up to
                    something herself. She can’t do as she’d like. Now I’ll wait till you get back
                    before doing anything.</p>
                <p>
                    <work origin="new" stage="finished">I’ve done two paintings since you
                        left.</work>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <work origin="new" stage="planned">Now I have two louis left, and I fear I won’t
                        know how to get through the days from now till you get back.</work>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="friendship">Because remember when I started working at Asnières
                        I had lots of canvases and Tanguy was very good to me. He still is, when it
                        comes down to it, but his old witch of a wife noticed what was going on and
                        objected to it. Now I gave Tanguy’s wife a piece of my mind and said it was
                        her fault if I wouldn’t buy anything else from them. Père Tanguy’s wise
                        enough to keep quiet, and he’ll do what I ask of him all the
                    same</stress>.</p>
                <p>But with all that it isn’t easy to work.</p>
                <p>I saw Lautrec today, he’s sold a painting, through Portier, I think. </p>
                <p>Someone brought in a watercolour by Mrs Mesdag, which I find very beautiful.</p>
                <p>Now I hope you’ll enjoy your visit over there, give my mother, Cor and Wil my
                    warm regards. And if you can see that I’m not in too much trouble from now till
                    you get back by sending me something more, I’ll try to make some more paintings
                    for you — because I’m perfectly calm as far as my work goes.</p>
                <p>What bothered me a bit in this business was that by not going (to the Tambourin)
                    it looked cowardly. And having gone there restored my peace of mind. </p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo, </salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Thanks for your kind letter and the 50-franc note. <stress reason="money">So far
                        I’m not finding living here as profitable as I might have hoped</stress>,
                    but I’ve finished <work stage="finished" origin="new">three studies</work>,
                    which I would probably not have been able to do in Paris these days. I was glad
                    the news from Holland was fairly satisfactory. As far as Reid goes, I wouldn’t
                    be very surprised if — (wrongly, however) — he took it badly that I went to the
                    south before him. For us to say we’d never have benefited from knowing him would
                    be relatively unfair since, 1, he made us a gift of a very fine painting (which
                    painting, let it be said by the way, we intended to acquire), 2, Reid made
                    Monticellis go up in value, and since we own 5 of them the result for us is that
                    these paintings have increased in value — 3, he was good and pleasant company in
                    the first months. </p>
                <p>Now for our part we wanted him to take part in a bigger deal than the Monticelli
                    one, and he pretended not to understand very much about it. It seems to me that
                    in order to be even more clearly entitled to stay masters on our own terrain
                    regarding the Impressionists — so that there can be no doubt about our good
                    faith towards Reid — we could leave him alone and let him do as he thinks fit
                    regarding the Marseille Monticellis. Making the point that dead painters are
                    only of indirect interest to us from the monetary point of view. And if you
                    agree with this, if need be you can tell him on my behalf too that if he intends
                    to come to Marseille to buy Monticellis he has nothing to fear from us, but that
                    we’re entitled to ask him his intentions in this regard, given that we came to
                    this territory before he did. </p>
                <p>About the Impressionists — it would seem fair to me that they should be
                    introduced into England through you, if not by you in person. And if Reid made a
                    move first, we’d be justified in thinking he had acted in bad faith towards us,
                    all the more so since we’d have left him free regarding the Marseille
                    Monticellis. You would definitely be doing our friend Koning a favour if you let
                    him stay with you — his visit to Rivet must have proved to him that it wasn’t we
                    who advised him badly. If you did feel like taking him in — and it seems to me
                    that it would get him out of a mess, you’d just have to get things straight with
                    his father, so that you wouldn’t have any responsibilities, even indirect ones.
                    If you see Bernard tell him that so far I’m having to pay more than at
                    Pont-Aven, but that I think if you live here in furnished rooms with
                    middle-class people it must be possible to save money, which I’m trying to do,
                    and as soon as I’ve found out I’ll write and tell him what seem to me the
                    average expenses. </p>
                <p>At times it seems to me that my blood is more or less ready to start circulating
                    again, which wasn’t the case lately in Paris, I really couldn’t stand it any
                    more. I have to buy my colours and canvases from either a grocer or a
                    bookseller, who don’t have everything one might wish for. I’ll definitely have
                    to go to Marseille to see what the state of these things is like there. I had
                    hoped to find some beautiful blue &amp;c., and in fact I haven’t given up,
                    seeing that in Marseille you should be able to buy raw materials first hand. And
                    I’d like to be able to do blues like Ziem — which don’t change as much as the
                    others, well, we’ll see. Don’t worry, and give the pals a handshake for me.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo, </salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Thanks for your letter and the 100-franc note enclosed with it. I very much hope
                    that Tersteeg will come to Paris soon, as you’re inclined to believe. That would
                    be very desirable in the circumstances you describe, in which they are all at
                    bay and hard up. I find what you write about the Lançon sale and the painter’s
                    mistress very interesting. He’s done things of really great character, his
                    drawing has often made me think of Mauve’s. I’m sorry not to have seen the
                    exhibition of his studies, just as I’m really sorry not to have seen the
                    Willette exhibition either. What do you say to the news that Kaiser Wilhelm is
                    dead? Will that speed up events in France, and will Paris stay calm? It seems
                    doubtful. And what effect will all this have on the trade in paintings? I’ve
                    read that it seems there’s a possibility of abolishing import duty on paintings
                    in America, is that true? Perhaps it would be easier to get a few dealers and
                    art lovers to agree to buy Impressionist paintings than to get the artists to
                    agree to share equally the price of paintings sold. Nevertheless, artists won’t
                    find a better way than — to join together, give their pictures to the
                    association, and share the sale price in such a way that at least the society
                    will be able to guarantee the possibility of existence and work for its members.
                    If Degas, Claude Monet, Renoir, Sisley and C. Pissarro were to take the
                    initiative and say: here we are, each of the 5 of us gives 10 paintings (or
                    rather, we each give to the value of 10,000 francs, the value estimated by
                    expert members, for example, Tersteeg and yourself, appointed by the society,
                    and these experts also invest capital in the form of paintings), and,
                    furthermore, we commit ourselves to give to the value of... each year. And we
                    also invite you, Guillaumin, Seurat, Gauguin &amp;c. &amp;c. to join us (your
                    pictures being put to the same assessment from the point of view of value).</p>
                <p>Then the great Impressionists of the Grand Boulevard, giving paintings that
                    become common property, would retain their prestige, and the others wouldn’t be
                    able to criticize them for keeping to themselves the benefits of a reputation
                    gained without any doubt by their own efforts and by their individual genius in
                    the first place — but — nevertheless, in the second place, a reputation that is
                    growing and is now also being consolidated and supported by the paintings of a
                    whole battalion of artists who have so far been working while constantly broke.
                    Whatever happens — it’s really to be hoped that the thing comes off, and that
                    you and Tersteeg become the society’s expert members (with Portier
                    perhaps?).</p>
                <p>I<work origin="new" stage="middle"> have two more studies of landscapes</work>, I
                    hope the work will continue steadily and that in a month I’ll get a first
                    consignment to you — I say in a month because I want to send you nothing but the
                    best, and because I want it to be dry, and because I want to send at least a
                    dozen or so all at once because of the cost of transport. Congratulations on
                    buying the Seurat — with what I send you you’ll have to try to make an exchange
                    with Seurat as well.</p>
                <p>You’re well aware that if Tersteeg joins you in this venture, the two of you will
                    easily be able to persuade Boussod Valadon to extend substantial credit for the
                    purchases needed. But it’s urgent, because without that other dealers will cut
                    the ground from under your feet. I’ve made the acquaintance of a Danish artist
                    who talks about Heyerdahl and other people from the north, Krøyer, &amp;c. What
                    he does is dry but very conscientious, and he’s still young. Saw the exhibition
                    of the Impressionists in rue Laffitte at the time. He’ll probably come to Paris
                    for the Salon, and wants to tour Holland to see the museums. </p>
                <p>I think it’s a very good idea that you put the books in the Independents’ too.
                    This study should be given the title: ‘Parisian novels’. I’d be so happy to know
                    you’d succeeded in persuading Tersteeg — well, patience. I was obliged to buy
                    supplies for 50 francs when your letter arrived. This week I’ll start work on 4
                    or 5 things.</p>
                <p>I think about this association of artists every day, and the plan has developed
                    further in my mind, but Tersteeg would have to be involved, and a lot depends on
                    that. Nowadays, the artists would probably allow themselves to be persuaded by
                    us, but we can’t go ahead before we have Tersteeg’s help. Without that we’d be
                    on our own, listening to everybody moaning from morning till night, and each of
                    them individually would be constantly coming to ask for explanations — axioms —
                    &amp;c. Shouldn’t be surprised if Tersteeg took the view that we can’t do
                    without the Grand Boulevard artists — and if he advised you to persuade them to
                    take the initiative in an association by giving paintings that would become
                    common property and cease to belong to them individually. It seems to me that
                    the Petit Boulevard would be morally obliged to join in response to a proposal
                    from that side. And those Grand Boulevard gentlemen will only retain their
                    current prestige by forestalling the partly justified criticism of the minor
                    Impressionists, who’ll say: ‘you’re putting everything in your pocket’. They can
                    easily reply to that: not at all, on the contrary, we’re the first to say: our
                    paintings belong to the artists. If Degas, Monet, Renoir and Pissarro say that —
                    even leaving plenty of room for their individual ideas about putting it into
                    practice — they could — say worse, unless — they say nothing and let things
                    ride. </p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo, </salutation>
            <body>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="family">Your letter gave me great pleasure</unstress>, I thank
                    you for it as well as for the 50-franc note. I congratulate you heartily on
                    Tersteeg’s letter — I think it’s absolutely satisfactory.</p>
                <p>I’m convinced there’s nothing hurtful in his silence towards me, in any case he’d
                    have expected you to give me his reply to read. And it’s much more practical for
                    him having only to write to you, and as far as I’m concerned, if he doesn’t
                    think what I’m doing is utterly bad, you’ll see, he’ll write me a line as soon
                    as he’s seen my work. So once again, I’m happier with his simple and friendly
                    reply than I could tell you. You’ll have noticed that he states his willingness
                    to make a purchase of a good quality Monticelli for his own collection. If you
                    told him that we have a bouquet of flowers in our collection that is more
                    artistic and more beautiful than a bouquet by Diaz. That Monticelli would
                    sometimes take a bouquet of flowers in order to put on a single panel the whole
                    range of his richest and most perfectly balanced tones. And that you have to go
                    straight to Delacroix to find such an orchestration of colours. </p>
                <p>That — I’m referring to the painting at the Delarebeyrettes’ — we currently know
                    of another bouquet of very good quality and at a reasonable price, and that in
                    any case we think it’s much finer than the Monticellis with figures, which are
                    all over the place these days and belong to a period of decline in Monticelli’s
                    talent. I hope you’ll send him Gauguin’s fine seascape. But how pleased I am
                    that Tersteeg has replied in this way.</p>
                <p>When you write to him, say a word about Russell. When I write to Russell myself,
                    I’ll talk about his paintings and I’ll ask him to do an exchange with me,
                    because we’d want to mention him and show his paintings when it comes to the
                    question of the modern-day Renaissance school. I’ve just done a clump of apricot
                    trees in a little fresh green orchard. Had some trouble with the sunset with
                    figures and a bridge that I was talking to Bernard about. As the bad weather
                    prevented me from working on the spot, I completely worked this study to death
                    trying to finish it at home. </p>
                <p>However, I started the same subject again immediately afterwards on another
                    canvas, but as the weather was quite different, in a grey palette and without
                    figures. I wouldn’t think it a bad idea if you sent Tersteeg one of my studies —
                    do you mean the Clichy bridge with the yellow sky and two houses reflected in
                    the water?</p>

                <p>That one, or the butterflies or the field of poppies might do. However, I hope to
                    do better things here. If you happen to feel that way, you could tell Tersteeg
                    that I myself think I have a better chance of sales in Holland with the studies
                    of nature in the south, and that when Tersteeg comes to Paris in May he’ll find
                    a consignment with some subjects from down here. And again, many thanks for all
                    the initiatives you’ve taken for the Independents’ exhibition, all in all I’m
                    really pleased that they’ve put them with the other Impressionists. But —
                    although this time it makes no difference at all — in future my name must be put
                    in the catalogue the way I sign it on the canvases, i.e. Vincent and not
                    Vangogh, for the excellent reason that people here wouldn’t be able to pronounce
                    that name. </p>
                <p>I’m returning herewith the letter from Tersteeg and the one from Russell — it
                    will perhaps be interesting to keep the artists’ correspondence. If you included
                    the little head of a Breton woman by our friend Bernard in your consignment,
                    that wouldn’t be a bad idea. We must show him that all the Impressionists are
                    good and that what they do is very varied. I think our friend Reid regrets
                    falling out, unfortunately there can be no question of offering him the same
                    advantages again — that is, trying to let him have paintings on commission. It’s
                    not enough to love paintings, and it seemed to me that he lacked warm feelings
                    for painters. If he changes in that respect it won’t be overnight. Tersteeg was
                    a personal friend of Mauve and many others, and he has that je ne sais quoi that
                    wins art lovers over. You’ll see that what gives self-confidence is knowing
                    people. I’ll write more in the next few days, but wanted to congratulate you
                    right away on the renewal of your relations with Holland. Handshake.</p>

                    paintings must stay in living hands. If Tersteeg was willing — — —. If we do the
                    3 permanent exhibitions, we’d need a large Seurat for Paris, one for London and
                    one for Marseille. </p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo, </salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Thanks for your letter containing the samples of absorbent canvas. Will be very
                    glad to receive — but it’s not at all urgent — 3 metres of the sort at 6 francs.
                    As for his consignment of colours, there were only 4 large tubes of white in it,
                    while all the other tubes were half-size (of white). If he has charged for them
                    in the same proportions, that’s very good, but pay attention to that. 4 tubes of
                    white at 1 franc, but the rest should only be half the price. I find his
                    Prussian blue poor, and his cinnabar. The rest is good. Now I’ll tell you that
                        <work origin="new" stage="middle">I’m working on the 2 paintings</work> of
                    which I wanted to make repetitions. The pink peach tree is giving me the most
                    trouble.</p>





                <p>You can see from the four squares on the other side that the three orchards go
                    together, more or less. I now also have a small pear tree, vertical, also
                    flanked by two other horizontal canvases. That will make 6 canvases of orchards
                    in blossom. At the moment I’m trying to finish them a little every day, and to
                    make them go together. I dare hope for 3 more, also going together, but those
                    are still only in the state of embryos or foetuses.</p>
                <p>I’d really like to do this group of 9 canvases. You understand that we’re free to
                    consider the 9 canvases as the initial idea for a much larger, definitive
                    decoration (this one consists of no. 25 and no. 12 canvases), which would be
                    done after exactly the same subjects, at the same time next year. </p>

                <p>Here’s the other middle piece of the no. 12 canvases. The ground purple — in the
                    background a wall, with straight poplars — and a very blue sky. The small pear
                    tree has a purple trunk and white flowers, a large yellow butterfly on one of
                    the clumps. On the left, in the corner, a little garden with a border of yellow
                    reeds and green bushes and a flowerbed. A small pink house.</p>
                <p>So there are the details of the decoration of orchards in blossom, which I was
                    intending for you. But the last 3 canvases exist only in a provisional state,
                    and are supposed to represent a very large orchard with a border of cypresses
                    and large pear trees and apple trees. The ‘Pont de Langlois’ for you is going
                    well, and will be better than the study, I think. Am in a real hurry to get back
                    to work. As for the Guillaumin, if it’s possible, it’s certainly a good deal to
                    buy it. But since they’re talking about a new method for fixing pastel, would
                    perhaps be wise to ask him to fix it in this way, in case of purchase. Handshake
                    to you and to Koning.</p>
            </body>

            <ps>
                <p>I’ve had a letter from Bernard with some sonnets that he’s made, some of which
                    are successful; he’ll succeed in making a good sonnet, for which I almost envy
                    him. As soon as the Langlois bridge and the repetition of the other painting
                    (the pink peach tree) are dry, will make a consignment.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>I’ll start by telling you that the letter you didn’t receive was wrongly
                    addressed by me and as such came back to me. I had — in a moment of distraction
                    — a classic case — addressed it rue de Laval instead of rue Lepic. That being so
                    I’m repeating for you what was in the letter — what was new — the visit by
                    Macknight, Russell’s friend, who came back last Sunday by the way. I must go to
                    see him at home and see what he’s making, of which I’ve seen nothing so far.
                    He’s a Yankee who probably does much better than the ordinary run of Yankees.
                    But a Yankee all the same.</p>
                <p>Is that saying enough? When I’ve seen his paintings or drawings I’ll concede
                    about the work. But about the man, still the same. The main point of this letter
                    is to know if you’ve left, and how. And after — that — what comes after — you
                    perhaps don’t know yourself. Anyway, it always seems that those Boussod Val.
                    gentlemen don’t care in the least for what the artists themselves will say about
                    it.</p>
                <p>But I won’t hide from you that <stress reason="career">I thought the news was bad
                        and that</stress>, I assure you, I’ve thought about it every day, quite in
                    spite of myself. Because I daren’t continue with things that are going to cost
                    you more than they’ll bring in at present. Because it’s something of a sign, all
                    this conversation with those B&amp;V gentlemen, that Impressionism isn’t
                    catching on sufficiently. As for me, I immediately stopped doing paintings and
                    I’ve carried on with<work stage="finished" origin="new"> a series of pen
                        drawings of which you’ve had the first two</work>, but in a smaller format.
                    Because I said to myself that a falling-out with those gentlemen could make
                    lower expenses on my part desirable for you.Not being so very attached to my
                    paintings I’d leave them there without grumbling too much. </p>
                <p>Not being, fortunately for me, one of those people whose only love in this world
                    is paintings. On the contrary, believing that an artistic thing can be made at
                    less cost than a painting requires — I’ve started a series of pen drawings.
                    While waiting, I have some annoyances. I don’t now think that I’ll benefit from
                    staying where I am, I’d rather take a room or two rooms, if need be, one to
                    sleep in, one to work in. Because the people here, in order to make me pay
                    pretty high rates for EVERYTHING, make too much of the fact that I take up a
                    little more room with my paintings than their other customers who aren’t
                    painters. For my part, I’ll make the point that I’m staying longer and spend
                    more in the guest-house than labourers who just stay a short time. And they
                    won’t get a sou out of me so easily any more. But — it’s always a really
                    miserable thing dragging your equipment and paintings along behind you, and that
                    makes coming in and going out more difficult. </p>
                <p>Being forced, determined anyway, to move, do you want or rather do you think it
                    more suitable, to go to Marseille now? I can do a series of seascapes there like
                    the orchards in blossom series here. And I’ve also bought 3 strong cloth shirts
                    and two pairs of sturdy shoes, with the idea of moving. In Marseille I would be
                    more willing to try to obtain a showcase for the Impressionists, if you for your
                    part would give me an assurance that you’d supply it, this showcase, with
                    Impressionist paintings if people ask you to exhibit them. Which will be easy. I
                    sometimes have serious anxieties that you, and I too, will be rooked again by
                    those Boussod Valadon &amp; Cie gentlemen, who give us a hard time. But I resist
                    it. Don’t let yourself be rooked by them. Enough for today. So let me know your
                    address in case you travel. When will you be in Holland? Still same address for
                    me but would like to move, as I don’t feel comfortable here. Will send you pen
                    drawings shortly, I already have 4 of them.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo, </salutation>
            <body>
                <p>I’m writing you another line to tell you that on reflection I think the best
                    thing will be quite simply to take a mat and a mattress and make a bed in the
                    studio on the floor. Because for the whole summer it’s going to be so hot it’ll
                    be more than enough like that. Then in the winter we could see if we’ll need to
                    take a bed, yes or no. About the bed you have at home, I think the arrangement
                    of having a painter living with you is good for the painter and for you too,
                    from the point of view of conversation and company. So even if Koning were to
                    leave, there would perhaps be someone else who could replace him. So why don’t
                    you keep the bed at home in any case? </p>
                <p>It’s quite possible that as far as houses go I’ll find an even better one, either
                    at Martigues, beside the sea, or in some other place. But the delightful thing
                    about this studio is the gardens opposite. But there you are, as for doing
                    repairs or furnishing it reasonably well, let’s wait — that will be wiser — all
                    the more so since if we had to have cholera here in the summer, it could be that
                    I’d up sticks and go to the country. <stress reason="environment"> It’s dirty,
                        this town, with its old streets! </stress>As for the Arlésiennes they talk
                    about so much, don’t they, do you know what I think of them, in short?
                    Certainly, they’re truly charming, but it’s not what it must have been once. And
                    there you are, it’s often more Mignard than Mantegna, since they’re in decline,
                    but be that as it may, it’s beautiful, really beautiful, and here I’m only
                    talking about the Roman type — a bit boring and ordinary. But what exceptions!
                    There are women like Fragonards and — like Renoir. And something you can’t fit
                    into what’s already been done in painting! The best thing one could do, from all
                    points of view, would be to paint portraits of women and children. But it seems
                    to me that it won’t be I who does that, I don’t feel I’m enough of a Mr Bel-ami
                    for that. But I’d be mightily pleased if that Bel-ami of the south — which
                    Monticelli – wasn’t — but was preparing the ground — which I can feel in the air
                    while at the same time feeling that it isn’t me — I’d be, I tell you — mightily
                    pleased if in painting a man like Guy de Maupassant came along and cheerfully
                    painted the beautiful people and things in these parts. </p>
                <p>As for me, I’ll work, and here and there some of my work will last — but what
                    Claude Monet is in landscape, the same thing in figure painting — who’s going to
                    do that? Yet like me you must feel it’s in the air. Rodin? Rodin doesn’t do
                    colour — it’s not him. But the painter of the future is a colourist such as
                    there hasn’t been before. Manet prepared the ground, but you’re well aware that
                    the Impressionists have already used stronger colour than Manet’s. This painter
                    of the future, I can’t imagine him living in small restaurants, working with
                    several false teeth and going into Zouave brothels like me. But it seems to me
                    that I’m in the right when I feel it will come in a later generation and that in
                    our case we have to do what our means allow us in that direction, without having
                    doubts and without flinching. </p>
                <p>Please let Guillaumin know that Russell wants to go and see him at home and
                    intends to buy another painting from him. I’m writing to Russell today. I was
                    hearing yesterday from Macknight and from the Dane that in Marseille there was
                    never anything good in the dealers’ windows, and that they thought that nothing
                    at all was being done there. I’m very keen to see something of that for myself,
                    but for the very reason that I don’t want to get all worked up I’ll do it when
                    my nerves are settled. In the letter I addressed wrongly, I was actually talking
                    about Bonger. He probably dares say as much, since the Russians are having such
                    success at the Theâtre Libre, &amp;c. But that’s no reason, is it, to try to use
                    that success to run the French down? </p>
                <p>I’ve just read Zola’s Au bonheur des dames again and I find it more and more
                    beautiful. Now that’s news, that Reid’s back. I told Russell that since it was I
                    who had introduced him into his home it was partly up to me to tell him why we’d
                    fallen out. That Reid was ambitious, and being hard up for money like all of us,
                    he was beside himself when it came to earning money. That I saw all that as
                    involuntary acts (and him not responsible, therefore, and to be forgiven for
                    these acts) of an over-excited nervous system. But that with Reid the vulgar
                    dealer is stronger than the distinguished artist. </p>

                <p>That won’t suit Reid, but is it too much to tell the truth? It’s surely no better
                    than that now, and worse, in fact. <stress reason="friendship">Russell’s friend,
                        Macknight, is a cold and not very nice character, too bad if I have both of
                        them against me</stress>.</p>
                <p>However, I’ve said nothing about Macknight, although I imagine he has no more
                    heart than Reid. If he found his painting style that would do him good, and it’s
                    not impossible that it will come — he’s still young. 27, I think. Let’s assume
                    then, if you think it’s right, that we won’t be in a hurry yet to put the studio
                    in order. It’s already good enough for the time being. <unstress reason="money"
                        >And if I sleep there the way I’ve said above it won’t cost me anything. I
                        save 30 francs at the hotel and pay 15 in rent, so there’s nothing but
                        benefit in that.</unstress> Handshake to you and to Koning. I have another
                    drawing.</p>

                    back to take measurements. Was the Degroux you speak of the same subject as the
                    one in the museum in Brussels, the Saying grace? True what you say about De
                    Braekeleer. Have you heard that he was suffering from a brain disease that’s
                    supposed to have reduced him to helplessness??? I’ve heard that, but wasn’t it
                    temporary? You mention the name of someone else, whom I don’t know.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>For the time being I have to pay my bill, but at the same time it’s stated on the
                    receipt that this payment is only to recover possession of my things, and that
                    the inflated bill will be submitted to the justice of the peace. But with all
                    that I have practically nothing left, I bought what I need to make a little
                    coffee or broth at home, and two chairs and a table. <stress reason="money">That
                        means I have just 15 francs left. So I’m asking you to send me some more
                        money no later than when you get back to Paris, in any case. It’s very
                        annoying, as this business is seriously interfering with my work — and the
                        weather’s beautiful just now.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="career">I regret not having taken this studio sooner. With what
                        those people overcharged me I could already have furnished it. But I really
                        count on it I’ve now paid my dues to misfortune and it’s better that should
                        come at the beginning than at the end of the expedition.</stress> I feel
                    sure I’ll soon have several new canvases on the easel. My consignment is packed
                    up and will go off today. But it’s discouraging to work hard and see your profit
                    going into the hands of people you detest. </p>

                <p>And we’ll put an end to that. I’ll make a studio here that will last, and where
                    if need be we can fit another painter in. Foreigners are exploited here and —
                    for their part, the people around here aren’t wrong — it’s considered a duty to
                    get all you can out of them. Right out in the country like Macknight you pay
                    less, but Macknight is very bored and is working very little so far. And it’s
                    better to work hard and spend more, if it’s absolutely necessary.</p>
                <p>If you put aside what’s best in the consignment — and if you were to think of
                    these paintings as a payment on my part to be deducted from what I owe you —
                    Then the day when, from my side, I would have contributed something like 10
                    thousand francs in this way, I would feel more at ease. The money already spent
                    in other years should also come back into our hands, in value at least. I’m
                    still far from that. But I feel that nature here has everything you need to make
                    good things. So it would be my fault if I didn’t succeed. In a single year Mauve
                    made and sold watercolours for 6,000 francs, according to what he told me at the
                    time. Ah well, there are strokes of luck of that kind for which I can sense a
                    possibility, even through my present worries. In this consignment there are the
                    pink orchard on coarse canvas and the horizontal white orchard and the bridge,
                    which, if we keep them, I think could go up in value later, and about fifty
                    paintings of that quality would compensate us in a way for the fact that we’ve
                    had too little luck in the past. So take these three for your collection at home
                    and don’t sell them because later on they’ll be worth 500 each. And if we had 50
                    like that put aside, then I’d breathe a bit more easily. Anyway — write to me
                    soon.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>I’m writing you another few lines to tell you that I’ve been to see the gentleman
                    whom the Arab Jew in Tartarin calls ‘the shustish of the beace’. I still got 12
                    francs back and my host was reprimanded for keeping my trunk; as I wasn’t
                    refusing to pay, he had no right to hold it. If they’d found in favour of the
                    other party, that would have done me harm, because he wouldn’t have failed to go
                    around saying that I had not been able or not been willing to pay him, and that
                    he’d been forced to take my trunk. Whereas now — because I left at the same time
                    as him — he said as we went that he’d been angry but hadn’t really wished to
                    insult me. But that’s just what he was trying to do, probably seeing that I had
                    seen enough of his shack — and that he couldn’t make me stay — he’d have gone to
                    tell tales where I am at the moment. All right. If I’d wanted to get the actual
                    reduction, I’d probably have claimed more in damages, for example. If I let
                    myself be annoyed by just anybody I’d soon not know where to turn, you
                    understand. </p>
                <p>I’ve found a better restaurant where I eat for 1 franc. <good_health>My health’s
                        been better these days. </good_health>Now I have <work origin="existing"
                        stage="finished">two new studies like this</work>:</p>



                <p>You already have a drawing of it, a farmhouse beside the wide road in the
                    wheatfields. </p>


                <p>A meadow full of very yellow buttercups, a ditch with iris plants with green
                    leaves, with purple flowers, the town in the background, some grey willow trees
                    — a strip of blue sky. </p>
                <p> If they don’t mow the meadow I’d like to do this study again, because the
                    subject matter was really beautiful and I had trouble finding the composition. A
                    little town surrounded by countryside entirely covered in yellow and purple
                    flowers. That would really be a Japanese dream, you know. Having asked the price
                    for sending the consignment that went off by goods train, it will be 7 francs at
                    the station in Paris. As I don’t have very much left I didn’t put postage on it
                    here — but if they asked more you’d have to complain. The crate is marked UV and
                    W1042. We’ve had the mistral again yesterday and today. I hope my consignment
                    arrives before Tersteeg comes to Paris. Handshake, write to me soon.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo, </salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Thanks for your letter containing 100 francs. I’m very glad to have left those
                    people’s place, <good_health>and my health is much better since</good_health>.
                    It was their bad food more than anything that made it drag on, and their wine,
                    which was real poison. I now eat very well for one franc or 1.50 francs.
                    Tasset’s absorbent canvas would be just the thing for me if the canvas itself
                    was three times as coarse. If you run into that gentleman see if you can find
                    out what he uses as primer. It wouldn’t surprise me if his canvas is prepared
                    with pipeclay. If I had information about it I think I’d prepare the canvas
                    myself. It’s not urgent — but see what you can find out. I still have 4 metres
                    of canvas 1 metre 20 wide that I bought here, but it isn’t prepared yet. As soon
                    as there’d be another consignment of colours, he could add primer to that
                    consignment, enough to prepare 4 metres. But anyway, it’s not urgent yet. </p>
                <p>On your return did those gentlemen speak again about making you travel? In the
                    next few days you’ll see the Danish painter who was here arrive in Paris, I
                    don’t know how to write his name (Moriés?). He’s going to see the Salon and will
                    then go back to his country and come back to the south, in a year perhaps. His
                    last three studies were better and more colourful than what he was doing before.
                    I don’t know what he’ll do later. But he has a good character and I’m sorry he’s
                    going away. I told him a Dutch painter was living with you, and if Koning would
                    like to take him up the Butte Montmartre he’ll probably do some studies there.
                    I’ve talked to him a lot about the Impressionists, all of whom he knew by name
                    or from having seen their paintings, and he’s very interested in the subject. He
                    has a letter of introduction to Russell. He regained his health here and is now
                    very well — he’s good for two years — but after that it would do him good to
                    come back for this same reason of health. What’s this new book on Daumier,
                    L’homme et l’oeuvre? Have you seen the exhibition of the caricaturists? </p>
                <p>
                    <work origin="new" stage="finished">I have two new studies, a bridge and the
                        verge of a wide road.</work> Many of the subjects here are just — in
                    character — the same as in Holland — the difference is in the colour. There’s
                    sulphur everywhere where the sun beats down. You know that we saw a magnificent
                    rose garden by Renoir. I imagined I would find similar subjects here, and that
                    was indeed the case when the orchards were in blossom. Now the appearance of
                    things has changed and nature has become much harsher. But what greenness and
                    what a blue! I must say that the few landscapes by Cézanne that I know render it
                    very, very well, and I regret not having seen more of them. The other day I saw
                    a subject just like Monticelli’s beautiful landscape with the poplars that we
                    saw at Reid’s. To find more of Renoir’s gardens you’d probably have to go
                    towards Nice. I’ve seen very few roses here, although there are some, among
                    others the big red roses they call Roses de Provence. </p>
                <p>To find plenty of subjects is perhaps already something in itself. Provided the
                    paintings are worth what they cost. If the Impressionists go up in value that
                    may become the case. And after a few years’ work we could recoup the past to
                    some extent. And after a year I’ll have a quiet home of my own. I’m curious
                    about what you’ll say about my consignment, I think it takes 10 days to go from
                    here to Paris by goods train. If the consignment includes some that are too
                    poor, don’t show them. The reason I sent you the whole lot is that it will give
                    you an idea of the things I’ve seen. I need to go and look for a new subject, so
                    thanking you very warmly for writing to me so soon, handshake to you and to
                    Koning.</p>

                    you considered that your lethargy — a feeling of extreme lassitude — could have
                    been caused by this heart condition, and that in that case potassium iodide
                    couldn’t be blamed for these periods of stupefied exhaustion? If you remember
                    how <bad_health>stupefied I was myself this winter, to the point of being quite
                        incapable</bad_health>! of doing anything whatsoever, apart from a little
                    painting, although I wasn’t taking potassium iodide at all. So if I were you,
                    I’d have it out with Rivet if Gruby tells you not to take it. And it will in any
                    case — I have no doubt about it — be your intention to be friends with both the
                    one and the other. I often think of Gruby here and now, and in short I feel
                    well, but it’s because here I have the pure air and the heat, which make things
                    more possible for me. Among all the trials and the bad air of Paris, Rivet takes
                    things as they are without trying to create a paradise and without in the
                    slightest way trying to make us perfect. But he forges a suit of armour, or
                    rather, he inures us to illness and keeps morale up, I find, by making fun of
                    the trouble we have. </p>
                <p>So if you could now have just one year of living in the country and close to
                    nature, that would make Gruby’s treatment much easier. So I think he’ll urge you
                    not to see women except in case of necessity, but as little as possible. Now for
                    myself, I feel fine here in that respect, but here, since I have work and
                    nature, and if I didn’t have that I’d become melancholy. As long as work has
                    some appeal for you over there, and the Impressionists are going well, that
                    would be a great gain. Because loneliness, worries, vexations, the need for
                    friendship and fellow-feeling not sufficiently met, that’s what’s very bad, the
                    mental emotions of sadness or disappointments undermine us more than riotous
                    living: us, that is, who find ourselves the happy owners of troubled hearts. I
                    think potassium iodide purifies the blood and the whole system, doesn’t it —
                    will you be able to do without it? Anyway, you’ll have to have a straight talk
                    about it with Rivet, who shouldn’t be jealous. I could wish you had near you
                    something more rudely alive, warmer than the Dutch — but all the same, Koning
                    with his whims is an exception for the better. Anyway, it’s always good to have
                    somebody. But I could still wish you had one or two good friends among the
                    French. Would you do me a great favour: my friend the Dane, who leaves for Paris
                    on Tuesday, will give you 2 small paintings — nothing much — that I’d like to
                    give to Mme the Countess De la Boissière at Asnières. She stays in boulevard
                    Voltaire, on the first floor of the first house at the end of the Clichy bridge.
                    Père Perruchot’s restaurant is on the ground floor. Would you take them to her
                    personally on my behalf, saying I had hopes of seeing her again this spring and
                    that even here I haven’t forgotten her; I gave them 2 small ones last year as
                    well, her and her daughter. I’d have hope that you wouldn’t regret making these
                    ladies’ acquaintance. After all, they’re a family. The countess is far from
                    young but she’s first of all a countess, then a lady, the daughter ditto. </p>
                <p>And it makes sense for you to go, since I can’t be sure that the family’s staying
                    in the same place this year (however, they’ve been coming there for several
                    years, and Perruchot must know their address in town). Perhaps I’m deluding
                    myself — but I can’t help thinking of them, and perhaps it will be a pleasure
                    for them and for you too, if you meet them. Listen — I’ll do all I can to send
                    you some new drawings for Dordrecht. This week <work origin="new"
                        stage="finished">I’ve done two still lifes</work>.</p>



                <p>A blue enamelled tin coffee-pot, a royal blue and gold cup (on the left), a pale
                    blue and white chequered milk jug, a cup — on the right — white, with blue and
                    orange designs, on a yellow grey earthenware plate, a blue barbotine or majolica
                    jug with red, green, brown designs, and lastly 2 oranges and 3 lemons; the table
                    is covered with a blue cloth, the background is yellow green, making 6 different
                    blues and 4 or 5 yellows and oranges. The other still life is the majolica jug
                    with wild flowers. </p>

                <p>I thank you very much for your letter and for the 50-franc note. I hope the crate
                    will reach you in the next few days. The next time I think I’ll take the
                    canvases off the stretching frames and send them rolled, by fast service. I
                    think you’ll soon make friends with this Dane — he doesn’t do much but — he has
                    intelligence and a good heart, and he probably started painting not long ago.
                    Take him out a bit one Sunday to get to know him. For myself, I feel infinitely
                    better, my blood is circulating well, and my stomach’s digesting. I’ve found
                    very, very good food now, which had an immediate effect on me. Have you seen
                    Gruby’s face when he pinches his lips tight and says ‘No women’? It would make a
                    really good Degas, that face, like that. But there’s nothing to be said against
                    it, because when you have to work all day long with your brain, calculating,
                    thinking, planning business, that’s quite enough in itself for your nerves. So
                    go off now and visit women in the world of artists and suchlike, you’ll see
                    you’ll succeed — really. You’ll see it’ll work out like that and you won’t lose
                    much, will you? I still haven’t been able to make a deal with the furniture
                    dealer, I’ve seen a bed but it’s dearer than I thought. I feel the need to get
                    more work done before spending more on furniture. My lodgings cost me 1 franc a
                    night. I’ve bought more linen and colours as well. </p>

                <p>I’ve bought some very strong linen. Just as my blood is returning to normal, so
                    the idea of succeeding is returning to me too. I shouldn’t be too surprised if
                    your illness was also a reaction to this dreadful winter, which lasted an age.
                    And then it will go the same way as with me; take as much spring air as
                    possible, go to bed very early because you’ll need to sleep; and then food, lots
                    of fresh vegetables and no bad wine or bad liquor. And very few women and a
                    great deal of patience. If it doesn’t clear up at once that doesn’t matter. And
                    now Gruby will give you a heavy meat diet over there. Here, for myself, I
                    couldn’t take very much, and it’s not necessary here. It’s just my stupefaction
                    that’s going away, I don’t feel as much need to amuse myself, I’m less at the
                    mercy of my passions and I can work more calmly, I could be alone without being
                    bored. I came out of it feeling a little older, but no sadder. I wouldn’t
                    believe you if in your next letter you told me there was nothing wrong with you
                    any more; it’s perhaps a more serious change and I shouldn’t be surprised if,
                    during the time it will take you to recover, you had some dejection. There is
                    and there remains and it always comes back at times, in the midst of the
                    artistic life, a yearning for — real life — ideal and not attainable. </p>
                <p>And we sometimes lack the desire to throw ourselves head first into art again and
                    to build ourselves up for that. We know we’re cab-horses and that it’ll be the
                    same cab we’re going to be harnessed to again. And so we don’t feel like doing
                    it and we’d prefer to live in a meadow with a sun, a river, the company of other
                    horses who are also free, and the act of generation. And perhaps in the final
                    account your heart condition comes partly from there; it wouldn’t greatly
                    surprise me. We no longer rebel against things, we’re not resigned either —
                    we’re ill and it’s not going to get any better — and we can’t do anything
                    specific about it. I don’t know who called this condition being struck by death
                    and immortality. The cab we drag along must be of use to people we don’t know.
                    But you see, if we believe in the new art, in the artists of the future, our
                    presentiment doesn’t deceive us. When good père Corot said a few days before he
                    died: last night I saw in my dreams landscapes with entirely pink skies, well,
                    didn’t they come, those pink skies, and yellow and green into the bargain, in
                    Impressionist landscapes? All this is to say there are things one senses in the
                    future and that really come about. .</p>
                <p>And we, who, I’m inclined to believe, are by no means so close to dying,
                    nevertheless feel the thing is bigger than us and longer-lasting than our lives.
                    We don’t feel we’re dying, but we feel the reality of the fact that we’re not
                    much, and that to be a link in the chain of artists we pay a steep price in
                    health, youth, freedom, which we don’t enjoy at all, any more than the cab-horse
                    that pulls a carriage full of people who, unlike him, are going out to enjoy the
                    springtime. Well then — what I wish you as well as myself is to succeed in
                    recovering our health, because we’ll need it. That Hope of Puvis de Chavannes is
                    such a reality. There’s an art in the future and it will surely be so beautiful
                    and so young that, really, if at present we leave it our own youth, we can only
                    gain in tranquillity. Perhaps it’s too silly to write all this, but it’s what I
                    felt; it seemed that like me, you suffered to see your youth going up in — smoke
                    — but if it comes back and appears in what we do, there’s nothing lost, and the
                    power to work is a second youth. So be serious about getting better, because
                    we’ll need our health. I shake your hand firmly, and Koning’s too. </p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>I read an announcement in L’Intransigeant that there’s going to be an exhibition
                    of the Impressionists at Durand-Ruel — there’ll be some works by Caillebotte
                    —I’ve never seen anything of his, and wanted to ask you to write and tell me
                    what they’re like — there are certainly other noteworthy things too. I sent you
                        <work mention="vague">some more drawings today, and I’m adding two
                        more</work>. They’re views taken from a rocky hill from which you can see in
                    the direction of the Crau (an area from which a very good wine comes), the town
                    of Arles and in the direction of Fontvieille. The contrast between the wild and
                    romantic foreground — and the broad, tranquil distant prospects with their
                    horizontal lines, shading off until they reach the chain of the Alpilles — so
                    famous for the great feats of climbing of Tartarin, P.C.A., and the Alpine Club.
                        <unstress reason="environment">This contrast is very picturesque</unstress>.
                    The two drawings that I’m now adding afterwards will give you an idea of the
                    ruin that crowns the rocks. But is it worth the trouble of making frames for
                    this Dordrecht exhibition? I find it so silly and I’d prefer not to be part of
                    it. I prefer to believe that Bernard or Gauguin will exchange drawings with us
                    in which the Dutch will see nothing. Have you met the Dane Mourier-Petersen —
                    he’ll have brought you another two drawings as well. </p>

                <p>He studied to be a doctor, but I suppose he was discouraged in that by the
                    student life, discouraged by both his pals and his professors. He never said
                    anything to me about it, though, except that he once declared: ‘but doctors kill
                    people’. When he came here he was suffering from a nervous condition that came
                    from the strain of the examinations. How long has he been doing painting — I
                    don’t know — he’s certainly made little progress as a painter, but he’s good as
                    a pal and he looks at people and often judges them very accurately. Could there
                    be a possible arrangement whereby he could come to live with you? As far as
                    intelligence goes, I think he’d be far more preferable to that Lacoste, of whom
                    I don’t think highly, I don’t know why. You’ve absolutely no need of 6th-rate
                    Dutchmen or worse, who when going back to their country do nothing but say and
                    do idiotic things. A dealer in paintings is, unfortunately, more or less a
                    public figure. Anyway, there’s no serious harm done. The Swede is from a good
                    family, he has order and regularity in his means of support, and as a man he
                    makes me think of those characters Pierre Loti creates. For all that he’s
                    phlegmatic, he has a good heart. </p>
                <p>I plan to do a lot more drawing. It’s already jolly hot, I can assure you. I must
                    add an order for colours to this letter — however, if you’d prefer not to get
                    them immediately I’d do a few more drawings and wouldn’t lose anything by it.
                    I’ll also divide the order into two according to what would be more urgent or
                    less. What’s always urgent is to draw, and whether it’s done directly with a
                    brush, or with something else, such as a pen, you never do enough. I’m trying
                    now to exaggerate the essence of things, and to deliberately leave vague what’s
                    commonplace.</p>
                <p>I’m delighted that you’ve bought the book on Daumier — but if you could add to
                    that by buying some more of his lithographs that would be absolutely good —
                    because in the future Daumiers won’t be easy to get hold of. How’s your health,
                    have you seen père Gruby again? I’m inclined to believe he exaggerates your
                    heart condition a bit, to the detriment of the need to treat you rigorously for
                    your nervous system. Well, he’ll certainly realize it as you follow his
                    treatment; with Gruby you’ll last, but unfortunately for us père Gruby himself
                    won’t last, because he’s getting old and when we need him the most he won’t be
                    there any more. I’m thinking more and more that we shouldn’t judge the Good Lord
                    by this world, because it’s one of his studies that turned out badly. But what
                    of it, in failed studies — when you’re really fond of the artist — you don’t
                    find much to criticize — you keep quiet. But we’re within our rights to ask for
                    something better. We’d have to see other works by the same hand though. This
                    world was clearly cobbled together in haste, in one of those bad moments when
                    its author no longer knew what he was doing, and didn’t have his wits about him.
                    What legend tells us about the Good Lord is that he went to enormous trouble
                    over this study of his for a world. I’m inclined to believe that the legend
                    tells the truth, but then the study is worked to death in several ways. It’s
                    only the great masters who make such mistakes; that’s perhaps the best
                    consolation, as we’re then within our rights to hope to see revenge taken by the
                    same creative hand. And — then — this life — criticized so much and for such
                    good, even excellent reasons — we — shouldn’t take it for anything other than it
                    is, and we’ll be left with the hope of seeing better than that in another life.
                    Handshake to you and to Koning. </p>

                    surprise me that it takes time, though, as the crate had to be transported from

            <salutation>My dear Theo, </salutation>
            <body>
                <p>I thought of Gauguin and here we are — if Gauguin wants to come here there’s
                    Gauguin’s fare, and then there are the two beds or the two mattresses we
                    absolutely have to buy. But later on, as Gauguin’s a sailor, there’s a
                    likelihood we’ll manage to make our grub at home. And the two of us will live on
                    the same money as I spend on myself alone.</p>
                <p>You know I’ve always thought it ridiculous for painters to live alone &amp;c.
                        <stress reason="friendship">You always lose when you’re isolated</stress>.
                    Well, it’s in response to your wish to help him out. You can’t send him what he
                    needs to live on in Brittany, and me what I need to live on in Provence. But you
                    may agree that we should share, and set a sum of, let’s say, 250 a month if
                    every month, in addition to and apart from my work, you were to have a
                    Gauguin.</p>
                <p>As long as we didn’t exceed that amount, wouldn’t there even be a benefit?
                    Besides, I’m speculating about joining forces with others. So herewith rough
                    draft of a letter to Gauguin, which I’ll write if you approve, with the changes
                    that will doubtless have to be made to turns of phrase. But I wrote that way
                    first. Think of it as a simple business arrangement, that’s best for everyone,
                    and let’s treat it straightforwardly that way. Only, given that you’re not in
                    business on your own account, you may, for example, think it right that I take
                    it upon myself, and Gauguin would join forces with me as a pal.</p>
                <p>I thought that you had a wish to come to his aid, as I suffer myself at the
                    thought that he’s in a tight corner — something that won’t change overnight. We
                    can’t offer better than that, and others wouldn’t do as much. For my part,
                        <stress reason="friendship">it worries me to spend so much on myself
                        alone</stress>, but to find a remedy for that there’s none other than that
                    of finding a wife with money or pals who associate with one another for
                    paintings. Now I don’t see the wife, but I do see the pals. If that suited him,
                    wouldn’t do to keep him waiting.</p>
                <p>This would be the beginnings of an association, then. Bernard, who’s coming to
                    the south too, will join us, and be sure of this, I still see you in France, at
                    the head of an association of Impressionists. And if I could be useful in
                    putting them together, I’d willingly see them abler than myself. You must feel
                    how much it vexes me to spend more than they do; I have to find a partnership
                    that’s more advantageous, both to you and to them. And that’s how it would be.
                    However, think it over carefully, but isn’t it true that in good company you
                    could live on little as long as you spent your money at home? Later on there may
                    be days when we’ll be less hard up, but I’m not counting on it. It would please
                    me so much if you had the Gauguins first. I’m not good at cooking &amp;c., but
                    they’ve had different training in that, having done their service &amp;c.
                    Handshake and best wishes to Koning, after all, it’s a source of satisfaction
                    for you to deliver him in good condition, which might not have been the case if
                    you hadn’t taken him with you. It’s also satisfactory that the Goupils have been
                    interested in taking that room you suggested. </p>

                <p>Has Tersteeg come to Paris yet? In order to prepare things, and to expand on this
                    letter, I’m writing to Gauguin, but without saying anything about all this, just
                    to talk about work. You have to think it over very, very, very carefully before
                    starting to travel. It seems so likely to me that your job is to stay in
                    France.</p>

                <p>Appendix: draft letter to Paul Gauguin </p>


                <p>My dear old Gauguin,</p>
                <p>I’ve thought of you very often and if I’m only writing now it’s because I didn’t
                    want to write empty phrases. The deal with Russell hasn’t come off yet, but
                    Russell has bought some Impressionists all the same, Guillaumin and Bernard and
                    — wait for your moment — he’ll come of his own accord, but I couldn’t press the
                    point further, having had two refusals, but always with a promise for the
                    future. Wanted to write now to tell you I’ve just rented a four-room house here
                    in Arles. And that it seems to me that if I find another painter who feels like
                    getting the most out of the south, and who like me was sufficiently absorbed in
                    his work to be able to resign himself to living like a monk who’d go to the
                    brothel once a fortnight — apart from that, bound up in his work and not
                    inclined to waste his time — then the thing would be good. On my own, I suffer a
                    bit from this isolation. </p>
                <p>So I’ve very often thought about talking to you about it straight out. You know
                    that my brother and I have a high regard for your painting and that we’d very
                    much wish to know you were a little at your ease. But all the same, my brother
                    can’t send money to you in Brittany and at the same time money to me in
                    Provence. But would you like to share with me here? Then by joining forces,
                    there would perhaps be enough for two; I’m sure of it, even. Having once
                    attacked the south, I see no reason to give it up. I was ill when I came, I’m
                    better now and in fact, I feel rather attracted to the south, where outdoor work
                    is possible almost all the year round. </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="money">Living here seems more expensive</stress>, though, but
                    isn’t it also the case that the opportunities for gaining paintings are greater?
                    In any event, if my brother were to send us 250 francs a month for both of us,
                    would you like to come, and we would share. But in that case we’d have to make
                    up our minds to eat at home as much as possible; we’d take on some kind of
                    charwoman for a few hours a day, avoiding all the costs of a hotel that way. And
                    you would give my brother one painting a month, while you’d be free to do
                    whatever you liked with the rest. Now the two of us would start exhibiting in
                    Marseille straightaway, thus opening the way for other Impressionists as well as
                    for ourselves. <stress reason="money">We mustn’t forget that there would now be
                        the cost of travel and of buying a bed, which would also have to be paid for
                        with paintings.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>You are, of course, free to correspond with my brother about this matter, but I
                    warn you that he’ll most probably refuse to take responsibility for it. He’ll
                    just assure you that the only means we’ve found up to now of helping you in a
                    more practical way would be this arrangement, if it suits you. We’ve thought
                    about it a good deal. It seems to me that what you need for your health’s sake
                    is peace and quiet above all. If I’m wrong, and if the heat in the south turned
                    out to be too much — well — we’d have to see. For myself, so far I feel very
                    well in this climate. There’s plenty more I could tell you — but here we are,
                    business first. Reply to both of us soon. </p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo, </salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Many thanks for your kind letter and the 50-franc note that was enclosed with it.
                    We’ll still have to write to Gauguin. The problem is this bloody journey, since
                    we urge him to make it, and afterwards we’d be in an awkward position if it
                    doesn’t suit him. I think I’ll write to him today and will send you the letter.
                    Now that I’ve seen the sea here I really feel the importance there is in staying
                    in the south and feeling — if the colour has to be even more exaggerated —
                    Africa not far away from one. I’m sending you<work origin="existing"
                        stage="middle"> by same post some drawings of Saintes-Maries</work>. I did
                    the drawing of the boats as I was leaving, very early in the morning, and I’m
                    working on the painting, a no. 30 canvas with more sea and sky on the right. It
                    was before the boats cleared off; I’d watched it all the other mornings, but as
                    they leave very early, hadn’t had time to do it. I have another 3 drawings of
                    huts that I still need and which will follow; these ones of the huts are a bit
                    harsh, but I have some more carefully drawn ones. </p>
                <p> I’ll make you a consignment of rolled-up paintings as soon as the seascapes are
                    dry. Do you see the cheek of these idiots in Dordrecht, do you see that
                    self-importance, they’re very happy to condescend to Degas and Pissarro — of
                    whose work they’ve seen nothing, by the way, any more than of the others. But
                    it’s a very good sign that the young ones are furious, perhaps it proves that
                    there are some old ones who’ve spoken well of it. About staying in the south,
                    even if it’s more expensive — Look, we love Japanese painting, we’ve experienced
                    its influence — all the Impressionists have that in common — and we wouldn’t go
                    to Japan, in other words, to what is the equivalent of Japan, the south? So I
                    believe that the future of the new art still lies in the south after all. But
                    it’s bad policy to live there alone when two or three could help each other to
                    live on little. </p>
                <p>I’d like you to spend some time here, you’d feel it — after some time your vision
                    changes, you see with a more Japanese eye, you feel colour differently. I’m also
                    convinced that it’s precisely through a long stay here that I’ll bring out my
                    personality. The Japanese draws quickly, very quickly, like a flash of
                    lightning, because his nerves are finer, his feeling simpler. I’ve been here
                    only a few months but — tell me, in Paris would I have drawn in an hour the
                    drawing of the boats? Not even with the frame. Now this was done without
                    measuring, letting the pen go. So I tell myself that gradually the expenses will
                    be balanced by work. I’d like us to earn a lot of money to bring good artists
                    here who too often get despondent in the mud on the Petit Boulevard. Fortunately
                    it’s extremely easy to sell the right sort of paintings in the right sort of
                    place to the right sort of gentleman. Since the distinguished Albert gave us the
                    formula, all our difficulties have disappeared by magic. You only have to go
                    down rue de la Paix — there strolls, just for that purpose — the good art lover.
                    If Gauguin came here, he and I could perhaps accompany Bernard to Africa when he
                    goes there to do his service. What have you decided about our two sisters?</p>
                <p>Anquetin and Lautrec — I think — won’t like what I’m doing. Apparently an article
                    on Anquetin has appeared in the Revue Indépendante in which he seems to have
                    been called the leader of a new movement in which Japonism was even more marked,
                    &amp;c. I haven’t read it, but after all — the leader of the Petit Boulevard is
                    without any doubt Seurat, and young Bernard has perhaps gone further than
                    Anquetin in the Japanese style. Tell them I have a painting of boats, that and
                    the Langlois bridge could suit Anquetin. What Pissarro says is true — the
                    effects colours produce through their harmonies or discords should be boldly
                    exaggerated. It’s the same as in drawing — the precise drawing, the right colour
                    — is not perhaps the essential element we should look for — because the
                    reflection of reality in the mirror, if it was possible to fix it with colour
                    and everything — would in no way be a painting, any more than a photograph. More
                    soon, handshake.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo —</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>If Gauguin wants to accept, and if the only obstacle to going into business would
                    be the travel, it’s better not to keep him waiting. So I’ve written, although I
                    hardly had the time, having two canvases on the easel. If you think the letter’s
                    clear enough, send it, if not, it would be better for us, too, to abstain when
                    in doubt. And the things you would do for him shouldn’t upset the plan to bring
                    our sisters over, and especially not our needs, yours and mine. Because if we
                    ourselves don’t keep ourselves in a state of vigour, how can we claim the right
                    to get involved in other people’s troubles? But at present we’re on the way to
                    remaining vigorous, and so let’s do the possible, what’s right in front of
                        us.<work stage="sketch" origin="new"> I’m sending you enclosed herewith

                    with his canvas.</p>
                <p>If you send me the next letter by Sunday morning, I’ll probably go off to
                    Saintes-Maries again at 1 o’clock that day and spend the week there. I’m reading
                    a book about Wagner which I’ll send you afterwards — what an artist — one like
                    that in painting, now that would be something. It will come. Do you know that at
                    6 rue Coëtlogon, rue de Rennes, on 7 and 8 June from 1 to 7 o’clock there’s an
                    exhibition of paintings and drawings by Régamey that could be very interesting;
                    now there’s two who’ve travelled all over the place, he and his brother.</p>

                <p>I believe in the victory of Gauguin and other artists — but — between then and
                    now there’s a long time, and even if he had the good fortune to sell one or two
                    canvases — it would be the same story. While waiting, Gauguin could peg out like
                    Meryon, discouraged. It’s bad that he’s not working — well, we’ll see his reply.

            <salutation>My dear Theo, </salutation>
            <body>
                <p>On Monday morning I received your telegraphed money order for 50 francs, for
                    which I thank you kindly. But I haven’t yet received your letter, which
                    surprised me a little. I’ve received a letter from Gauguin, who said he’d
                    received a letter from you containing 50 francs, by which he was very touched,
                    and in which you said a few words about the plan. As I had sent you my letter to
                    him, he hadn’t yet received the more clear-cut proposal when he wrote. But he
                    says that he has the experience that when he was in Martinique with his friend
                    Laval, the two of them together managed better than either one of them alone,
                    and that he therefore fully agreed on the advantages a life in common would
                    have. He says the pains in his bowels are still continuing, and he seems quite
                    unhappy to me. He talks about a hope he has of finding capital of six hundred
                    thousand francs to set up a dealer in Impressionist paintings, and that he would
                    explain his plan and that he’d like you to be at the head of this business. I
                    shouldn’t be surprised if that hope is a fata Morgana, a mirage that goes with
                    being broke. The more broke you are — especially when you’re ill — the more you
                    think of such possibilities. So I see first and foremost in this plan yet
                    another proof that he’s despondent, and that the best thing would be get him
                    back on his feet as quickly as possible. </p>
                <p>He says that when sailors have to move a heavy load or raise an anchor, in order
                    to be able to lift a greater weight, to be able to make an enormous effort, they
                    all sing together to support each other and to give each other energy. That it’s
                    just what artists lack. So I’d be really surprised if he weren’t glad to come.
                    But the costs of the hotel and the journey are made even more complicated by the
                    doctor’s bill, so it will be jolly hard. But it seems to me that he should ditch
                    the debt and leave some paintings as security if he’s going to come here, and if
                    the people don’t agree to that, leave the debt in the lurch without any
                    paintings as security. Wasn’t I forced to do the same thing in order to come to
                    Paris? And although I suffered the loss of many things then, it can’t be done
                    otherwise in cases like that, and it’s better to go forward anyway than to go on
                    being depressed. I haven’t left for Saintes-Maries — they’ve finished painting
                    the house and I had to pay, and I also have to buy quite a considerable supply
                    of canvas. And out of the fifty francs I’ve got one louis left and we’re only
                    Tuesday morning, and so it was hardly possible for me to leave and I fear it
                    won’t yet be possible next week either. </p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="friendship">I was pleased to learn that Mourier has come to
                        lodge with you</unstress>. If Gauguin would prefer to take the risk of
                    throwing himself back into business at this point — if he really has hopes of
                    doing something in Paris — for Heaven’s sake let him go there, but I think he’d
                    be wiser to come here for a year at least; I’ve seen someone here who had been
                    to Tonkin and was ill when he came back from that delightful region — he
                    recovered here. I have two or three new drawings and also 2 or three new painted
                    studies.</p>
                <p>I went to Tarascon one day, unfortunately there was so much sun and dust that day
                    that I came home empty-handed. I’ve had reports of 2 Monticellis in Marseille, a
                    bouquet of flowers at 250 francs and figures. It was Russell’s friend,
                    Macknight, who had seen them there. I’d very much like to go there sometime, to
                    Marseille. I still continue to find the subjects here very beautiful and
                    interesting, and despite the vexations of expenses, I nevertheless think there’s
                    a better chance in the south than in the north. If you saw the Camargue — and
                    many other places — like me, you’d be very surprised to see that it has a
                    character absolutely à la Ruisdael. </p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="career">I have a new subject on the go</unstress>, green and
                    yellow fields as far as the eye can see, which I’ve already drawn twice and am
                    starting again as a painting, just like a Salomon Koninck, you know, Rembrandt’s
                    pupil who made the vast flat landscapes. Or it’s like something by Michel or
                    like Jules Dupré, but it’s really quite different from rose gardens. It’s true
                    that I’ve only visited one part of Provence, and in the other part there’s the
                    countryside that Claude Monet does, for example. I’m very curious to know what
                    Gauguin will do. He says that in the past he got people to buy Impressionists to
                    the tune of 35 thousand at Durand-Ruel’s, and that he hopes to do the same thing
                    again for you. But it’s so bad, when you start having trouble with your health
                    you can no longer risk sudden impulses, and I think Gauguin’s most solid asset
                    is now his painting, and the best business he could do, his own paintings. It’s
                    likely that he’ll have written to you in the past few days; I answered his
                    letter last Saturday. I believe it would be pretty hard to pay all he owes over
                    there and his fare, &amp;c. &amp;c. If Russell bought a painting from him — but
                    he has the house he’s building, which puts him in financial difficulties. But
                    I’ll still write to that effect, I think. I have to send him something myself
                    for our exchange, and if Gauguin wishes to come, then I’ll be able to ask with
                    confidence. It’s certain that if in exchange for the money we’d give G. we buy
                    his paintings at the current price, it’s in no way money wasted. I’d very much
                    like you to have all his paintings of Martinique. Anyway, let’s do what we can.
                    Handshake, I hope you’ll write soon. </p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo, </salutation>
            <body>
                <p>When in doubt, it’s better to abstain — that, I believe, is what I said in the
                    letter to Gauguin, and that’s what I believe now, having read his reply. If he,
                    for his part, returns to the proposal — he’s perfectly free to return to it —
                    but we’d look I’m not quite sure what, if for the moment we pressed the point,
                    to make him say yes. You see that I’ve received your letter; I thank you very
                    much for it and there were many things in it, I thank you very much for the
                    100-franc note — as for the delay with the telegram, it was dated Sunday, so
                    it’s the postman’s fault, but it hardly mattered, since the coach for
                    Saintes-Maries leaves every day. <stress reason="money">But what stopped me was
                        the need to buy canvases and pay the rent.</stress> I have already mentioned
                    to you that I didn’t like Tasset’s canvas very much for outdoor work. In future
                    I think we’ll take the ordinary kind. I bought 50 francs’ worth of canvas with
                    stretching frames — also because I need stretching frames of different sizes to
                    stretch canvases on, even though I’ll send them to you rolled up. They’re the
                    rather large sizes, 30, 25, 20, 15, all square. It seems to me that the large
                    sizes (after all, it’s not very large) suit me better. But I speak about what
                    you write in your letter. I congratulate you on having the Monet exhibition at
                    your premises, and I much regret not seeing it. It will certainly do Tersteeg no
                    harm to have seen this exhibition; he’ll still come round to it, but as your
                    idea was too, very late. It’s indeed curious that he’s changed his mind on the
                    subject of Zola. I know from experience that he couldn’t bear to hear him spoken
                    about. What an odd character Tersteeg is; we shouldn’t give up hope with him —
                    the splendid thing about him is that however rigid and fixed his opinions may
                    be, once he has acknowledged that something is in fact different from what he
                    had imagined — as with Zola — then he changes and becomes bold for the cause.
                    Unfortunately, we don’t get to be old in modern times, and Mr Tersteeg has lived
                    longer now than he still has to live. And where is his successor? My God, what a
                    sad thing it is that you and he are not entirely as one in business matters
                    these days. But what can you say — it’s what I believe they call a fatality. You
                    were fortunate to meet Guy de Maupassant — I’ve just read his first book, Des
                    vers, poems dedicated to his master, Flaubert. There’s one, ‘Au bord de l’eau’,
                    that’s already him. So you see, what Vermeer of Delft is beside Rembrandt among
                    painters, he is among French novelists beside Zola. In short, Tersteeg’s visit
                    isn’t at all what I’d dared hope, and I make no secret of it to myself that I
                    miscalculated the odds on his cooperating. And perhaps on the business with
                    Gauguin, too. Let’s take a look at that: I thought he was at bay and I blame
                    myself for having money and the pal who works better than I, not — I say, he’s
                    entitled to half if he wishes. But — if Gauguin isn’t at bay, then I’m not in
                    too much of a hurry. </p>

                <p>And I categorically withdraw from it, and the only question for me remains quite
                    simply this: If I looked for a pal to work with, would I be doing the right
                    thing, would this be more beneficial to my brother and me, would the pal lose or
                    would he gain by it? So these, then, are questions that certainly preoccupy me,
                    but which need to come face to face with reality in order to become actual
                    facts. I don’t wish to discuss Gauguin’s plan, having considered the situation
                    once — last winter — you know the results. You know that I believe that an
                    association of the Impressionists would be something along the lines of the
                    associations of the 12 English Pre-Raphaelites, and that I believe that it could
                    come into being. That I’m therefore inclined to believe that the artists would
                    guarantee their livelihood amongst themselves, mutually, and independently of
                    the dealers, each agreeing to give a substantial number of paintings to the
                    society, and that earnings as well as losses would be shared. I don’t believe
                    that this society would last indefinitely, but I believe that during its
                    lifetime we would live courageously and would produce. <stress
                        reason="environment">But if tomorrow Gauguin and his banker Jews come and
                        ask me for nothing but 10 paintings for a society of dealers and not a
                        society of artists, well, I don’t know if I’d trust them — I who would be
                        glad, on the other hand, to give 50 to a society of artists. </stress>Isn’t
                    it a bit the way it was with Reid — why say that Gabriel de la Roquette’s a
                    scoundrel if you do the same yourself? Why say artistic Society if it’s made up
                    of bankers? Enough, for Heaven’s sake, let our pal do as his heart tells him,
                        <stress reason="career">but his plan is far from making me
                        enthusiastic.</stress> I prefer things as they are — to take them the way it
                    is, without changing anything about them, to half-baked reforms. The great
                    revolution, art for the artists, my God, perhaps it’s a utopia, and too bad,
                    then. </p>
                <p> I think life’s so short and goes by so fast. Now, being a painter you have to
                    paint, all the same. And you’re also well aware that because at that time — last
                    winter with Pissarro and the others, we happened to talk about it a lot, I’m now
                    making a big effort to add nothing more except this, that speaking for myself,
                    before next year I want to make my contribution of 50 paintings. If I manage to
                    do that then I’ll stick to my opinion. I’ve sent you <work mention="vague">3
                        drawings by post today</work>.</p>
                <p>The one with the wheat stacks in a farmyard will seem too bizarre to you, but it
                    was done in great haste as a project for a painting, and it’s to show you what
                    it’s like. Now, the harvest is a bit more serious. And that’s the subject I’ve
                    been working on this week, on a no. 30 canvas — it’s hardly done at all — but it
                    kills the rest of what I have, apart from a still life, worked on with patience.
                    Macknight and one of his friends who’s been in Africa too saw this study today
                    and said it was the best I’d done. Like Anquetin and our friend Thomas — you’re
                    really not sure what to think of yourself when you hear people say that, but I
                    say to myself: the rest must look bloody awful, to be sure. Well then — on days
                    when I bring back a study I say to myself, if it was like this every day things
                    could work — but on days when you come home empty-handed and you eat and spend
                    money all the same, you don’t feel content with yourself, and you feel like a
                    madman, a scoundrel or an old fool. And dear old Doctor Ox, I mean our Swede,
                    Mourier, I liked him well enough because, with his spectacles, he went naїvely
                    and benignly about this wicked world, and because I presumed he had a heart that
                    was purer than many a heart, and even with more of a leaning towards rectitude
                    than many of the cleverest people have. And as I knew he hadn’t been painting
                    for very long it made not a bit of difference to me that his work was the very
                    height of inanity. And I saw him every day for months. All right. So what can be
                    the reason for his losing his qualities? This is how I imagine the case to be.
                    Bear in mind that he came to the south to get over a nervous disorder caused by
                    a whole lot of problems he’s had, and as a result of which he changed career. </p>
                <p> He was perfectly well here, he was very calm, &amp;c. But the shock of Paris was
                    too great, the change too sudden, he didn’t find the Paris of his dreams, and
                    there he is, worried and perhaps disagreeable, and in any case doing silly
                    things. He’ll soon have sown his wild oats, I hope. While waiting, let him do
                    whatever he likes without attaching any importance to it. He’s placing huge
                    hopes in Russell (I believe), he’s looking for an adviser and a teacher — now —
                    no need to tell you that Russell will perhaps not be everything he needs, but I
                    believe that Russell will see that he’s someone who doesn’t know the circles of
                    people with whom he’s dealing, and I think that Russell will take him seriously
                    and will try to be good for him. I believe that Russell is making a name for
                    himself among those who have an instinctive fear of Paris. It’s hard to explain
                    what I mean by that. Russell is such a good man — but you know, you can’t
                    recommend that people love Paris, or force them to, any more than you can
                    recommend a pipe or black coffee with cognac. And Russell’s rich and has lost
                    money in Paris, so he can and does say to people: ‘see what I’ve had to deal
                    with’. But in any event, I’ll write a word to Russell. It seems that Macknight
                    wasn’t very pleased with me but that Russell indicated to him in reply that he
                    should shut up. All this to tell you I understand very, very well — seeing he
                    has turned out like that — that you’re not in complete agreement with the Swede,
                    who probably, according to what you write, has had a recurrence of his nervous
                    trouble and is irritated by Paris. If he has money to waste in taking a studio
                    like Gérôme’s, it would be serious. As I’m slightly doubtful that he has a huge
                    amount to waste, he’s in for a bit of a drubbing that’s not undeserved, I’d say.
                    There’s nothing to be done if he won’t listen, but you can’t live with him. I
                    won’t write to Gauguin direct — I’ll send you the letter — because when in
                    doubt, it’s better to abstain. IF WE SAY NO MORE, if the reply shows we’ve said
                    something like that but that there has to be an initiative in the matter from
                    his side too, then we’ll see if he’s keen on it. If he isn’t keen on it, if it’s
                    all one to him, if he has something quite different in mind, let him remain
                    independent, and me too. Handshake to you and to Mourier.</p>

            <ps>
                <p>I find this in particular rather strange in this plan of Gauguin’s: the society
                    offers its protection in exchange for 10 paintings that the artists will have to
                    give, if ten artists do that, the Jewish company clearly pockets 100 paintings
                    ‘for a start’. The protection of this society that doesn’t even exist costs a
                    lot of money. </p>


                <p>Here’s the letter for Gauguin — I’m well aware that in his there is this passage
                    ‘I ask (underlined) if, the capital having been raised for the most part, your
                    brother would use his efforts to make a success of the business and to be its
                    director’. I’m well aware that he also writes, ‘I accept your proposal in
                    principle’. But I believe that it could lead us too far if we weren’t a little
                    firm in showing him that our proposal was without all these afterthoughts, and
                    that we ourselves<stress reason="money"> are too hard up to be able to risk
                        anything other than setting up house together and sharing the month’s
                        money</stress>. And it’s true I didn’t know he had so large a family; he’ll
                    more likely wish to stay in the north for that reason. The most radical thing we
                    could do would be for me to give up the south, and if that would get him out of
                    trouble, go and join him in Brittany myself. And the desire I have to work in
                    the south is naturally subordinate to the interests of people like him. All the
                    same, we shouldn’t change lightly. </p>
                <p>And I’m a little afraid of getting a dressing-down for having separated him from
                    his family, or a hornet’s nest like that. Dear God, if he has such a large
                    family his obligations are probably not to be absent from them any more. And
                    perhaps he’d be much happier if you simply bought a painting from him from time
                    to time. </p>
                <p>If now I haven’t mentioned these two passages and other passages in his letter
                    it’s because it seems far too difficult to me to say yes to that in all honesty.
                    However, if it was the case that his whole plan is nothing but a fata Morgana,
                    and as such will vanish, he’ll speak of it again of his own accord. But there’s
                    the fare, the debt at the inn, the doctor’s bill; now he’s talking about another
                    debt of 300 francs which he’ll settle with that painting if his collector
                    agrees. But if he doesn’t agree? Well now, it wouldn’t be very prudent to give
                    him hopes beyond our resources and commit ourselves to doing more than we could
                    stick to. It’s all very well for Gauguin to say, he’s very very upset and it’s a
                    pity, and it can’t be good for his work. No, we shouldn’t change what we’ve said
                    and consider that the thing isn’t going ahead because of doubts and changes
                    whose presence isn’t a good sign. <unstress reason="career">The more I calm
                        myself here and the more I regain my strength, the more I feel that work is
                        the most secure thing</unstress>. I admit that if living in <stress
                        reason="money">Brittany is much less expensive, if necessary I must
                        sacrifice my plan to work here, and I’ll do it willingly if it’s to his
                        benefit</stress>. But all the more reason to work hard on the 50 paintings I
                    wished to have before talking again about projects of the kind we discussed last
                    winter. A letter from home arrives just now. You know I feel so well now that it
                    isn’t indispensable that I stay here for my health alone. We have to act so that
                    you aren’t completely overwhelmed by expenses, that’s what’s necessary and
                    that’s serious enough in itself. </p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Many thanks for your letter and the 50-franc note it contained. I didn’t know
                    that the article on Claude Monet was by the same hand as the one on Bismarck. It
                    does you good to read things like that, more than the majority of articles by
                    the Decadents, with their fondness for saying the most banal things in strangely
                    convoluted ways.<stress reason="career"> I’m really unhappy with what I’ve done
                        these past few days, because it’s very ugly.</stress> And yet the figure
                    interests me much more than landscape. I’ll send you a drawing of the Zouave
                    today all the same.</p>
                <p>To do studies of figures, to attempt them and to learn would still after all be
                    the shortest route for me to do something of value. Bernard’s in the same
                    position. Today he sends me a croquis of a brothel that I’m sending you enclosed
                    herewith to pin up next to the acrobats by him that you have. On the back of the
                    drawing there’s a poem with very much the same tone as the drawing, it’s likely
                    that he has a more finished painted study of it. </p>
                <p>I wouldn’t be surprised if he wanted to make an exchange with me for the head of
                    a Zouave, although that one’s very ugly. But as I wouldn’t wish to deprive him
                    of saleable studies I wouldn’t suggest an exchange unless at the same time we
                    could buy something from him for a small sum. It’s still raining a lot here,
                    which does a lot of damage to the wheat, which is still standing. But luckily I
                    had a model these past few days.</p>
                <p>I’ll need a book, A B C D du dessin by A. Cassagne. I requested it at the
                    bookshop here, and after waiting a fortnight they tell me they need the name of
                    the publisher, which I don’t know. If you could send me it I’d be very pleased.
                        <stress reason="environment">The negligence, the lazy carelessness of people
                        here is indescribable and one is really put out by the least
                        things.</stress> That’s the reason I’ll have to go to Marseille one of these
                    days, to be able to get what I need from over there. The cost of carriage from
                    Paris isn’t always pleasant, and makes things dearer, but there you are, to go
                    to Marseille specially, that makes them even dearer. It quite often makes me
                    feel sad that painting’s like a bad mistress one might have, who’s always
                    spending, spending and it’s never enough, and to say to myself that even if
                    there happens to be a passable study from time to time, it would be much less
                    expensive to buy them from others. The rest, the hope of doing better, is also a
                    bit of a fata Morgana.</p>
                <p>Well, there’s not much remedy for all that, unless some day or other one could
                    enter into an association with a good worker and produce more together. As for
                    the publisher of Cassagne’s book — you probably have his treatise on
                    perspective, and the address should be in it. Besides, they have these books at
                    Latouche’s, and in rue de la Chaussée d’Antin, at the place of that man who
                    always has works by Allongé. It’s very good that Claude Monet found a way of
                    making these ten pictures between February and May. To work quickly isn’t to
                    work less seriously, it depends on the confidence and experience one has. In the
                    same way, Jules Gérard the lion-hunter says in his book that at the beginning
                    young lions have a lot of trouble killing a horse or an ox, but old lions kill
                    with a single well-judged strike from a claw or a tooth, and have an amazing
                    sureness for that job. </p>
                <p>I don’t find the southern gaiety here that Daudet talks about so much, on the
                    contrary, an insipid affectation, a sordid carelessness, but that doesn’t mean
                    that the region isn’t beautiful. All the same, nature here must be very
                    different from Bordighera, Hyères, Genoa, Antibes, where there’s less mistral,
                    where the mountains give a quite different character. <unstress
                        reason="environment"> Here — except for a more intense colour, it reminds
                        one of Holland, it’s all flat — only one thinks more of the Holland of
                        Ruisdael and Hobbema and Ostade rather than the Holland of today. What
                        amazes me is how few flowers there are, so no cornflowers in the
                        wheatfields, seldom any poppies</unstress>.</p>
                <p>What was the cost of the carriage for the crate of pictures recently? <work
                        mention="vague">The impastos on some canvases are dry on the surface but not
                        enough to roll them up; if it wasn’t for that I’d send them</work>.
                    Macknight has a friend with him now, I never see any of his work, yesterday I
                    showed him and his friend four or five new studies, which they looked at in icy
                    silence. I think for their part they’re preparing a big surprise, which I hope
                    will be a good one. Because it would please me greatly to see that they’d found
                    a direction. Handshake to you and to Mourier if, that is, he hasn’t yet moved
                    into the studio like Gérôme’s. </p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo, </salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Probably in order to convince myself that, as I myself am one of the most
                    absent-minded of mortals, I have no right to criticize the people of the south
                    for their carelessness — I once again made the mistake of addressing my letter
                    to 54 rue de Laval instead of 54 rue Lepic. So when they returned the letter to
                    me opened, the people at the Post Office had the pleasure of being able to edify
                    themselves by contemplating Bernard’s brothel. I’m hurrying to send you back the
                    letter as it is. I’ve just received — this morning — part of the order for
                    colours, from Tanguy. His cobalt is too poor to order more from him. His chromes
                    are quite good, so we could continue from now on to ask him for them. But
                    instead of carmine he sends dark madder, which doesn’t matter much — but neither
                    is the carmine very reliable in his poor run-down hole. It’s not his fault, but
                    in future I’ll write Tanguy next to the names of the colours, if they can be had
                    from him. Yesterday and today I worked on the sower, which has been completely
                    reworked.</p>
                <p>The sky is yellow and green, the earth purple and orange. There’s definitely a
                    painting like that to be made of this splendid subject, and I hope it will be
                    done one day, either by someone else or by me. The question remains this —
                    Christ’s boat by Eugène Delacroix and Millet’s sower are of entirely different
                    workmanship. Christ’s boat — I’m talking about the blue and green sketch with
                    touches of purple and red and a little lemon yellow for the halo, the aureole —
                    speaks a symbolic language through colour itself. Millet’s sower is colourless
                    grey — as are Israëls’s paintings too.</p>
                <p>Can we now paint the sower with colour, with simultaneous contrast between yellow
                    and purple for example (like Delacroix’s Apollo ceiling, which is precisely
                    yellow and purple), yes or no? Yes — definitely. So do it then! — yes — that’s
                    what père Martin says too, ‘you must make the masterpiece’. But get down to it —
                    and you fall into a whole metaphysics of colours à la Monticelli, a mess from
                    which it’s damned awkward to escape with credit. And that makes you
                    absent-minded, like a sleep-walker. If only one was doing something good. Well,
                    let’s keep our courage and let’s not despair. I hope soon to send you this
                    effort, with some others. <unstress reason="environment">I have a View of the
                        Rhône — the Trinquetaille iron bridge, where the sky and the river are the
                        colour of absinthe — the quays a lilac tone, the people leaning on the
                        parapet almost black, the iron bridge an intense blue — with a bright orange
                        note in the blue background and an intense Veronese green note.</unstress>
                    <work mention="vague">One more effort that’s far from finished</work> — but one
                    at least where I’m attempting something more heartbroken and therefore more
                    heartbreaking. Nothing from Gauguin. I very much hope to receive your letter
                    tomorrow, forgive my carelessness. Handshake.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>I’ve just come back from a day at Montmajour, and my friend the second lieutenant
                    kept me company. So the two of us explored the old garden and we stole some
                    excellent figs there. If it had been bigger it would have made you think of
                    Zola’s Paradou, tall reeds, grape vines, ivy, fig trees, olive trees,
                    pomegranate trees with fat flowers of the brightest orange, hundred-year-old
                    cypresses, ash trees and willows, rock oaks. Half-demolished staircases, ruined
                    Gothic windows, clumps of white rock covered in lichen, and pieces of collapsed
                    wall scattered here and there in the undergrowth; I brought back another large
                    drawing of it. Not of the garden, though. That makes 3 drawings; when I have
                    half dozen, will send them. Yesterday I went to Fontvieille to pay a visit to
                    Boch and Macknight, but those gentlemen had left for a week for a short trip to
                        Switzerland.<unstress reason="environment">I think the heat is still doing
                        me good</unstress>, in spite of the mosquitoes and flies.</p>
                <p>The cicadas — not those at home but like this, </p>


                <p> you see them in Japanese albums. And golden and green Cantharides swarming on
                    the olive trees. These cicadas (I think their name is cicada) sing at least as
                    loudly as a frog. </p>
                <p>I had the further thought that if you care to recall that<work stage="finished"
                        origin="existing"> I painted portraits of père Tanguy</work> (which he still
                    has), of mère Tanguy (which they sold), of their friend (it’s true that I was
                    paid 20 francs by him for the latter portrait), that I bought 250 francs worth
                    of colours from Tanguy without a discount, on which he of course made a profit,
                    that after all, I was no less his friend than he was mine, I have the most
                    serious of reasons to doubt his right to demand money from me, which is actually
                    settled with the study of mine that he still has, all the more so since there’s
                    the clearly expressed condition that he would be paid with the sale of a
                    painting. Xanthippe, mère Tanguy and some other ladies have, by some strange
                    freak of nature, brains of flintstone or gunflint. Certainly these ladies are
                    much more harmful in the civilized society in which they move than the citizens
                    bitten by rabid dogs who live at the Institut Pasteur. So père Tanguy would be
                    right a thousand times over if he killed his lady.... but he doesn’t do it, any
                    more than Socrates..... And for that reason père Tanguy is more closely
                    connected — in terms of resignation and long patience — with the early Christian
                    martyrs and slaves than with present-day Paris pimps. Which doesn’t mean there’s
                    any reason to pay him 80 francs, but there are reasons for never losing your
                    temper with him, even if he might lose his temper when, rightly so in this case,
                    you kick him out, or at least send him packing in no uncertain terms. </p>
                <p>I’m writing to Russell at the same time — we probably know, don’t we, that the
                    English, the Yankees &amp;c. have this in common with the Dutch, that their
                    charity — — .................... is very Christian. Now, the rest of us not
                    being very good Christians........... That’s what I can’t stop myself thinking
                    as I write once again. That Boch looks a bit like a Flemish gentleman from the
                    time of the compromise of the nobles in the time of the Silent one and of
                    Marnix. I wouldn’t be at all surprised if he was good. I’ve written to Russell
                    that for our exchange I’d send him my consignment rolled up, straight to his
                    home, if I knew he was in Paris. This way he should in any case reply to me in
                    the next few days.</p>
                <p>And now I’ll need more canvas and paint soon. Only I don’t yet have the address
                    for that canvas at 40 francs for 20 metres. I believe that at this moment I’m
                    doing the right thing by working chiefly on drawings, and seeing to it that I
                    have colours and canvas in reserve for the time when Gauguin comes. I very much
                    wish we could rein ourselves in as little with paint as with pen and paper. </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="money">Because I’m afraid of wasting paint, I often spoil a
                        painted study. With paper — if it’s not a letter I’m writing but a drawing
                        I’m doing — it hardly ever goes wrong: so many sheets of Whatman, so many
                        drawings. I think if I were rich I’d spend less than now.</stress> Ah well —
                    père Martin would say — then we’ll have to make sure we get rich — and he’s
                    quite right, just as he is about the masterpiece.</p>
                <p>Do you remember in Guy de Maupassant the gentleman who hunted rabbits and other
                    game and who had hunted so hard for 10 years and was so worn out with running
                    after game that at the point when he wanted to get married he couldn’t get a
                    hard-on, which caused him the greatest anxieties and consternation. <unstress
                        reason="career">Without being in this gentleman’s position as far as having
                        or wishing to get married, in the physical sense I’m beginning to resemble
                        him. According to the excellent master Ziem, a man becomes ambitious the
                        moment he can’t get a hard-on. Now, while it’s more or less the same to me
                        whether or not I can get a hard-on, I protest when it must inevitably lead
                        me to ambition.</unstress> There is no one but the greatest philosopher of
                    his time and of his country, and therefore of all countries and all times — the
                    excellent master Pangloss — who could — if here were there — give me advice and
                    calm my soul. </p>
                <p>There we are — the letter for Russell is in its envelope — and I’ve written as I
                    thought. I asked him if he had news of Reid, and I put the same question to you.
                    I told Russell that he was perfectly at liberty to take what he might want, and
                    from the first consignment too. And that I was only waiting for a categorical
                    answer to know whether he wanted to choose at his home or yours. That in the
                    first case, if he wanted to see them at his home — you’d send him some orchards
                    too. And that you’d have all of them brought back, once he’d made his choice. So
                    he can’t say anything to that. If he doesn’t buy a Gauguin it’s because he
                    can’t. If he can do it, I’d be inclined to hope he will do it. I told him that
                    if I was bold enough to insist on a purchase, it wasn’t that without him the
                    thing wouldn’t come about, but that Gauguin having been ill, and given the
                    complication that he’d been in bed and had to pay his doctor, the business was
                    rather hard for us and we were all the more eager to find a collector for a
                    painting. I think about Gauguin a lot, and would have plenty of ideas for
                    paintings and for work in general. At the moment I have a charwoman, who sweeps
                    and scrubs the house twice a week for 1 franc; I place great hopes in her, to be
                    able to count on her making the beds if we decide to sleep at home. On the other
                    hand, there’s a possible arrangement with the chap where I’m lodging at the
                    moment. Anyway, we’ll try to ensure that in the end it’ll be a saving instead of
                    an expense. How’s your health now? Are you still seeing Gruby? What you were
                    saying about that conversation at the Nouvelle Athènes is interesting. You’re
                    familiar with Desboutin’s little portrait that Portier has. It’s certainly a
                    strange phenomenon that all artists, poets, musicians, painters are unfortunate
                    in the material sense — even the happy ones — what you were saying recently
                    about Guy de Maupassant proves it once again. That rakes up the eternal
                    question: is life visible to us in its entirety, or before we die do we know of
                    only one hemisphere? </p>
                <p>Painters — to speak only of them — being dead and buried, speak to a following
                    generation or to several following generations through their works. Is that all,
                    or is there more, even? In the life of the painter, death may perhaps not be the
                    most difficult thing. For myself, I declare I don’t know anything about
                        it.<unstress reason="environment"> But the sight of the stars always makes
                        me dream in as simple a way as the black spots on the map, representing
                        towns and villages, make me dream. Why, I say to myself, should the spots of
                        light in the firmament be less accessible to us than the black spots on the
                        map of France.</unstress> Just as we take the train to go to Tarascon or
                    Rouen, we take death to go to a star. What’s certainly true in this argument is
                    that while alive, we cannot go to a star, any more than once dead we’d be able
                    to take the train.<unstress reason="environment"> So it seems to me not
                        impossible that cholera, the stone, consumption, cancer are celestial means
                        of locomotion, just as steamboats, omnibuses and the railway are terrestrial
                        ones. To die peacefully of old age would be to go there on foot.
                    </unstress>For the moment I’m going to go to bed because it’s late, and I wish
                    you good-night and good luck. Handshake.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Many thanks for your letter, <unstress reason="friendship">which gave me great
                        pleasure</unstress>, coming just at the moment when I was still dazed by the
                    sun and the strain of handling a rather large canvas.<work stage="finished"
                        origin="new"> I have a new drawing of a garden full of flowers</work>; <work
                        stage="finished" origin="new">I also have two painted studies of it</work>.
                    I must send you a rather large new order for canvas and colours. Only it’s not
                    at all urgent. What, if anything, would be urgent would rather be the canvas,
                    seeing that I have a whole lot of stretching frames from which I’ve removed the
                    studies, and on which in the meantime I must put other canvases. </p>




                <p>You’ll see from this croquis the subject of the new studies; there’s one vertical
                    and one horizontal one of the same subject — no. 30 canvases. There’s definitely
                    a subject for a painting among them — as in some other studies that I have. And
                    truly, I don’t know if I’ll ever do tranquil and calmly worked paintings,
                    myself, as it seems to me that it will always remain disjointed. Have you any
                    news from Gauguin? I wrote to him again last week, to know how it was going with
                    his health and his work. No reply from Russell, who’s probably not in Paris,
                    judging by what Macknight was saying, who has come back with Boch. Still icy
                    silence about the work when they come. What you say about Princenhage, it’s true
                    that it’s the same story all over again — but when at long last the fellow isn’t
                    there any more, then for his little circle it will be one more emptiness and
                    desolation. And even the rest of us would feel it, because there’s something
                    heartbreaking in the fact that when we were younger we saw so much of him, and
                    we were even influenced by him. </p>
                <p>So, seeing someone whom one has known as very active reduced to that state of
                    suspicious helplessness and constant suffering, it certainly doesn’t give you an
                    appealing or cheerful notion of human life, and doesn’t add to the joy of
                    living. Our mother in Breda, she must be getting on a bit, too. Without meaning
                    to — is it the effect of nature down here, so Ruisdaelesque? — I quite often
                    think of Holland, and with the double separation of distance and time that has
                    passed, these memories have something heartbreaking about them. What you write
                    about Reid isn’t very cheerful either — at times he used to speak so often of
                    making himself a painter, and of retiring to live with an aunt in the country,
                    that it’s just possible that he’s carrying out this plan now. What does Maria
                    say? But perhaps she’s disappeared too. I believe all the same that the constant
                    wind here must have something to do with the fact that the painted studies have
                    that wild look. Because you also see it in Cézanne. </p>
                <p>What must make it easier for the Japanese to stuff their works of art into
                    drawers and cupboards is that you can roll kakemonos but not our painted
                    studies, which would eventually flake. Nothing would make it easier for us to
                    place our canvases than to get them widely accepted as decorations in bourgeois
                    homes. As in Holland in the old days. And here in the south it would do a hell
                    of a lot of good to see paintings on the white walls. But go and look: big,
                    coloured Julien medallions everywhere — horrors. And alas, we won’t change
                    anything in this state of affairs. However — cafés — perhaps we’ll decorate them
                    later on. More soon, handshake.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo, </salutation>
            <body>
                <p>I’m sending you Gauguin’s letter enclosed herewith; fortunately he’s regaining
                    his health. How is yours?</p>
                <p>I’d very much like it if Russell were to do something — however, he has a wife,
                    children, a studio, a house under construction, and I can very well imagine that
                    even a rich man may not always be able to spend 100 francs — were it only that —
                    on paintings. I believe that it would make an enormous difference to me if
                    Gauguin was here,<stress reason="friendship"> because the days pass now without
                        saying a word to anyone</stress>. Ah, well. In any case, his letter gave me
                    tremendous pleasure. <stress reason="environment">Being too long alone in the
                        country you become dull-witted, and not just yet — but this winter, I could
                        become sterile from that</stress>. Now this danger will no longer exist if
                    he comes, because we won’t be short of ideas. </p>
                <p>If work goes well and if we don’t lack guts, there’s the hope of seeing very
                    interesting years in the future. Is Mourier still with you? Would it be possible
                    for me to have your letter on Sunday? I’m not counting on it, though, knowing
                    that it’s the end of the month. It’s just that I’ll probably have a model this
                    week.</p>
                <p>I have a really great need for some studies of figures. At the moment I have
                    something like an exhibition at my place, in the sense that I’ve taken all the
                    studies off the stretching frames and have nailed them to the wall to finish
                    drying. You’ll see that when there’s a large number of them, and we make a
                    choice among them, it will come to the same thing as if I’d studied them more
                    and worked on them longer.<stress reason="career"> Because to do a subject over
                        and over again on the same canvas or on several canvases comes, in short, to
                        the same degree of seriousness. I’m somewhat rushed</stress>, so handshake
                    and </p>

                <date>Sunday, 29 July 1888.</date>
            </head>
            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Many thanks for your kind letter. If you recall, mine ended with: we’re getting
                    old, that’s what is and the rest is imagination and doesn’t exist. Now, I said
                    that even more for myself, than for you. And I said it feeling the absolute
                    necessity for me to act accordingly, to work, not more, perhaps, but with a more
                    serious conception. Now you talk about the emptiness you sometimes feel; that’s
                    just the same thing that I have, too. Considering, if you will, the times in
                    which we live as a true and great revival of art, the moth-eaten and official
                    tradition, which is still on its feet, but which is at bottom powerless and
                    bone-idle, <stress reason="environment">the new painters, alone, poor, treated
                        like madmen and as a result of this treatment becoming so in fact, at least
                        as far as their social life is concerned.</stress> Then remember that you do
                    exactly the same work as these primitive painters, since you provide them with
                    money and you sell their canvases for them, which enables them to produce
                    others. <stress reason="career">If a painter ruins his character by working hard
                        at painting, which makes him sterile for many things, for family life,
                        &amp;c. &amp;c</stress>. If as a consequence he paints not only with paint
                    but with self-denial and self-abnegation and a broken heart. Not only are you
                    not paid for your own work either, but it costs you exactly the same as this
                    effacement of personality, half deliberate, half accidental, costs a painter.
                    This is to say that if you do painting indirectly, you’re more productive than
                    me, for example. The more completely you become a dealer, the more you become an
                    artist. Just as I very much hope to be in the same case... <stress
                        reason="career">The more I become dissipated, ill, a broken pitcher, the
                        more I too become a creative artist in that great revival of art of which
                        we’re speaking.</stress> These things are indeed so, but this eternally
                    existing art and this revival — this green shoot growing from the roots of the
                    old felled trunk — these are things so spiritual that a kind of melancholy
                    remains with us when we reflect that at less expense we could have made life
                    instead of making art. You really ought, if you can, to make me feel that art is
                    alive, you who perhaps love art more than I do. I say to myself that that
                    doesn’t have to do with art, but with me, that the only way for me to regain
                    self-confidence and tranquillity is by doing better. And here we are again at
                    the end of my last letter — I’m getting old, but it’s only imagination if I were
                    to believe that art is an old, stale thing.</p>
                <p>Now, if you know what a ‘mousmé’ is (you’ll know when you’ve read Loti’s Madame
                    Chrysanthème), I’ve just painted one. It took me my whole week, I wasn’t able to
                    do anything else, having been not too well again. That’s what annoys me, if I’d
                    been well I’d have knocked off some more landscapes in between times. But in
                    order to finish off my mousmé I had to save my mental powers. A mousmé is a
                    Japanese girl — Provençale in this case — aged between 12 and 14. That makes 2
                    figures, the Zouave, and her, that I have.</p>
                <p>Look after your health, take baths, especially if Gruby recommends that you do.
                    Because you’ll see in 4 years, the years by which I’m older than you, how far
                    relative health is necessary in order to be able to work. Now we who work with
                    our heads, our only and unique means of avoiding being finished too soon is the
                    artificial prolongation of modern hygiene, rigorously followed, as far as we can
                    endure it. Because I for one don’t do everything that I should do. And a little
                    good cheer is better than any other remedy.</p>
                <p>I have a letter from Russell. He says that he would have written to me before had
                    it not been that his move to Belle-Île had absorbed him. He’s there now, and
                    says that he’d be pleased if sooner or later I came to spend some time there. He
                    still wants to do my portrait again. He even says, ‘I would have gone to
                    Boussod’s to see the Gauguin, negresses talking, had it not been that I was
                    prevented from doing so for the same reason’. In short, he’s not refusing to buy
                    one, but is making it understood that he wouldn’t want poorer quality than ours.
                    You see that this is in any case better than nothing at all. I’ll write this to
                    Gauguin and will ask him for croquis of paintings. We shouldn’t push this
                    business and give up on R. for the time being, but consider the thing as an
                    ongoing piece of business that will come off. And the same for Guillaumin, I’d
                    like him to buy a figure by G. He says he’s received a very fine bust of his
                    wife from Rodin, and that on that occasion he lunched with Claude Monet and that
                    he saw the 10 paintings of Antibes then. I’m sending him Geffroy’s article. He
                    makes a very good critique of the Monets, first of all liking them very much:
                    the difficulty attacked, the envelope of coloured air, the colour. Now after
                    that he says, what must be repeated is that it all lacks construction
                    everywhere, for example, with him a tree will have far too much foliage for the
                    size of the trunk, and so always and everywhere, from the point of view of the
                    reality of things, from the point of view of a whole number of laws of nature,
                    he’s pretty well hopeless. He ends by saying that this quality of attacking
                    difficulties is what everyone should have.</p>
                <p>I’ve received from Bernard 10 croquis like his brothel; there are 3 of them that
                    are in the style of Redon; the enthusiasm that he has for that I don’t much
                    share myself. But there’s a woman washing herself, very Rembrandtesque, or in
                    the style of Goya, and a very strange landscape with figures. He expressly
                    forbids me to send them to you, but you’ll receive them by the same post. I
                    think Russell will buy something else from Bernard. Now I’ve seen work by this
                    Boch; it’s rigorously Impressionist but not powerful, at this moment when this
                    new technique is still preoccupying him too much to allow him to be himself.
                    He’ll become stronger and will bring out his individuality, I think. But
                    Macknight does watercolours of the power of those by Destrée, you know, that
                    vile Dutchman we knew back in the old days. However, he’d washed some small
                    still lifes, yellow jug on purple foreground, red jug on green, orange jug on
                    blue: better, but it’s pretty poor. The village where they’re staying is pure
                    Millet, small peasants, nothing but that, totally rustic and intimate. That
                    character completely escapes them. I believe that Macknight has civilized and
                    converted to civilized Christianity his lout of a landlord. At least, when you
                    go there that scoundrel and his worthy spouse shake your hand — it’s in a café,
                    of course — when you ask for a drink they have ways of refusing the money, ‘Oh,
                    I couldn’t take money from an artiss’ (with two s’s). Anyhow, it’s their own
                    fault that it’s appalling, and this Boch must be getting pretty dull-witted with
                    Macknight. I think Macknight has money, but not much. So they contaminate the
                    village; if it weren’t for that, I’d go there often to work there. What one
                    ought to do there is not talk to civilized people; but they know the
                    stationmaster and a score of bloody nuisances, and that’s largely why they don’t
                    do a damned thing. I’ve already said that to Mourier, who once used to believe
                    that Macknight got on highly intelligently with the ‘man of the fields’.
                    Naturally, these simple and naive people of the fields make fun of them, and
                    despise them. On the contrary, if you do your work there without worrying about
                    the village idlers with their stiff collars, then you can go into the homes of
                    the peasants, enabling them to earn a few sous. And then that bloody Fontvieille
                    would be a treasure to them, but the natives are — Zola’s small peasants,
                    innocent and gentle beings, as we know.</p>
                <p>It’s likely that Macknight will shortly do little landscapes with sheep, for
                    boxes of sweets. Not just my paintings, but I myself most of all, I had recently
                    become wild-eyed, a bit like Hugo van der Goes in the painting by Emile Wauters.
                    But having had all my beard carefully shaved off, I believe that I have as much
                    of the very placid abbot in the same painting as of the mad painter so
                    intelligently depicted in it. And I’m not unhappy to be somewhere between the
                    two, because you have to live. Especially as there’s no getting away from the
                    fact that one day or another there could be a crisis if you changed as far as
                    your position with the Boussods was concerned. One more reason for maintaining
                    relations with artists on my part as well as on yours. Besides, I believe I’ve
                    told the truth, all the same. If I succeeded in bringing back in prices the
                    money spent, I would be doing no more than my duty. And the practical thing I
                    can do is the portrait. As far as drinking too much goes... I don’t know if it’s
                    bad. But just look at Bismarck, who in any case is very practical and very
                    intelligent. His little doctor told him he was drinking too much and that he’d
                    overtaxed himself all his life, from his stomach to his brain. B. stopped
                    drinking there and then. Since then he’s lost ground and is dragging along. He
                    must really be laughing inside at his doctor, whom fortunately for him he didn’t
                    consult too soon.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>It seems to me that you did well to go to our uncle’s funeral, as our mother
                    seemed to expect you. The best way of dying otherwise is to esteem the
                    illustrious departed just as he is, as being the best man in the best of
                    possible worlds, where everything is always for the best. Which being
                    uncontested and thus incontestable, we are then no doubt at liberty to return to
                    our own business afterwards. I’m pleased that our brother Cor has grown bigger
                    and stronger than the two of us. And he’ll be stupid if he doesn’t marry,
                    because he has only that and his hands. With that and his hands, or his hands
                    and that, and what he knows about machines, I for one would like to be in his
                    position if I had any sort of desire to be somebody. Meanwhile, I’m in my skin,
                    and my skin in the gear-wheels of the Beaux-Arts like the grain between the
                    millstones.</p>
                <p>Did I tell you that I sent some drawings to our friend Russell? <work
                        origin="new" stage="sketch">At the moment I’m doing the same ones, more or
                        less, for you; there’ll be 12 of them too.</work> You’ll see better then
                    what there is in the painted studies in the way of drawing. I’ve already told
                    you that I always have to struggle against the mistral, which absolutely
                    prevents one being in control of one’s touch. Hence the ‘wild’ look of the
                    studies. You’ll tell me that instead of drawing them I ought to repaint them at
                    home on other canvases. That’s what I sometimes think about, because it’s not my
                    fault that in the case given the execution lacks a more spiritual touch. What
                    would Gauguin say about it if he was here? Would he be in favour of looking for
                    a more sheltered place?</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="money">I must now tell you something disagreeable again about
                        money; it’s that I won’t manage this week, because this very day I pay 25
                        francs; I’ll have money for 5 days and not for seven.</stress> It’s Monday —
                    if I have your next letter on Saturday morning, no need then to increase the
                    contents. <work origin="existing" stage="finished">Last week I did not only one
                        but even two portraits of my postman,</work> one half-length, with hands,
                    and a life-size head. The chap, not accepting money, was more expensive, eating,
                    drinking with me, and in addition I gave him Rochefort’s La Lanterne. But there
                    you are, a minor and unimportant problem compared with the fact that he posed
                    for it very well, <work origin="new" stage="planned">and that I also plan to
                        paint his newborn baby shortly.</work> Because his wife has just given
                    birth. At the same time as the drawings that I have on the go I’ll send you two
                    lithographs by De Lemud, ‘Wine’ and ‘Coffee’; in ‘Wine’ there’s a Mephisto
                    character who makes you think a little of C.M. when younger, and in Coffee —..
                    it’s absolutely Raoul — you know that perpetual old bohemian student type whom I
                    knew last year. What a talent, in the style of Hoffmann or Edgar Poe, this De
                    Lemud has. And yet there’s somebody who’s spoken of so rarely. You’ll perhaps
                    not like these lithographs very much at first glance — but it’s precisely when
                    looking at them longer that they grow on you. I have no more canvas or paint and
                    have already had to buy here. And I have to get even more. <stress
                        reason="money">So I beg you to send your letter so that I have it on
                        Saturday morning</stress>.</p>
                <p>Today I’m probably going to start on the interior of the café where I’m staying,
                    in the evening, by gaslight. It’s what they call a ‘night café’ here (they’re
                    quite common here), that stay open all night. This way the ‘night prowlers’ can
                    find a refuge when they don’t have the price of a lodging, or if they’re too
                    drunk to be admitted. All these things, family, native country, are perhaps more
                    appealing in the imagination of such as us — who do fairly well without a native
                    country, as well as a family — than in any reality. It always seems to me that
                    I’m a traveller who’s going somewhere and to a destination. If I say to myself,
                    the somewhere, the destination don’t exist at all, that seems well argued and
                    truthful to me. When he kicks somebody out, the brothel-keeper has a logic of
                    the same kind, argues well, too, and is always right. I know that. And at the
                    end of my career I’ll be wrong. So be it. Then I’ll find that not only the fine
                    arts but the rest as well were nothing but dreams, that we were nothing at all
                    ourselves. If we’re as lightweight as that, so much the better for us, as
                    nothing would then stand in the way of the limitless possibility of future
                    existence. Which is why in the present case of our uncle’s death, the dead man’s
                    face was tranquil, serene and grave. When it’s a fact that, while living, he was
                    scarcely like that, neither when young nor when old. So often I’ve noticed an
                    effect like that when looking at a dead man as if to question him. And that’s
                    one proof for me — not the most weighty — of an existence beyond the grave. And
                    a baby in its cradle, also, if you look at it at your ease, has the infinite in
                    its eyes. In fact, I know nothing about it, but precisely this feeling of not
                    knowing makes the real life that we’re living at present comparable to a simple
                    journey by train. You go fast, but you can’t distinguish any object very close
                    up, and above all, you can’t see the locomotive.</p>
                <p>It’s rather odd that our uncle, like our father, believed in the future life. Not
                    to mention our father, I’ve heard our uncle debating it several times. Ah — for
                    example, they were more certain than us, and asserted themselves, getting angry
                    if one dared go into it more deeply. I don’t see much of the future life of
                    artists through their works. Yes, artists perpetuate themselves, passing on the
                    torch, Delacroix to the Impressionists, &amp;c. But is that all? If a kind old
                    mother of a family, with pretty limited ideas that are tormented in the
                    Christian system, were immortal, just as she believes — and this seriously. And
                    I for one in no way deny it. Why should a consumptive or nervous cab-horse, like
                    Delacroix or De Goncourt, with broad ideas though, be any less so? Seeing that
                    it appears that it is precisely the most worn-out people who feel the germ of
                    this indefinable hope. That’s enough, what’s the use of worrying about it? But
                    living in the heart of civilization, in the heart of Paris and the heart of the
                    fine arts, why shouldn’t one keep this self of an old woman? If women
                    themselves, without their instinctive belief in an ‘it’s there’, wouldn’t find
                    the strength to create and to act? Then the doctors will tell us that not only
                    Moses, Mohammed, Christ, Luther, Bunyan and others were mad, but also Frans
                    Hals, Rembrandt, Delacroix and all the good, narrow-minded old ladies like our
                    mother as well. Ah — that’s serious, that is. We could ask these doctors, where,
                    then, are the sensible people? Are they, the brothel-keepers, always in the
                    right? It’s probable. What to choose, then? Fortunately we don’t have to
                    choose.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>I thank you very much for sending the canvas and the colours, which have just
                    arrived. This time there was carriage of 9.80 francs to pay, so I won’t go to
                    collect them until after I’ve received your next letter, <stress reason="money"
                        >as I don’t have the money at the moment.</stress> But we’ll have to check
                    whether Tasset, who in most cases pays postage and certainly then shows postage
                    on his invoice, hasn’t done so in this case. Also, I paid 5.60 francs for the
                    last consignment but one, and so if carriage charges are shown on the last
                    invoice but one, it would be too much. Now if he’d made 2 separate consignments
                    (the cost of carriage is usually about 3 francs), there should only be 5.60
                    francs to pay for this consignment. Provided I don’t paint anything on these 10
                    metres of canvas but masterpieces measuring half a metre, which I’ll sell for
                    cash and at an exorbitant price to the distinguished art lover of rue de la Paix
                    — nothing should be easier — than to earn a lot of money with this
                    consignment.</p>
                <p>I think it’s likely that we’re going to have great heat now, with no wind, the
                    wind having blown for 6 weeks. In that case, it’s excellent that I have colours
                    and canvases in stock, because I can already spot half a dozen subjects,
                    especially this little farmhouse garden of <work origin="existing"
                        stage="finished">which I sent you the drawing yesterday.</work> I think
                    about Gauguin a lot, and I assure you that one way or another, whether it’s he
                    who comes here, or I who go to him, he and I will both like more or less the
                    same subjects. I’ve no doubts about being able to work at Pont-Aven, and on the
                    other hand, am convinced that he’ll like this scenery here enormously. Ah well,
                    at the end of a year, even giving you one canvas a month, which will make a
                    dozen a year in all, he’ll still have made money, not having run up debts during
                    this year, and having produced without interruption he’ll lose nothing. While
                    the money that he’ll have received from us will be to a large extent recovered
                    through the savings that become possible if we live at home at the studio, he
                    and I, instead of living in cafés. The fact remains that provided we lived in
                    harmony and with an understanding not to quarrel, we’d gain a firmer position as
                    far as reputation goes. Each of us living alone, we live like madmen or
                    criminals, in appearance at least, and to some extent in reality, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <good_health>I’m happier to feel my old strength coming back than I would have
                        thought I could be.</good_health> I owe that largely to the people at the
                    restaurant where I eat these days, <unstress reason="environment">who are
                        extraordinary.</unstress> I have to pay there, of course, but it’s something
                    you don’t find in Paris, that they actually give you something to eat for your
                    money. And I’d very much like to see Gauguin there too, for a fair length of
                    time. What Gruby says — do without women and eat well — it’s true that does you
                    good, and if you spend your brains and your marrow working with your mind, it’s
                    very logical not to spend yourself making love any more than necessary. But
                    that’s easier to do in the country than in Paris. Is the desire for women that
                    one picks up in Paris not in part the effect of the malady of nervous exhaustion
                    itself, of which Gruby is the sworn enemy, rather than a sign of vigour? So one
                    sees this desire disappear at the very moment when one is recovering. The root
                    of the problem being found in our very constitution, in the inevitable weakening
                    of families from generation to generation, in our lousy profession as well, and
                    the sad Paris life; the root of the problem indeed lies there, and we seem
                    unable to cure ourselves of it. I believe that the day when you’d no longer have
                    to do idiotic accounting and ridiculously complicated administration at the
                    Goupils, you’ll gain a great deal in terms of power with art lovers; it’s a
                    thing cursed a thousand times, these complicated administrative tasks, and there
                    isn’t, I imagine, a single brain, a single clerk’s temperament that doesn’t lose
                    50% in them. In that, our uncle was quite right when he said: much work with few
                    staff, and not little work with many. Unfortunately for him, he got caught up in
                    the gear-wheels himself. Working among people, in order to sell, it’s a job that
                    requires observation, a cool head. But if one is forced to give too much
                    attention to the books, one loses self-confidence. That’s why Tersteeg was
                    fortunate to have that greedy swine Iterson at his side, who carries this
                    troublesome load of mechanical administration for him. I would really like to
                    know just how you are. Anyway, as long as the Impressionists produce fine
                    things, and find friends, there’s always a chance and possibility of a more
                    independent position for you later on. A pity that it can’t exist right now.</p>
                <p>Isn’t it true that in this business with Gauguin, with him spending 2.75 a day
                    (at least, I think I recall that he mentioned that amount, he or Bernard), we
                    know for a firm fact the price of a day at the hotel there, while here it still
                    remains to be seen. So at the price there we’re sure of being able to stay
                    within the limits proposed. About health, now; mine is basically even good
                    enough for the north, these days. Assumption, therefore, that he can’t find the
                    money; let’s not hesitate. In fact, we’re only tying ourselves up in this
                    business for a year, let’s say. Still no letter from Russell, but he’s bound to
                    reply, having doubtless received the drawings.</p>
                <p>This restaurant where I am is very odd, it’s grey all over, the floor is of grey
                    bitumen, like a pavement, grey paper on the wall. Green blinds, always closed. A
                    big green curtain in front of the ever-open door stops the dust coming in. It’s
                    altogether a Velázquez grey, as in women spinning. Not even the very narrow and
                    very violent shaft of sunlight through a blind, like the one that falls across
                    V’s painting, is missing. Of course, small tables with white cloths. Now behind
                    this Velázquez-grey room you can see the old kitchen, clean as a Dutch kitchen;
                    very red brick floor, green vegetables, oak cupboard, cooking- stoves with
                    gleaming copperware, with blue and white tiles and the big, bright orange fire.
                    Now there are two women who serve, also in grey, more or less like the painting
                    by Prévost that you have at home, really comparable in every respect. In the
                    kitchen, an old woman and a short, fat, serving-woman, also in grey, black,
                    white. I don’t know if I’m describing it clearly enough, but that’s what I’ve
                    seen here of real Velázquez. In front of the restaurant, a covered courtyard,
                    paved with red bricks, and on the walls, vines growing wild, convolvulus and
                    climbing plants. It’s still the real old Provence style, while the other
                    restaurants are so much on Paris lines that even though there’s no concierge of
                    any sort there’s still her lodge, and the notice, ‘speak to the concierge’. So
                    not everything is brilliantly coloured all the time. For example, I saw a
                    cowshed with 4 cows the colour of café au lait, and a calf the same colour, the
                    cowshed a blue white, covered in cobwebs, the cows very clean and very
                    beautiful, a big green curtain, against dust and flies, in the outside door.
                    Grey too, Velázquez grey. There was a tranquillity about it — this café au lait
                    and tobacco brown of the cows’ hides, with the soft white bluish grey of the
                    walls, the green curtain and the yellow and sparkling green of the sunny
                    exterior making a brilliant contrast. You see how there are other things still
                    to do, quite different from what I’ve done. I have to go to work. <unstress
                        reason="environment">I saw another very tranquil and quite beautiful thing
                        the other day,</unstress> a young girl with a café au lait complexion — if I
                    remember rightly — ash-blonde hair, grey eyes. Bodice of pale printed calico,
                    under which you could see her high, firm little breasts. This against the
                    emerald foliage of the fig trees. A real countrywoman, a great virginal look.
                    Not completely impossible that I might have her pose in the open air, and her
                    mother as well — a gardener — colour of earth, who was thus dirty yellow and
                    faded blue. The young girl’s café au lait complexion was darker than the pink of
                    her bodice. The mother was marvellous, her dirty yellow and faded blue figure
                    stood out in the full sun against a brilliant square of snow-white and
                    lemon-yellow flowers. A real Vermeer of Delft, then. <unstress

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Would you ask Tasset his opinion on the following question? It seems to me that
                    the more finely a colour is ground, the more it is saturated by oil. Now we’re
                    not over-fond of oil, that goes without saying. If we painted like Monsieur
                    Gérôme and the other trompe-l’oeil photographic ones, we’d no doubt ask for
                    colours ground very fine. We, on the contrary, don’t strongly object to the
                    canvas having a rough look. So if instead of having the colour ground on the
                    stone for God knows how many hours, we grind it just long enough to make it
                    workable, without bothering too much about the fineness of the grain, we’d have
                    colours that were fresher, perhaps darkening less. If he wishes to do a test
                    with the 3 chromes, Veronese, vermilion, orange lead, cobalt, ultramarine, I’m
                    almost certain that at greatly reduced cost I would have colours that were both
                    fresher and longer-lasting. At what price, then? I’m sure that could be done.
                    Probably for the reds, for emerald, which are transparent, too.</p>
                <p>I add here an order that’s urgent. <work origin="new" stage="middle">I’m now on
                        the fourth painting of sunflowers.</work> This fourth one is a bouquet of 14
                    flowers and is on a yellow background, like a still life of quinces and lemons
                    that I did back then. Only as it’s much bigger, this one creates quite an
                    unusual effect, and I believe that this time it’s painted with more simplicity
                    than the quinces and lemons. Do you remember that one day at the Hôtel Drouot we
                    saw a quite extraordinary Manet, some large pink peonies and their green leaves
                    on a light background? As much in harmony and as much a flower as anything you
                    like, and yet painted in solid, thick impasto and not like Jeannin. That’s what
                    I’d call simplicity of technique. And I must tell you that these days I’m making
                    a great effort to find a way of using the brush without stippling or anything
                    else, nothing but a varied brushstroke. But you’ll see, one day. What a pity
                    painting costs so much. <unstress reason="money">This week I had fewer money
                        worries than other weeks,</unstress> so I let myself go. I’ll have spent the
                    hundred-franc note in a single week, but at the end of this week I’ll have my
                    four paintings and even if I add the price of all the colours that I’ve used up,
                    the week won’t have been wasted. I got up very early every day, I dined and
                    supped well, I was able to work assiduously without feeling myself weaken. But
                    there you are, we live in times when there’s no market for what we do; not only
                    do we not sell, as you see with Gauguin, we’d like to borrow against paintings
                    done and we find nothing, even when the amounts are insignificant and the works
                    substantial. And that’s how we fall prey to all the whims of fortune. And I fear
                    that it will scarcely change during our lifetime. As long as we were preparing
                    the way for richer lives for the painters who will walk in our footsteps, that
                    would already be something. Life is short, though, and especially the number of
                    years when one feels strong enough to brave everything. And in the end, there’s
                    the fear that as soon as the new painting is appreciated, the painters will
                    weaken.</p>
                <p>In any case, here’s what’s positive, we aren’t the ones who represent decadence
                    today. Gauguin and Bernard are now talking about doing ‘children’s painting’. I
                    prefer that to the painting of the decadents. How does it come about that people
                    see something decadent in Impressionism? It’s actually quite the reverse. I
                    enclose a line for Tasset. The difference in price should be quite considerable,
                    and it goes without saying that I hope to use fewer and fewer finely ground
                    colours. I shake your hand firmly. (One of the decorations of sunflowers on a
                    royal blue background has a ‘halo’, that’s to say, each object is surrounded by
                    a line of the colour complementary to the background against which it stands
                    out).</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Many thanks for your letter and for the 50-franc note it contained. Certainly, it
                    isn’t impossible that our sister will come later and live with us. It’s a good
                    sign as far as her taste goes that she likes sculpture; that really did please
                    me. Painting as it is now promises to become more subtle — more music and less
                    sculpture — in fact, it promises colour. As long as it keeps this promise. <work
                        origin="existing" stage="middle">The sunflowers are progressing; there’s a
                        new bouquet of 14 flowers on a green-yellow background, so it’s exactly the
                        same effect — but in larger format,</work> no. 30 canvas — as a still life
                    of quinces and lemons that you already have, but in the sunflowers the painting
                    is much simpler.</p>
                <p>Do you remember that one day at the Hôtel Drouot we saw a bouquet of peonies by
                    Manet? Pink flowers, very green leaves, painted in thick impasto and not glazed,
                    like Jeannin’s. Standing out against a simple white background, I believe. Now
                    there’s something that was really healthy. As for stippling, making halos or
                    other things, I find that a real discovery, but it can already be foreseen that
                    this technique won’t become a universal dogma any more than another. Another
                    reason why Seurat’s La Grande Jatte, Signac’s landscapes with coarse stippling,
                    Anquetin’s boat, will in time become even more personal, even more original.</p>
                <p>As far as my clothes are concerned, they were certainly starting to suffer — but
                    only last week I bought a black velvet jacket of quite good quality for 20
                    francs, and a new hat, so that’s not at all urgent. <work origin="new"
                        stage="finished">But I consulted this postman whom I painted,</work> who has
                    very often set up his little household and dismantled it again, moving house for
                    roughly the price of the indispensable pieces of furniture, and he says that
                    here you can’t get a good bed that will last, for less than 150 francs, if you
                    want to have something solid, of course. However, that hardly upsets the
                    calculation that by saving the money for lodgings, at the end of a year you find
                    you own furniture without having spent any more during the year. And as soon as
                    I’m able, I won’t hesitate to do that. If we were to refrain from setting
                    ourselves up like that, Gauguin and I could drag on from year to year in small
                    lodgings where one can’t fail to become dull-witted. I’m more or less that way
                    already, because it goes back a long, long way. <stress reason="environment">And
                        at present that has even ceased to be a source of pain, and perhaps at first
                        I won’t feel at home in my own home.</stress> Never mind.</p>
                <p>However, let’s not forget Bouvard et Pécuchet, let’s not forget À vau l’eau,
                    because all of that is very, very profoundly true. Au bonheur des dames and
                    Bel-ami, that’s no less true, however. It’s ways of seeing things — now, with
                    the first one, we’re less in danger of behaving like Don Quixote; it’s possible,
                    and with the last idea we go the whole hog. Now I have the old peasant again
                    this week. Ah — Macknight has cleared off at last — I don’t regret it in the
                    least. His pal the Belgian didn’t seem greatly saddened by it either when he
                    came yesterday to tell me about it, and we spent the evening together. He’s very
                    reasonable in his ideas, and knows what he wants, at least. At the moment he’s
                    doing timid Impressionism, but very much by the rules, very exact. And I told
                    him that it was the best thing he could do, although he would lose 2 years on it
                    perhaps, delaying his originality, but after all, I told him, it’s as necessary
                    now to pass through Impressionism properly as it once was to go through a Paris
                    studio. He accepted that absolutely in its entirety, precisely because that way
                    you shock nobody, and you can’t later be accused of not being abreast of things.
                    He’s thinking seriously of going to paint the coal-miners in the Borinage, and
                    if he’s still here when Gauguin comes, not impossible then that we’ll ask him to
                    do for us in the north what we’d do for him in the south — do our utmost to
                    enable him to live more cheaply than on his own.</p>

                    pretend to represent a red sunset in trompe l’oeil, is perhaps a suggestion of
                    it, all the same. Unfortunately, I fear that the little Arlésienne will stand me
                    up for the rest of the painting. The last time she came she had innocently asked
                    for the money in advance that I’d promised her for all the sittings, and as I
                    made no difficulty about that she scarpered without my seeing her again. Anyway,
                    one of these days she owes it to me to come back, and it would be a bit rich if
                    she didn’t turn up at all. I have a bouquet on the go as well, and also a still
                    life of a pair of old shoes. </p>
                <p>I have a mass of ideas for my work, and by continuing the figure very
                    assiduously, I’d possibly find something new. But what can you do, sometimes I
                    feel too weak in the face of the given circumstances, and I’d have to be wiser
                    and richer and younger to win the fight. Fortunately for me, I no longer count
                    at all on any victory, and in painting I look for nothing more than the means of
                    getting by in life.</p>
                <p>I’ve still had no reply whatsoever from Russell. He probably doesn’t have a sou
                    at the moment. I really hope that our sister will also have seen the Luxembourg
                    by now. We’ve had two or three glorious days here, very hot, with no wind. The
                    grapes are beginning to ripen, but you hear people saying they won’t be good.
                        <work origin="new" stage="planned">I must do some more work today.</work>
                    Because of the models, I’m dreading these last days of the week a little. I’m
                    still negotiating with some other people about posing; there’s something that’s
                    urging me always to do as many figure studies as possible. Circumstances could
                    get even worse in future, and well, whatever the case may be, once I’ve mastered
                    the figure, work will seem more serious to me.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>A line in haste to thank you very, very much indeed for the prompt dispatch of
                    your letter. In fact, my chap had already come first thing this morning for his
                    rent. Of course, I had to make my decision known today whether or not I’d keep
                    the house on (because I rented it until Michaelmas, and you have to renew or
                    withdraw beforehand). I told my chap that I’d take it on again for 3 months
                    only, or preferably by the month. That way, supposing that our friend Gauguin
                    arrived, we wouldn’t have a very long lease ahead of us should he not like it.
                        <stress reason="friendship">Far too often I become thoroughly discouraged,
                        thinking about what Gauguin will say about this part of the country in the
                        long run.</stress>
                    <stress reason="environment">Isolation here is quite considerable,</stress> and
                    while paying, you have to hack each step out of the ice in order just to get
                    from one day’s work to the same the next day. The difficulty about models is
                    there, but patience, and especially always having a few sous, can help there, of
                    course. But this difficulty is real. I feel that even at the present time I
                    could be an entirely different painter if I was able to settle the question of
                    models.</p>
                <p>But I also feel the possibility of getting dull-witted and of seeing the time of
                    potency in artistic production disappearing, just as in the course of life our
                    balls start to let us down. That’s inevitable, and of course, here as there it’s
                    self-confidence and striking while the iron’s hot that’s pressing.
                        <bad_health>And so I very often feel despondent.</bad_health> But Gauguin
                    and so many others are in exactly the same position, and we must above all look
                    for the remedy within ourselves, in good will and patience. By being content to
                    be no more than mediocrities. Acting like that, perhaps we’ll open up a new
                    path.</p>
                <p>I’m very curious to receive your next letter, reporting more fully on your visit
                    to Bing. It doesn’t surprise me that you say that after our sister’s departure
                    you’ll feel an empty gap. You must above all try to fill it. And what could
                    there be against Gauguin’s coming to live with you? That way he could satisfy
                    himself on the subject of Paris while working at the same time. But in that case
                    it would only be fair that he should also reimburse you in paintings for what
                    you would do for him. <stress reason="environment">For me, it’s a constant
                        sorrow to do so comparatively little with the money I spend. My life is
                        restless and anxious,</stress> but then, moving house and moving around a
                    lot, perhaps I would only make things worse. It makes enormous trouble for me
                    that I don’t speak the Provençal patois.</p>
                <p>I’m still thinking very seriously about using coarser colours, which would be no
                    less solid for being less finely ground. At present I often stop myself when
                    planning a painting, <stress reason="money">because of the paint it costs
                        us.</stress> Now, that’s rather a pity, all the same, for this good reason,
                    that perhaps we have the power to work today, but we don’t know if it’ll still
                    be there tomorrow. All the same, rather than losing physical strength, I’m
                    regaining it, and my stomach, especially, is stronger.</p>
                <p>I’m sending you 3 volumes of Balzac today; it’s really a bit old, etc., but the
                    work of Daumier and De Lemud is no uglier for belonging to a period that doesn’t
                    exist any more. At the moment, I’m at last reading Daudet’s L’immortel, which I
                    find very beautiful but hardly consoling. I believe that I’ll have to read a
                    book about elephant hunting, or a totally mendacious book of categorically
                    impossible adventures, by Gustave Aimard for example, in order to get over the
                    heartbreak that L’immortel will leave in me. Particularly because it’s so
                    beautiful and so true, in making one feel the emptiness of the civilized world.
                    I must say that for real power I prefer his Tartarin though.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Thank you a thousand times for your kind letter and the 300 francs it contained —
                        <unstress reason="environment">after some weeks of worries I’ve just had a
                        much better one.</unstress> And just as worries don’t come singly, nor do
                    joys, either. Because actually, always bowed down under this money problem with
                    lodging-house keepers, I put up with it cheerfully. I’d given a piece of my mind
                    to the said lodging-house keeper, who isn’t a bad man after all, and I’d told
                    him that to get my own back on him for having paid him so much money for
                    nothing, I’d paint his whole filthy old place as a way of getting my money back.
                    Well, to the great delight of the lodging-house keeper, the postman whom I’ve
                    already painted, the prowling night-visitors and myself, <work origin="new"
                        stage="finished">for 3 nights I stayed up to paint, going to bed during the
                        day.</work> It often seems to me that the night is much more alive and
                    richly coloured than the day.</p>
                <p>Now as for recovering the money paid to the landlord through my painting, I’m not
                    making a point of it, because the painting is one of the ugliest I’ve done. It’s
                    the equivalent, though different, of the potato eaters. I’ve tried to express
                    the terrible human passions with the red and the green. The room is blood-red
                    and dull yellow, a green billiard table in the centre, 4 lemon yellow lamps with
                    an orange and green glow. Everywhere it’s a battle and an antithesis of the most
                    different greens and reds; in the characters of the sleeping ruffians, small in
                    the empty, high room, some purple and blue. The blood-red and the yellow-green
                    of the billiard table, for example, contrast with the little bit of delicate
                    Louis XV green of the counter, where there’s a pink bouquet. The white clothes
                    of the owner, watching over things from a corner in this furnace, become lemon
                    yellow, pale luminous green. <work origin="new" stage="planned">I’m making a
                        drawing of it in watercolour tones to send you tomorrow, to give you an idea
                        of it.</work>
                </p>
                <p>I’ve written to Gauguin and to Bernard this week, but I didn’t talk about
                    anything but paintings, just so as not to quarrel, when there’s probably no
                    reason to. But whether or not Gauguin comes, if I buy furniture, then we have,
                    in a good place or a bad, that’s another question — a pied-à-terre, a home that
                    lifts from the mind this melancholy of being on the street. Which is nothing
                    when you’re a 20-year-old adventurer, <stress reason="money">but which is bad
                        when you’ve turned 35. </stress>I see in L’Intransigeant today the suicide
                    of Mr Bing Lévy. Not possible, is it, that that could be Bing’s manager, Lévy??
                    I think it must be somebody else. It gives me great pleasure that Pissarro found
                    something in the young girl.</p>
                <p>Did Pissarro say anything about the sower? Later on, when I’ve taken those
                    experiments further, the sower will still be the first attempt in that genre.
                    The night café is a continuation of the sower, as is the head of the old peasant
                    and of the poet, if I manage to do the latter painting. It’s a colour, then,
                    that isn’t locally true from the realist point of view of trompe l’oeil, but a
                    colour suggesting some emotion, an ardent temperament. When Paul Mantz saw
                    Delacroix’s violent and exalted sketch, Christ’s boat, at the exhibition that we
                    saw in the Champs-Elysées, he turned away from it and cried out in his article,
                    ‘I did not know that one could be so terrifying with blue and green’. Hokusai
                    makes you cry out the same thing — but in his case with his lines, his drawing,
                    since in your letter you say to yourself: these waves are claws, the boat is
                    caught in them, you can feel it. Ah well, if we made the colour very correct or
                    the drawing very correct, we wouldn’t create those emotions. Anyway, soon —
                    tomorrow or the day after — I’ll write to you again on this subject and will
                    reply to your letter, <work origin="new" stage="sketch">sending you croquis of
                        the night café</work>. Tasset’s consignment has arrived; I’ll write to you
                    tomorrow on the subject of this coarse paint.</p>
                <p>Milliet will come to say hello to you one of these days; he writes me that he’s
                    going to come back. Thank you once again for the money sent. If I was first
                    going to look for another place, isn’t it likely that then there would be new
                    expenses in that, at least equivalent to the costs of moving? And moreover,
                    would I find better right away? I’m very glad indeed to be able to furnish my
                    house, and that can only help me get on. </p>
            </body>
            <close>So many thanks and good handshake; till tomorrow.</close>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>I’ve just put <work origin="new" stage="sketch">the croquis</work> of <work
                        origin="new" stage="finished">the new painting, the ‘Night café’,</work> in
                    the post — <work origin="existing" stage="finished">as well as another one that
                        I did some time ago.</work> I’ll perhaps end up making some Japanese prints.
                    Now yesterday I worked at furnishing the house. Just as the postman and his wife
                    told me, the two beds, if you want something sturdy, will come to 150 francs
                    each. I found that everything they’d told me about prices was true. As a result
                    I had to change tack, and this is what I did: I bought one bed in walnut and
                    another in deal, which will be mine, and which I’ll paint later. Then I bought
                    linen for one of the beds, and I bought two palliasses. If Gauguin or somebody
                    else were to come, there you are, his bed will be made in a minute. From the
                    start, I wanted to arrange the house not just for myself but in such a way as to
                    be able to put somebody up. Naturally, that ate up most of my money. With what
                    was left, I bought 12 chairs, a mirror, and some small indispensable things.
                    Which in short means that next week I’ll be able to go and live there. For
                    putting somebody up, <unstress reason="environment">there’ll be the prettiest
                        room upstairs, which I’ll try to make as nice as possible, like a woman’s
                        boudoir, really artistic.</unstress> Then there’ll be my own bedroom, which
                    I’d like to be exceedingly simple, but the furniture square and broad. The bed,
                    the chairs, table, all in deal. Downstairs, the studio and another room, also a
                    studio, but a kitchen at the same time. One of these days you’ll see a painting
                    of the little house itself, in full sunshine or else with the window lit and the
                    starry sky. Then you’ll be able to believe you own your country house here in
                    Arles. Because I myself am enthusiastic about the idea of arranging it in such a
                    way that you’ll like it, and that it’ll be a studio in a style absolutely meant
                    to be that way. </p>
                <p>Let’s say that in a year you come to spend a holiday here and in Marseille, it
                    will be ready then — <unstress reason="environment">and the way I envisage it,
                        the house will be just full of paintings from top to bottom.</unstress> The
                    room where you’ll stay then, or which will be Gauguin’s if Gauguin comes, will
                    have a decoration of large yellow sunflowers on its white walls. Opening the
                    window in the morning, you see the greenery in the gardens and the rising sun
                    and the entrance of the town. But you’ll see these big paintings of bouquets of
                    12, 14 sunflowers stuffed into this tiny little boudoir with a pretty bed and
                    everything else elegant. It won’t be commonplace. And the studio — the red
                    floor-tiles, the white walls and ceiling, the rustic chairs, the deal table,
                    with, I hope, decoration of portraits. That will have character à la Daumier —
                    and it won’t, I dare predict, be commonplace.</p>
                <p>Now I’m going to ask you to look for some Daumier lithographs for the studio, and
                    some Japanese prints, but it’s not at all urgent, and only when you find
                    duplicates of them. And some Delacroixs too, ordinary lithographs by modern
                    artists. It’s not the least little bit urgent, but I have my idea. I really want
                    to make of it — an artist’s house but not precious, on the contrary, nothing
                    precious, but everything from the chair to the painting having character. So for
                    the beds I bought local beds, two wide double beds, instead of iron beds. It
                    gives a look of solidity, durability, calm, and if it takes a bit more
                    bed-linen, that’s too bad, but it must have character. Most fortunately I have a
                    charwoman who’s very loyal; without that I wouldn’t dare begin the business of
                    living in my own place. She’s quite old and has a mixed bunch of kids, and she
                    keeps my tiles nice and red and clean. <unstress reason="career">I wouldn’t be
                        able to explain to you how pleased I am to find a big, serious job this
                        way.</unstress> Because I hope it’ll be a true decoration that I’m going to
                    undertake there. <work origin="new" stage="planned">So, as I’ve already told
                        you, I’m going to paint my own bed, there’ll be 3 subjects.</work> Perhaps a
                    naked woman, I haven’t decided, perhaps a cradle with a child; I don’t know, but
                    I’ll take my time. I now no longer feel any hesitation about staying here,
                    because ideas for work are coming to me in abundance. I now plan to buy some
                    article for the house every month. And with patience, the house will be worth
                    something for the furniture and the decorations.</p>
                <p>I must warn you that very shortly I’ll need a big order for colours for the
                    autumn, which I believe is going to be absolutely marvellous. And on reflection,
                    I’ll send you the order enclosed herewith. In my painting of the night café I’ve
                    tried to express the idea that the café is a place where you can ruin yourself,
                    go mad, commit crimes. Anyway, I tried with contrasts of delicate pink and
                    blood-red and wine-red. Soft Louis XV and Veronese green contrasting with yellow
                    greens and hard blue greens. All of that in an ambience of a hellish furnace, in
                    pale sulphur. To express something of the power of the dark corners of a
                    grog-shop. And yet with the appearance of Japanese gaiety and Tartarin’s good
                    nature. But what would Mr Tersteeg say about this painting? He who, looking at a
                    Sisley — Sisley, the most tactful and sensitive of the Impressionists — had
                    already said: ‘I can’t stop myself thinking that the artist who painted that was
                    a little tipsy’. Looking at my painting, then, he’d say that it’s a full-blown
                    case of delirium tremens. I find absolutely nothing to object to what you speak
                    of, to exhibit sometime at the Revue Indépendante, as long as I’m not a cause of
                    obstruction for the others who usually exhibit there. Only we’d then have to
                    tell them that I’d like to reserve a second exhibition for myself, after this
                    first one of what are in fact studies. Then next year I’d give them the
                    decoration of the house to exhibit, when there would be an ensemble. Not that I
                    insist, but it’s so that the studies shouldn’t be confused with compositions,
                    and to say beforehand that the first exhibition would be one of studies. Because
                    there’s still hardly more than the sower and the night café that are attempts at
                    composed paintings.</p>
                <p>As I write, the little peasant who looks like a caricature of our father is just
                    coming into the café. The resemblance is amazing, all the same. The receding
                    profile and the weariness and the ill-defined mouth, especially. It continues to
                    seem a pity to me that I haven’t been able to do him. I’m adding to this letter
                    the order for colours, which isn’t exactly urgent. Only I’m so full of plans,
                    and then the autumn promises so many superb subjects that I simply don’t know if
                    I’m going to start 5 or 10 canvases. It’ll be the same thing as in the spring,
                    with the orchards in blossom, the subjects will be innumerable. If you gave père
                    Tanguy the coarser paint, he’d probably do that well. His other fine colours are
                    really inferior, especially for the blues. I hope, when preparing the next
                    consignment, to gain a little in quality. I’m doing comparatively less, and
                    coming back to it longer. I’ve kept back 50 francs for the week; thus there has
                    already been 250 for the furniture. And I’ll recoup them anyway, doing it this
                    way. And from today you can say to yourself that you have a sort of country
                    house, unfortunately a bit far away. But it would cease to be very, very far if
                    we had a permanent exhibition in Marseille. We’ll see that in a year, perhaps.

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Enclosed herewith letter from Gauguin, which arrived at the same time as a letter
                    from Bernard. <stress reason="money">At last, it’s the cry of distress.... my
                        debt is increasing from day to day.</stress> I won’t dwell on what he has to
                    do. You offer him hospitality here, and you accept the only means of payment he
                    has, his paintings. But if in addition to and apart from that, he demanded that
                    you pay for his journey, he’s going a bit far, and at least he should very
                    openly offer you some of his paintings, and appeal to you as well as to me in
                    terms less vague than ‘my debt increasing from day to day, my journey is
                    becoming more and more unlikely’. He would have a better sense of things if he
                    said, I prefer to leave all my paintings in your hands, because you’re kind to
                    me, and to run up debts with you, who are fond of me, rather than living with my
                    landlord. But he has a stomach-ache, and when you have a stomach-ache, you don’t
                    have free will.</p>
                <p>Now I don’t have a stomach-ache, at present. <good_health>And as a result I feel
                        my head freer, and I should hope more lucid.</good_health> I find it
                    absolutely unfair that you, who’ve just sent the money that you yourself have
                    had to borrow for furnishing the house, should also have to bear the expense of
                    the journey, and especially when this journey is complicated by the payment of
                    the debt. Unless Gauguin, sharing absolutely everything, were to give you the
                    whole of his work. In such a way that, ceasing to keep count, we’d share
                    absolutely everything. If we shared expenses and made common cause, I myself
                    believe that everyone would profit from it after some years’ working in common.
                    Because, if the association is created under these conditions, you will feel, I
                    don’t say happier, but more of an artist and more productive than with me alone.
                    For him, as for me, we’ll feel very clearly that we must succeed, because the
                    honour of all three of us is involved there, and because we’re not working just
                    for ourselves. That seems to me to be the case. And I say to myself that even if
                    we must tumble into the inevitability of things, we should still do it that way. </p>
                <p>But increasingly I’m dismissing the idea of that tumble when I think of the
                    serenity that we see on faces in Frans Halses and Rembrandts, as in the portrait
                    of old Six, as in his own, as in those Frans Halses that we know so well in
                    Haarlem, of old men and old women.It’s better to have serenity than to be too
                    fearful. Why, then, make such a noise on the subject of this affair with
                    Gauguin? If he comes with the two of us he’ll do well, and we really want him to
                    come. But neither he nor we should be crushed. Anyway, there’s a beautiful calm
                    in his letter all the same. Although he leaves his intentions towards us
                    unexplained. But if we wish to do this thing well, it will require loyalty on
                    his part. I’m quite curious to know what he’ll write to you himself; I’ll reply
                    to him exactly as I feel, but I don’t want to say melancholy or sad or mean
                    things to so great an artist. But from the point of view of money, the affair is
                    taking on serious proportions; there’s the journey, there’s the debt, and
                    there’s the fact that the furnishing isn’t complete. Only it’s already complete
                    enough that if Gauguin were to drop in here unexpectedly there would be a way to
                    manage while waiting to get our breath back. Gauguin is married, and it’s very
                    important to be aware beforehand that in the long run it’s not certain that
                    different interests will be compatible. Now that’s why, in the case of some sort
                    of association, we have to have the conditions settled well and clearly,
                    precisely so that we don’t fall out later. If all goes well for Gauguin, you’ll
                    see at this point that he’ll go back to his wife and children. Certainly I’d
                    wish that for him. Ah well, we must therefore have more confidence in the value
                    of his paintings than his landlord does, but he mustn’t calculate them to be so
                    expensive to you that instead of your having some benefit from the association,
                    you’d have nothing but responsibilities and costs. That must not be, and anyway,
                    will not be. But you must have from him the best of what he has.</p>
                <p>I must warn you that I plan to keep several studies here at the studio, instead
                    of sending them to you. I believe that if I very firmly continue this project of
                    turning the house here into something that’s a little bit truly artistic, later
                    on you’ll have a series of studies that will hold together. Russell replied, by
                    the way — negatively as far as buying a Gauguin is concerned, but he invites me
                    to spend some time with him, which would start and finish with costing the money
                    for the journey. I’m not saying, though, that he won’t buy a Gauguin, because he
                    himself will feel that he’s not being very helpful at present. But after all, by
                    building himself a house, as long as he puts people up there, he’s doing the
                    very thing that’s needed from the moment our landlords kick us out.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>When Gauguin comes to work with me, and when for his part he shows himself a
                    little bit generous as far as his paintings are concerned — Well, then, won’t
                    you then give work to two artists who without you would have nothing to do, and
                    at the same time admitting that I believe you to be completely in the right when
                    you say that as far as money’s concerned, you see no advantage in it. From
                    another point of view you’ll be doing something like Durand-Ruel, who in the
                    past, before other people recognized Claude Monet’s individuality, bought
                    paintings from him. And Durand-Ruel didn’t earn from it either; at one point he
                    had quantities of those paintings without being able to dispose of them. But
                    after all, what he did will always remain well done, and today he can always say
                    to himself that he won his case. If I saw a financial disadvantage, however, I
                    wouldn’t mention it myself. But Gauguin will have to be loyal, but seeing that
                    the arrival of his friend Laval has opened up another resource for him for the
                    time being, I believe he’s hesitating between Laval and us. I don’t blame him
                    for it; only if G. doesn’t lose sight of his interest, it’s only right that you
                    don’t lose sight of yours from the point of view of repayment in paintings. We
                    can already see that Gauguin would have ditched us completely by now if Laval
                    had had a sou or two. I’m very curious to know what he’ll say to you in his next
                    letter, which you’ll certainly have before long. There you have it, I’m sure
                    that whether he comes or not, our friendship with him will endure, <stress
                        reason="friendship">but that we must show a little firmness on our
                        side.</stress> He won’t find anything better, unless it was precisely by
                    taking advantage of what you’ve wished to do for him. Now, that he won’t dare to
                    do. You should just know that if I don’t see him come I won’t be the least bit
                    upset about it and that I won’t work any the less because of it; that if he
                    comes he’ll be very welcome. But I can see so clearly that counting on him would
                    be just what would do us in. He’ll be loyal if it’s to his advantage, now if he
                    doesn’t come he’ll find something else, but he won’t find anything better and
                    he’ll lose nothing by not trying to be clever.</p>
                <p>I’ll need another 5 metres of ordinary canvas at 2.50 francs, but it goes without
                    saying that Tasset, taking the weight of this package into account, should send
                    either a metre more or a metre less, so that the carriage isn’t double. I
                    believe that now it’s a good opportunity for you to ask Gauguin bluntly when he
                    writes to you, are you coming or are you not coming? If you haven’t made up your
                    mind, on neither side will we be bound to do the thing envisaged. If the plan
                    for a more serious association isn’t to come about, no matter, but then each
                    person must regain his freedom of action. My letter to Gauguin has gone off; I
                    asked them for an exchange if they wish; I would so much like to have here
                    Gauguin’s portrait of Bernard and Bernard’s of Gauguin. Included herewith an
                    article that will interest you; you’d be well advised to go to see that. Ideas
                    for work are coming to me in abundance, and that means that even though isolated
                        <stress reason="environment">I don’t have time to think or to feel.</stress>
                    I’m going like a painting-locomotive. Now I believe that this is never going to
                    stop. And my idea is that a living studio, you’ll never find one ready-made, but
                    it’s created from one day to the next through work and staying patiently in the
                    same place. <work origin="existing" stage="finished">I have a study of an old
                        mill, painted in broken tones like the Oak on the rock;</work> that study
                    which you said you had framed with the sower. The idea of the sower still
                    continues to haunt me. Exaggerated studies like the sower, like the night café
                    now, usually seem to me atrociously ugly and bad, but when I’m moved by
                    something, as here by this little article on Dostoevsky, then they’re the only
                    ones that seem to me to have a more important meaning. <work origin="new"
                        stage="finished">I have a third study now, of a landscape with factory, and
                        an enormous sun in a red sky, above red roofs, </work>in which nature seems
                    to be in a rage, on a day of nasty mistral.</p>
                <p>As far as the house is concerned, <unstress reason="environment">the fact that it
                        will be habitable continues to soothe me very much.</unstress> Will my work
                    be worse because by staying in the same place I’ll see the seasons come and go
                    on the same subjects? Seeing the same orchards again in spring, the same
                    wheatfields in summer, I’ll inevitably see my work regularly before me in
                    advance, and can plan better. And by keeping certain studies here to make an
                    ensemble that will hold together, after a certain time that will make a calmer
                    body of work for you. I feel that as far as that goes, we’re pretty well on the
                    right road. I could only wish that you were nearer here. Considering that I
                    can’t bring the north closer to the south, what’s to be done? So I say to myself
                    that on my own I’m not capable of doing sufficiently important painting to
                    justify your travelling to the south two or three times a year. But — if Gauguin
                    came and if it was fairly well known that we were living here and helping
                    artists to live and work, I still don’t see the impossibility of the south’s
                    becoming for you, as for me, a second native country in some sense. I’m very
                    pleased to have finished my letter to Gauguin without saying that it bewilders
                    me somewhat that he should hesitate between going to stay with Laval or with me.
                    It would be unfair not to leave him total freedom to choose and to do as he can.
                    But I wrote to him that I was sure that even if he didn’t come here because the
                    journey wouldn’t be possible for him, then he wouldn’t be staying much longer at
                    a hotel. And that then it was two permanent studios instead of one. I always
                    come back to this, that once settled one works more calmly. And in that position
                    one can always be of more help to others, too, if the opportunity arises.
                    Bernard says that it makes him suffer to see how Gauguin is often prevented from
                    doing what he can, after all, by purely material questions of paint, canvas,
                    &amp;c. But in any case, that won’t continue. Wouldn’t the worst thing that
                    could happen to him be that he’d be forced to leave his paintings with his
                    landlord as security for his debt, and to take refuge either with you or with
                    me, travelling one way? But in that case, if he didn’t wish to lose his
                    paintings, he must confront his landlord quite directly. A case like that, where
                    the merchandise is in any case worth considerably more than the debt, can be
                    heard as a matter of urgency by the president of the district civil court. If
                    the landlord claims the right to keep everything, which he has no right to.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo, </salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Many thanks for your letter and for the 50-franc note it contained. I’ve also
                    received Maurin’s drawing, which is superb. That man’s a great artist. Last
                    night I slept in the house, and although there are still things to be done,
                        <good_health>I feel very happy there.</good_health> Besides, I feel that I
                    can make something of it that will last, and from which someone else will also
                    be able to benefit. Now money spent will no longer be money wasted, and I
                    believe it won’t be long before you see the difference there. At present it
                    makes me think of Bosboom’s interiors, with the red tiles, the white walls, the
                    furniture in deal or walnut, the patches of intense blue sky and greenery
                    visible through the windows. Now the surroundings, with the public garden, the
                    night cafés, the grocer’s shop, aren’t Millet, of course, but failing that, it’s
                    pure Daumier, pure Zola. Now that’s quite enough to find ideas in, isn’t it? </p>
                <p> I already wrote to you yesterday that, if I count the two beds at 300 francs,
                    the price can’t be reduced any further. If, however, I’ve already bought more
                    than that, it’s because, if I already put half of last week’s money into it,
                    yesterday I had to pay another 10 francs to the lodging-house keeper and 30
                    francs for a palliasse. At the moment I have 5 francs left in my pocket. So I’m
                    going to ask you to send me another louis, depending on what you can manage —
                    but by return of post — to see me through the week, or 50 francs, if it’s
                    possible. One way or another, this month I’d like to be able to count on
                    receiving 100 instead of 50, again, over the whole month, as I asked you in my
                    letter yesterday. If I save 50 francs over the month myself, if I add to that
                    the other 50, it means that in total I’ll have spent 400 francs on furniture.
                        <unstress reason="environment">My dear Theo, here we are, at last, more on
                        the right road!</unstress> It’s true that it doesn’t matter not having
                    hearth nor home as long as you’re young, and living like a traveller, in cafés,
                    but that was becoming intolerable to me now, and most of all, it wasn’t
                    compatible with thoughtful work. So my plan is all worked out. I’ll try to do
                    painting for what you send me every month, and then I want to do painting for
                    the house. What I do for the house will be to reimburse you for previous
                    expenditure. I’m still something of a tradesman, in fact, in the sense that I’m
                    anxious to prove that I pay my debts, and know what I want for the merchandise
                    that the lousy trade of a poor painter forces me to labour at.</p>
                <p>Ah well, I feel more or less sure of succeeding in making a decoration that will
                    be worth 10 thousand francs in time. Let me say — If here we set up a
                    studio-refuge for one or other of our pals who are broke, no one will ever be
                    able to reproach us, neither you nor me, with living and spending for ourselves
                    alone. Now to set up such a studio you need a working capital; now it’s I who
                    have eaten it up in the course of my unproductive years, and I’ll pay it back
                    now that I’m beginning to produce. I assure you that, for you as well as for me,
                    I judge it to be indispensable, but what’s more our right, always to have a
                    louis or a few louis in our pocket, and a certain stock of merchandise to
                    handle. But my idea would be that in the end we’d have set up and would leave to
                    posterity a studio in which a successor could live. I don’t know if I’m
                    expressing myself clearly enough, but in other words: we’re working at an art,
                    at matters that won’t be of our times only but which may also be continued by
                    others after us. You’re doing that in your business; it’s undeniable that it
                    will increase in future, even though you have many vexations at present. But for
                    me, I foresee that other artists will wish to see colour under a stronger sun
                    and in a more Japanese clarity. Now if I set up a studio-refuge right at the
                    entrance to the south, that’s not so silly. And precisely that means that we can
                    work calmly. Ah, if others say, it’s too far from Paris &amp;c.? Let them, too
                    bad for them. Why did the greatest colourist of all, Eugène Delacroix, judge it
                    indispensable to go to the south, and as far as Africa? Obviously because not
                    only in Africa but even from Arles onwards you’ll naturally find fine contrasts
                    between reds and greens, blues and oranges, sulphur and lilac. And all true
                    colourists will have to come to admit that there exists another coloration than
                    that of the north. And I don’t doubt that if Gauguin came, he would love this
                    part of the country; if Gauguin didn’t come, it’s because he has already had
                    this experience of more colourful countries, and he’d still be one of our
                    friends and in agreement in principle. And another one of them would come in his
                    place. If what we’re doing looks out toward the infinite, if we see our work
                    having its raison d’être and continuing on beyond, we work with more serenity.
                    Now you have that twice over. </p>
                <p>You’re kind to painters, and be sure that the more I think about it the more I
                    feel that there’s nothing more genuinely artistic than to love people. You’ll
                    say to me that then we’d do well to do without art and artists. That’s true on
                    the face of it, but after all, the Greeks and the French and the old Dutchmen
                    accepted art, and we see art always recover after inevitable periods of decline
                    — and I don’t believe that we’d be more virtuous for this reason, that we had a
                    horror of artists and their art. At present I don’t yet find my paintings good
                    enough for the benefits I’ve had from you. But once they’re good enough, I
                    assure you that you will have created them just as much as I, and the fact is
                    that we make them together. But I won’t labour the point, because it will become
                    as clear as daylight to you if I succeed in doing things a little more
                    seriously. <work origin="new" stage="middle"> moment I have another no. 30
                        square canvas on the go,</work> a garden again, or rather a walk under plane
                    trees, with green turf and black clumps of pines. You did very well to order the
                    colours and the canvas, because the weather is superb, superb. The mistral is
                    still there, but there are intervals of calm, and then it’s wonderful. If we had
                    less mistral, this part of the country would really be as beautiful, and would
                    lend itself as much to art, as Japan. As I write, very kind letter from Bernard,
                    who’s thinking of coming to Arles this winter — whim — but then, perhaps it’s
                    also that Gauguin is sending him to me as a substitute, and would himself prefer
                    to stay in the north. We’ll know soon, because I’m sure that he’ll write to you
                    one way or another. Bernard’s letter speaks of Gauguin with great respect and
                    sympathy, and I’m convinced that they have mutually understood one another. And
                    I certainly believe that Gauguin has done Bernard good. Whether Gauguin comes or
                    not, he’ll still be one of our friends, and if he doesn’t come now he’ll come at
                    another time. I instinctively feel that Gauguin is a calculating person, who,
                    seeing himself at the bottom of the social ladder, wishes to regain a position
                    by means that will be honest, to be sure, but which will be very shrewd. Gauguin
                    has little idea that I’m able to take account of all that. And he perhaps
                    doesn’t know that he must at all costs gain time, and that he’ll gain it with
                    us, if he were to gain nothing else thereby. Now if one of these days he does a
                    bunk from Pont-Aven with Laval or Maurin without paying his debt, in my opinion
                    he would still be in the right in his case, just like any animal at bay. I don’t
                    believe that it’s wise to offer Bernard 150 francs for one painting a month
                    immediately, as we’ve offered Gauguin. And isn’t Bernard, who has clearly talked
                    at length with Gauguin about the whole business, rather counting on replacing
                    Gauguin? I believe that it’ll be necessary to be very firm and very categorical
                    in all of this. And without giving our reasons, to speak very clearly. I can’t
                    blame Gauguin — speculator, stockbroker — if he wishes to risk something in
                    business, only I myself wouldn’t be part of it, I’d a thousand times sooner
                    continue with you, whether you’re with the Goupils or not. And the new dealers
                    are, as you know full well, exactly the same as the old ones in my opinion. In
                    principle, in theory, I’m for an association of artists protecting their
                    livelihood and their work, but in principle and in theory I’m equally against
                    attempts to destroy old firms, once established. Just let them rot in peace and
                    die a natural death. It’s pure presumption to try to revive the trade. Have
                    nothing to do with it, protect your livelihoods among yourselves, live as a
                    family, as brothers and companions; splendid; even in a case where that didn’t
                    succeed, I’d like to be part of it, but I’ll never be part of a manoeuvre
                    against other dealers.</p>
            </body>
            <close>I shake your hand firmly; I hope that what I’m forced to ask of you won’t cause
                you too much financial trouble. But I didn’t want to delay going to sleep at my
                house. And if you’re in financial difficulties yourself, I’ll get through the week
                with 20 francs more, but that will be urgent. </close>
            <sig>Ever yours, Vincent</sig>
            <ps>
                <p>The letter that Gauguin will send you shortly will, I’m inclined to believe,
                    clear the matter up. I myself don’t blame an artist of his merit for saying,
                    you’ll pay my journey and my debt if you wish me to come, because I don’t have
                    any — any money. But on the other hand, in that case he’d have to be very
                    generous with his paintings. Then — but we’d still have to have the money — I
                    wouldn’t see any harm in the thing. But these paintings, which will be sold one
                    day, will tie up the interest on what they cost, perhaps for many years to come.
                    And in fact, a painting for which we pay 400 francs today and which we sell for
                    1,000 francs ten years later is still sold at cost price, because it has sat
                    there doing nothing. But you know this better than I do. I shouldn’t be
                    surprised if little by little you regain a love of business, or at least that
                    you’ll be reconciled with your present position when you’ll feel that those who
                    invent new things in business don’t know how to make a great revolution in it.
                    You’re kind to artists, you are, in fact, right at the heart of the trade, you
                    do what you can, you’re damned right. Only take care of your health if you can,
                    and don’t get upset about nothing. That will come quite of its own accord now,
                    if it must come. I only want to emphasize this, that it seems to me that
                    Gauguin, by giving you alone his paintings on deposit, and quietly waiting for
                    his moment while working here with me and repaying our advances with his work,
                    would be pursuing a policy that I would respect more than any other position he
                    could take.For Bernard, if Bernard wished to come here, it wouldn’t be on the
                    same conditions as Gauguin — it would seem to me. If there was a benefit in
                    living together, there’s nothing to prevent you agreeing to buy something from
                    him from time to time, if it’s possible. But no sort of contract with him, he’s
                    too changeable. If Gauguin doesn’t come, he’ll succeed all the same, but he
                    won’t succeed through his contrivance, but through the real merit of his
                    canvases. As long as he keeps the time and the money and the freedom needed to
                    do them, that’s all. I can assure you that I would certainly not be a better
                    dealer than you; in the given circumstances you do perfectly well, and I’d only
                    wish to send you better paintings. I’m trying to do that, and I’ll continue to
                    try to do so. I expect to return to my garden canvas again soon. It’s an immense
                    advantage that I have, not to be short of canvases and colours, and so it’s
                    certainly my duty to work without respite. If Gauguin came, I’m inclined to
                    believe that we’d make our colours at home ourselves; I daren’t do it on my own,
                    because I fear that it would discourage me if it didn’t work straightaway. I’m
                    very curious to know what Tanguy will charge for his tubes. Did you read an
                    article in the number of Le Courrier Français that you sent, ‘la truie bleue’?
                    Very good, and it reminds you precisely of La Segatori. You’ll enjoy reading
                    that article. I’ll see Milliet today, I think. Thank you in advance for the
                    Japanese prints. I’m keeping all Bernard’s letters, they’re sometimes really
                    interesting; you’ll read them some day or other; they already make quite a
                    bundle.This firmness I was speaking of, that it will be necessary to have with
                    Gauguin, it’s solely because we already made our position clear when he
                    described his plan of action in Paris. You replied well then without committing
                    yourself, but also without wounding him in his amour propre. And it’s the same
                    thing that could be necessary again.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>The fine weather of these past few days has disappeared and has been replaced by
                    mud and rain. But it will surely return before the winter. Only it’ll be a
                    matter of taking advantage of it because —the fine days — are short —Especially
                    for painting. <work origin="new" stage="planned">I plan to do a lot of drawing
                        this winter.</work> If only I could draw figures from memory, I’d always
                    have something to do, but — take a figure by the most skilful of all the artists
                    who sketch from life — Hokusai, Daumier, for me this figure is never what the
                    figure painted from the model by these same masters would be, or other master
                    portraitists. Ah well — if inevitably we’re too often faced with a shortage of
                    models, and especially of intelligent models, we mustn’t despair or grow weary
                    of the struggle for that reason.</p>
                <p>I’ve arranged all the Japanese prints in the studio, and the Daumiers and the
                    Delacroixs and the Géricault. If you come across the Delacroix Pietà, or the
                    Géricault, I urge you to buy as many of them as you can. Another thing that I’d
                    very much like to have in the studio is Millet’s Labours of the fields — and
                    Lerat’s etching of his Sower that Durand-Ruel is selling for 1.25 francs. And
                    lastly the little etching by Jacquemart after Meissonier, The reader. A
                    Meissonier that I’ve always found admirable. I can’t help liking
                    Meissoniers.</p>
                <p>I’m reading an article on Tolstoy in the Revue des Deux Mondes — it appears that
                    Tolstoy takes an enormous interest in his people’s religion. Like George Eliot
                    in England. There’s said to be a religious book by Tolstoy, I believe it’s
                    called ‘Ma religion’; it must be very beautiful. From what I gather from that
                    article, in it he’s searching for what will remain eternally true in the
                    religion of Christ, and what all religions have in common; it appears that he
                    admits of neither the resurrection of the body nor even that of the soul, but
                    says like the nihilists that after death there’s nothing more, but when a man’s
                    dead, and well and truly dead, living humanity remains for ever. Anyway, not
                    having read the book itself, I couldn’t say exactly how he conceives of the
                    matter, but I believe that his religion cannot be cruel and increase our
                    sufferings, but on the contrary, it must be very consoling and must inspire
                    serenity, and energy, and the courage to live, and a whole lot of things.</p>
                <p>Among Bing’s reproductions I find the drawing of the blade of grass, and the
                    carnations, and the Hokusai admirable. But whatever one may say, for me the more
                    ordinary Japanese prints, coloured in flat tones, are admirable for the same
                    reason as Rubens and Veronese. I know perfectly well that this isn’t primitive
                    art. But the fact that the primitives are admirable isn’t in the very least a
                    reason for me to say, as is becoming a habit, ‘when I go to the Louvre I can’t
                    go beyond the primitives’. Supposing one were to say to a serious collector of
                    Japanese art — to Lévy himself — sir, I cannot help finding these 5-sous
                    Japanese prints admirable — It’s more than likely that that person would be a
                    bit shocked and would pity my ignorance and my bad taste. Exactly as in the past
                    it was in bad taste to like Rubens, Jordaens, Veronese. <stress
                        reason="environment">I believe that eventually I’ll stop feeling lonely in
                        the house,</stress> and that on days of bad winter weather, for example, and
                    in the long evenings, I’ll find an occupation that will absorb me completely. A
                    weaver, a basket-maker, often spends entire seasons alone, or almost alone, with
                    his work as his only pastime. But what makes those people stay where they are is
                    precisely the feeling of the house, the reassuring, familiar look of things. Of
                    course I’d like company, but if I don’t have it I won’t be unhappy on that
                    account, and then, above all, the time will come when I’ll have someone. I have
                    little doubt about that.</p>
                <p>Now in your home too, I believe that if one is willing to put people up one can
                    find plenty among artists, for whom the matter of somewhere to stay is a very
                    serious problem. And for me, I believe that it’s my absolute duty to try to earn
                    money with my work, and so I see my work quite clearly ahead of me. Ah, if only
                    all artists had enough to live on — enough to work on — but that not being so,
                        <work origin="new" stage="planned">I wish to produce, and to produce a great
                        deal, and with intense effort and determination.</work> And perhaps the day
                    will come when we can expand our business and be more influential for others.
                    But that’s a long way off, and there’s a great deal of work to be got through
                    first. If we were living in wartime we’d possibly have to fight, we’d regret it,
                    we’d bemoan not living in peacetime, but at all events, the necessity being
                    there — we’d fight. And in the same way, we surely have the right to wish for a
                    state of affairs in which money wouldn’t be needed in order to live. However,
                    since everything’s done with money now, we must think hard about making some
                    while we spend it. But I have a better chance of earning from painting than from
                    drawing. In short, there are many more people who can skilfully make a croquis
                    than people who can paint freely and who grasp nature from the point of view of
                    colour. That will always be rarer, and whether or not the paintings are slow to
                    be appreciated, they’ll find their collector one day. But I believe that as for
                    the paintings with rather thick impasto, they’ll have to dry longer here. I’ve
                    read that Rubenses in Spain have remained infinitely richer in colour than those
                    in the north. Ruins, even exposed to the open air, remain white here, whereas in
                    the north they turn grey, dirty, black, &amp;c. You can be sure that if the
                    Monticellis had dried in Paris they’d now be very much duller.</p>
                <p>I’m beginning now to see better the beauty of the women here, and so always,
                    always I think again of Monticelli. Colour plays an immense part in the beauty
                    of the women here — I’m not saying that their forms aren’t beautiful, but that’s
                    not where the local charm lies. It’s the broad lines of the colourful costume,
                    worn well, and it’s the tone of the flesh more than the form. But I’ll have
                    trouble before I’ll be able to do them in the way I’m beginning to feel it. But
                    what I’m certain of is making progress while staying here. And a certain
                    skilfulness isn’t enough to make a painting that would be truly of the south.
                    It’s looking at things for a long time that matures you and makes you understand
                    more deeply. I hadn’t thought when leaving Paris that I would have found
                    Monticelli and Delacroix so true. It’s only now, after months and more months,
                    that I’m beginning to realize that they didn’t imagine anything. And I think
                    that next year you’ll see the same subjects again: orchards, the harvest, but —
                    with a different colour and above all, altered execution. And that will still
                    continue, these changes and these variations. Even while working, I feel that I
                    needn’t rush. After all, what would it do to put into practice the old saying
                    that one should study for ten years or so, and then produce a few figure
                    paintings? That’s what Monticelli did, though. Think of several hundred of his
                    paintings as no more than studies. Then, however, figures the way the yellow
                    woman was, the way the woman with the parasol is, the small one that you have,
                    the lovers that Reid had, those are complete figures, in which as far as the
                    drawing goes there’s absolutely nothing to do but to admire it. Because there
                    Monticelli achieves a way of drawing that’s as rich and superb as Daumier and
                    Delacroix. Certainly, at the prices Monticellis are at, it would be an excellent
                    speculation to buy some. The day will come when his fine drawn figures will be
                    valued as very great art. I believe that the town of Arles was once infinitely
                    more glorious for the beauty of its women, for the beauty of its traditional
                    dress. Now it all looks sickly and faded as far as character goes. But if you
                    look at it for a long time, the old charm reveals itself. And that’s why I
                    understand that I’m losing absolutely nothing by staying where I am, and
                    contenting myself with watching things go by, the way a spider in its web waits
                    for flies. I can’t force anything, and as I’m settled now I can take advantage
                    of all the fine days, all the opportunities to catch a real painting from time
                    to time.</p>
                <p>Milliet’s lucky, he has all the Arlésiennes he wants, but there you are, he can’t
                    paint them, and if he was a painter he wouldn’t have any. I must bide my time
                    now, without rushing anything. I’ve read an article on Wagner — L’amour dans la
                    musique, by the same author who wrote the book on Wagner, I believe. What a need
                    we have of the same thing in painting! It seems that in the book Ma religion,
                    Tolstoy suggests that whatever may occur in the way of a violent revolution,
                    there will also be a private, secret revolution in people, from which a new
                    religion, or rather, something altogether new, will be reborn, which will have
                    no name but which will have the same effect of consoling, of making life
                    possible, that the Christian religion once had. It seems to me that that book
                    must be very interesting. We’ll eventually have enough of cynicism, scepticism,
                    mockery, and we’ll want to live — more musically. How will that come about, and
                    what will we find? It would be curious to be able to predict it, but it’s even
                    better to have a feeling of what it will be, instead of seeing in the future
                    absolutely nothing but disasters, which will nevertheless be sure to fall into
                    the modern world and civilization like so many terrible thunderbolts, through a
                    revolution or a war or the bankruptcy of moth-eaten governments. If we study
                    Japanese art, then we see a man, undoubtedly wise and a philosopher and
                    intelligent, who spends his time — on what? — studying the distance from the
                    earth to the moon? — no; studying Bismarck’s politics? — no, he studies a single
                    blade of grass. But this blade of grass leads him to draw all the plants — then
                    the seasons, the broad features of landscapes, finally animals, and then the
                    human figure. He spends his life like that, and life is too short to do
                    everything. Just think of that; isn’t it almost a new religion that these
                    Japanese teach us, who are so simple and live in nature as if they themselves
                    were flowers? And we wouldn’t be able to study Japanese art, it seems to me,
                    without becoming much happier and more cheerful, and it makes us return to
                    nature, despite our education and our work in a world of convention. Isn’t it
                    saddening that up to now Monticellis have never been reproduced in fine
                    lithographs or vibrant etchings? I’d like to see what artists would say if an
                    engraver like the one who engraved the work of Velázquez were to do a fine
                    etching of them. Be that as it may, I believe it’s still more our duty to try to
                    admire and to know things for ourselves than to teach them to others. But the
                    two things can go together. I envy the Japanese the extreme clarity that
                    everything in their work has. It’s never dull, and never appears to be done too
                    hastily. Their work is as simple as breathing, and they do a figure with a few
                    confident strokes with the same ease as if it was as simple as buttoning your
                    waistcoat. Ah, I must manage to do a figure with a few strokes. That will keep
                    me busy all winter. Once I have that, I’ll be able to do people strolling along
                    the boulevards, the streets, a host of new subjects. While I’ve been writing you
                    this letter, I’ve drawn a good dozen of them. I’m on the track of finding it.
                    But it’s very complicated, because what I’m after is that in a few strokes the
                    figure of a man, a woman, a kid, a horse, a dog, will have a head, a body, legs,
                    arms that will fit together.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>I’m well aware that I wrote to you only yesterday, <unstress reason="environment"
                        >but the day has been so beautiful again.</unstress> My great sorrow is that
                    you can’t see what I see here. From 7 o’clock in the morning I sat in front of
                    what was, after all, nothing special — a round cedar or cypress bush — planted
                    in grass. You know this round bush already, since you already have a study of
                    the garden. <work origin="new" stage="finished">By the way, included herewith a
                        croquis of my canvas — a square no. 30 again.</work> The bush is a
                    variegated green, slightly tinged with bronze, the grass is very, very green,
                    Veronese tinged with lemon, the sky is very, very blue. The line of bushes in
                    the background are all raving mad oleanders. These bloody plants flower in such
                    a way that they could surely catch locomotor ataxia! They’re covered in fresh
                    blooms, and then in masses of faded blooms; their foliage also keeps on putting
                    out strong new shoots, apparently inexhaustibly. A funereal cypress, completely
                    black, stands above them and a number of small coloured figures are strolling
                    along a pink path. It makes a pendant for another no. 30 canvas of the same
                    place, only from a quite different viewpoint, in which the whole garden is
                    coloured in very different greens under a pale lemon yellow sky. But isn’t it
                    true that this garden has a funny sort of style that means that you can very
                    well imagine the Renaissance poets, Dante, Petrarch, Boccaccio, strolling among
                    these bushes on the flowery grass? Now it’s true that I’ve left out some trees,
                    but what I’ve kept in the composition is really like that. Only they’ve
                    overcrowded it with a number of bushes that aren’t in character; and so to find
                    this truer and more fundamental character, this is the third time I’m painting
                    the same spot. Now that’s the garden that’s right in front of my house, after
                    all. But this corner of a garden is a good example of what I was telling you,
                    that to find the real character of things here, you have to look at them and
                    paint them for a very long time. Because perhaps you’ll see from the sketch
                    alone that the line is now simple. Again, this painting is heavily impasted,
                    like its pendant with yellow sky.</p>
                <p>
                    <work origin="new" stage="planned">Tomorrow I hope to work with Milliet
                        again.</work> Today I worked again from 7 o’clock in the morning until 6
                    o’clock in the evening without moving except to eat a bite a stone’s throw away.
                    And that’s why the work’s going fast. But what will you say about it — how will
                    it seem to me, too, some time from now? At the moment I have a clear head, or a
                    lover’s blindness toward my work. Because being surrounded by colour like this
                    is quite new to me, <unstress reason="environment">and excites me
                        extraordinarily.</unstress> Fatigue doesn’t come into it; I could do another
                    painting tonight, even, and I could bring it home. If I tell you that it’s very
                    urgent that I receive 6 large tubes lemon chrome yellow I 6 ,, ,, Veronese green
                    3 ,, ,, Prussian blue. 10 ,, ,, zinc white large tubes like the zinc and silver
                    whitethen it’s to be deducted from yesterday’s order. Also 5 metres of canvas. I
                    can’t help it, I feel in a clear frame of mind and I want as far as possible to
                    make sure that I have enough paintings to maintain my position when the others
                    will also be making a great effort for the year ’89. Seurat has enough, with 2
                    or 3 of his enormous canvases, to exhibit all by himself; Signac, who’s a good
                    worker, also has enough, Gauguin too, and Guillaumin. So I’d like, myself, to
                    have by that time — whether we were to exhibit it or not — the series of
                    studies: Decoration. That way we’ll be entirely original, because the others
                    won’t be able to find us pretentious when that’s all we have. But be assured
                    that I’ll try to give it a style.</p>
                <p>Milliet was pleased today that I’d done the ploughed field; usually he doesn’t
                    like what I do, but because the clods of earth were soft in colour, like a pair
                    of clogs, it didn’t offend him — with the forget-me-not sky with its flecks of
                    white cloud. If he posed better he would please me greatly, and he would have a
                    smarter portrait than I’ll be able do now, although the subject itself is
                    beautiful: his face with its pale, matt complexion, the red képi against an
                    emerald background. Ah, how I’d like you to see everything that I see these
                    days! <unstress reason="environment">With so many beautiful things before me, I
                        can’t help letting myself go.</unstress> Especially because I feel that
                    it’ll turn out a little better than the last consignment. But the last
                    consignment was of studies that made me ready to be able to work with confidence
                    these days that are windless. Why is it that our good père Thomas isn’t willing
                    to lend me something on my studies? He’d be wrong not to do it — and I hope that
                    he will do it. I’m fearful of overburdening you, and yet I’d like to order a
                    good two hundred francs worth of colours and canvases and brushes. It’s not for
                    something else, it’s for that. The whole autumn may be good, and if I knock out
                    a no. 30 canvas every two or three days, I’ll earn blenty of thousand-frenk
                    pills. I have a concentrated strength still, which asks for nothing but to be
                    used up in work. But I’ll inevitably begin to use up a quantity of colours, and
                    that’s why we’d need Thomas. If I continue working as I am these days, I’ll have
                    my study full of really sound studies, the way it is at Guillaumin’s. Guillaumin
                    must have some fine new things, of course, I don’t doubt it and I’d very much
                    like to see them. The present studies actually consist of a single flow of
                    impasto. The brushstroke isn’t greatly divided, and the tones are often broken.
                    And in the end, without intending to, I’m forced to lay the paint on thickly, à
                    la Monticelli. Sometimes I really believe I’m continuing that man’s work, only I
                    haven’t yet done figures of lovers, like him. And it’s probable that I won’t do
                    it, either, before some serious studies from life.</p>
                <p>But that’s not urgent; now I’m determined to work hard until I’ve surmounted it.
                    If I want this letter to go off, I must hurry. Have you any news of Gauguin? I
                    expect a letter from Bernard at any moment, which will follow the croquis,
                    probably. Gauguin must have another partnership in mind; I’ve felt that for
                    weeks and yet more weeks. He’s certainly free to do so. Being alone won’t bother
                    me for the time being, and later on we’ll find some company anyway, and perhaps
                    more than we’ll want. Only I believe that we mustn’t say anything unpleasant to
                    Gauguin if he were to change his mind, and take the thing entirely in good part.
                    Because if he joins up with Laval, that’s only fair, since Laval’s his pupil and
                    they’ve already kept house together. If it came to it, well, they could both
                    come here and we’d find a way of putting them up. As for the furnishing, if I’d
                    known in advance that Gauguin wasn’t coming, I’d still have wanted to have two
                    beds in case I had to put someone up. So he’s definitely quite free. There will
                    always be those who have a wish to see the south. What has Vignon been doing??
                    Ah well, if it all turns out for the best everyone will be sure to make great
                    progress, and me too. If you can’t see the beautiful days here, you’ll still see
                    the paintings of them. And I’m trying to make them better than the others.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>I had hardly dared hope so soon for your new 50-franc money order, for which I
                    thank you very much. I have many expenses, <stress reason="money">and it
                        sometimes distresses me greatly when I increasingly come to realize that
                        painting is a craft that is probably practised by extremely poor people,
                        since it costs a lot of money.</stress> But the autumn still continues to be
                    so fine! What a funny part of the country, this homeland of Tartarin’s! Yes,
                        <good_health>I’m happy with my lot;</good_health> it isn’t a superb and
                    sublime country, it’s all something out of Daumier come to life. Have you
                    re-read the Tartarins yet? Ah, don’t forget to! Do you remember in Tartarin the
                    lament of the old Tarascon diligence — that wonderful page? <work origin="new"
                        stage="finished">Well, I’ve just painted that red and green carriage in the
                        yard of the inn.</work> You’ll see. This hasty croquis gives you its
                    composition. Simple foreground of grey sand. Background very simple too, pink
                    and yellow walls with windows with green louvred shutters, corner of blue sky.
                    The two carriages very colourful: green, red, wheels yellow, black, blue,
                    orange. A no. 30 canvas once again. The carriages are painted in the style of
                    Monticelli, with impastos. You once had a very beautiful Claude Monet, of 4
                    colourful boats on a beach. Well, here it’s carriages, but the composition is of
                    the same kind. Now imagine a huge green-blue fir tree spreading its horizontal
                    branches over a very green lawn and sand dappled with light and shade. This very
                    simple corner of a garden is enlivened by beds of orange lead geraniums in the
                    background areas, under the black branches. <work origin="new" stage="finished"
                        >Two figures of lovers stand in the shade of the big tree. No. 30
                        canvas.</work>
                    <work origin="new" stage="finished">And then two more no. 30 canvases, the
                        Trinquetaille bridge and another bridge; the railway goes over the
                        road.</work> That canvas is a little like a Bosboom in coloration. Lastly,
                    the Trinquetaille bridge with all its steps is a canvas done on a grey morning,
                    the stones, the asphalt, the cobblestones are grey, the sky a pale blue, the
                    small figures colourful, a puny tree with yellow foliage. Two canvases, then, in
                    grey, broken tones, and two highly coloured canvases. Forgive these very poor
                    croquis. I’m knocked out from painting this Tarascon diligence, and I can see
                    that I haven’t a head fit for drawing. </p>
                <p>I’m off to have supper, and I’ll write to you again this evening. But this
                    decoration is coming along a bit, and I believe that it will broaden my way of
                    seeing and doing things. It will be open to a thousand criticisms; very well,
                    but never mind, as long as I manage to put some spirit into it. But yes, good
                    old Tartarin’s country, I’m enjoying myself there more and more, and it will
                    become like a new homeland for us. I don’t forget Holland, though; it’s
                    precisely the contrasts that make me think of it a lot. I’ll get back to this
                    letter shortly.</p>
                <p>Now I’m getting back to this letter again. How<work origin="new" stage="middle">
                        I’d like to be able to show you the work that’s in progress!</work> I’m
                    really so tired that I can see that my writing isn’t up to much. I’ll write to
                    you better another time, because it’s beginning to take shape now, this idea of
                    the decoration. I wrote to Gauguin again the day before yesterday, to say once
                    again that he would probably recover much more quickly here. And he’ll do such
                    fine things here. He’ll need time to recover. I assure you that I believe that
                    if ideas for work are coming to me more clearly and more abundantly at present,
                    then eating good food has a lot to do with it. And that’s what everybody in
                    painting should have.</p>
                <p>How many things that still have to change! Isn’t it true that all painters ought
                    to live like manual workers? A carpenter, a blacksmith, normally produces
                    infinitely more than they do. In painting too, there should be large studios
                    where each person would work more steadily. I’m really falling asleep standing
                    up, and I can’t see any longer, my eyes are so tired. More soon, because I still
                    had lots of things to say, and I should make you some better croquis. Probable
                    that I’ll do it tomorrow. Thank you many times again for your money order.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Letter from Gauguin, who tells me that he’s sent you a consignment of paintings
                    and studies. Would be very pleased if you could find the time to write and give
                    me some details of what they are. His letter was accompanied by a letter from
                    Bernard, to say that they’d received my consignment of canvases, that they’re
                    going to keep all 7 of them. Bernard will make another study for me in exchange,
                    and the three others, Moret, Laval and a young chap, will also send portraits, I
                    hope. Gauguin has my portrait, and Bernard says that he’d like to have one like
                    it, although he already has one of me, which I exchanged with him at the time
                    for the portrait of his Grandmother. And it pleased me that they weren’t averse
                    to what I had done in figure painting.</p>
                <p>I was, and still am, almost knocked out by last week’s work. I still can’t do
                    anything, but in any case there’s a very violent mistral, which raises clouds of
                    dust that turns the trees on boulevard des Lices white from top to bottom. So
                    I’m pretty well forced to take it easy. I’ve just slept for 16 hours at a
                    stretch, which has gone a long way to making me myself again. And tomorrow I’ll
                    have got over this exhaustion. But I made a good week of it, eh, <work
                        origin="existing" stage="finished">with 5 canvases;</work> if it gets a bit
                    of its own back this week, well, it’s natural. If I’d worked more calmly, you
                    can see clearly that the mistral would have caught me out again. Ah, if the
                    weather’s fine here you have to take advantage of it, otherwise you’d never do
                    anything.</p>
                <p>But tell me what Seurat’s doing. If you see him, tell him on my behalf that <work
                        origin="new" stage="middle">I have in progress a decoration which at present
                        amounts to 15 square no.</work> 30 canvases, and which, to make an ensemble,
                    will take at least 15 more, and that in this work on a broader scale it’s often
                    the memory of his personality and of the visit that we made to his studio to see
                    his beautiful big canvases that gives me courage in this task. I’d very much
                    like us to have Seurat’s portrait of himself. I had told Gauguin that the reason
                    I had urged him to make an exchange of portraits was because I believed that he
                    and Bernard would certainly have made several studies, each of the other. That
                    as that wasn’t the case and he had done the portrait especially for me, I didn’t
                    want it as an exchange, considering the thing too important. He writes to say
                    that he really does wish me to take it as an exchange. His letter is again very
                    complimentary, as I don’t deserve it, let’s pass over it.</p>
                <p>I’m sending you article on Provence which seemed well-written to me. These
                    Félibres are a literary and artistic circle: Clovis Hugues, Mistral, others, who
                    write quite good, even sometimes very good sonnets in Provençal and sometimes in
                    French. If one day the Félibres stop being unaware of my existence, they’ll all
                    visit the little house. I prefer that it not happen before I’ve finished my
                    decoration. But loving Provence as whole-heartedly as they do, I perhaps have a
                    right to their interest. If ever I insist on that right, it will be so that my
                    work remains here or in Marseille, where, as you know, I’d like to work,
                    believing that the Marseille artists would do well to continue what their
                    Monticelli started. If Gauguin and I write an article in one of the papers here,
                    that will be enough to make contact.</p>

                <p>
                    <work origin="new" stage="finished">I have another no. 30 canvas, autumn garden,
                        two bottle-green and bottle-shaped cypresses, three little chestnut trees
                        with tobacco-coloured and orange foliage.</work> A small yew with pale lemon
                    foliage, with purple trunk. Two small bushes with blood-red and scarlet purple
                    foliage. A little sand, a little lawn, a little blue sky. There you are, and yet
                    I’d sworn not to work! But it’s like that every day, <unstress
                        reason="environment">sometimes in passing I find such beautiful things that
                        in the end you have to try to do them anyway.</unstress> Ah well, the money
                    that you give me and which, besides, I’m asking from you more than ever, I’ll
                    return it to you in work, and not only the present but the past as well. But let
                    me work as long as it isn’t absolutely impossible. Because if I don’t take
                    advantage of the opportunities, it would be even worse.</p>
                <p>Ah, my dear brother, if I could do such a thing, or if Gauguin and I together
                    could do such things that Seurat would join us! But in my opinion, at the very
                    least we must reckon his large paintings of the models and the Grande Jatte but
                    — let’s see — at 5,000 each, shall we say... Ah well, if we were to join
                    together, Gauguin and I should each also be capable of a nominal contribution of
                    10 thousand. Once again that falls right in line with what I was telling you,
                    that I wished absolutely absolutely to do 10 thousand francs worth of painting
                    for the house. Well, it’s funny, although I don’t calculate in figures but in
                    feelings, I so often happen upon the same results while starting from totally
                    divergent standpoints. I daren’t dream about it, I daren’t say any more about
                    this Seurat partnership. First I must try to get to know Gauguin better. With
                    whom one can’t go wrong, no matter what.</p>
                <p>And listen to this. As soon as you can, and even right away if the thing were
                    possible, I need another 10 metres of canvas at 2.50 francs. Then large tubes
                    like the silver white and zinc white.zinc white 20 of the largest tubes Silver
                    ,, 10 ,, ,, ,, ,, Chrome Yellow I 10 ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, 2 5 ,, ,, ,,, ,, Prussian
                    Blue 5 Geranium Lake 10 medium tubes Veronese Green 10 largest tubes. Ah well, I
                    must say nevertheless that it would absolutely astonish me if we weren’t able to
                    overcome NO MATTER WHAT difficulties of production. But the present ones all the
                    more so. If it went wrong we’d have to have deliberations as soon as Gauguin
                    arrived, which I hope will be any day now. I believe it possible that things
                    could get jolly lively at the ’89 exhibition. It might be better if they didn’t
                    get lively, but after all, we’ll just have to take things as they come.</p>
                <p>By the way, have you ever read Les frères Zemganno, by the De Goncourts? If not,
                    read it. If I hadn’t read it I would perhaps be more daring. And even after
                    reading it, the ONLY fear that I have is of asking you for too much money. If
                    myself I were to break myself down in the effort, it would mean absolutely
                    nothing to me. I still have resources for that eventuality, because I would
                    either go into the business or I would write, but as long as I’m in painting I
                    see nothing but the association of several people, and the communal life. The
                    leaves are starting to fall; the trees are visibly yellowing, the yellow
                    increasing every day. <unstress reason="environment">It’s at least as beautiful
                        as the orchards in blossom,</unstress> and as for the work that we may do, I
                    dare believe that indeed far from losing by it, we could gain by it. But anyway.
                    In any case, would you please send me some more money (50 if possible, and
                    otherwise less) by return of post and certainly no later. And if you didn’t have
                    time to write, I’d ask you please to send it by money order, whether it’s more,
                    or less, as you were able.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Thank you for your letter and for the 50-franc note. As you learned from my
                    telegram, Gauguin arrived in good health. He even gave me the impression of
                    being in better shape than me. He’s naturally very pleased with the sale that
                    you made, and I no less, since that way certain other expenses absolutely
                    necessary for moving in needn’t wait nor will fall on your shoulders alone. G.
                    will certainly write to you today. He’s very, very interesting as a man, and I
                    have every confidence that with him we’ll do a great many things. He’ll probably
                    produce a great deal here, and perhaps I shall too, I hope. And then I dare
                    believe that for you the burden will be a little less heavy, and I dare believe
                    much less heavy. I myself feel, to the point of being mentally crushed and
                    physically drained, the need to produce, <stress reason="career">precisely
                        because in short I have no other means, none, none, of ever recouping our
                        outlay.</stress> I can do nothing about it if my paintings don’t sell. The
                    day will come, though, when people will see that they’re worth more than the
                    cost of the paint and my subsistence, very meagre in fact, that we put into
                    them. <stress reason="money">I have no other wish nor other concern regarding
                        money or finances than in the first place not to have debts.</stress> But my
                    dear brother, my debt is so great that when I’ve paid it, which I think I’ll
                    succeed in doing, the hardship of producing paintings will, however, have taken
                    my entire life, <stress reason="career">and it will seem to me that I haven’t
                        lived.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>The only thing is that perhaps the production of paintings will become a little
                    more difficult for me, and as far as the number goes, there won’t always be as
                    many. The fact that they don’t sell now makes me anxious that you’re suffering
                    too, but it would be of little concern to me if you didn’t become too hard up by
                    my bringing nothing in. But in money matters it’s enough for me to feel this
                    truth, that a man who lives for 50 years and spends two thousand a year spends a
                    hundred thousand francs, and that he must bring a hundred thousand in, too.
                        <stress reason="career">To make a thousand paintings at a hundred francs
                        during one’s life as an artist is very, very, very hard, but when the
                        painting is at a hundred francs...... and again.... our task is very heavy
                        at times.</stress> But nothing about that can be altered. We’ll let Tasset
                    down completely, probably, because to a large extent at least, we’ll use less
                    expensive colours, both Gauguin and I. As for canvas, we’ll also prepare it
                    ourselves. For a time I had the slight feeling that I was going to be ill, but
                    Gauguin’s arrival has so taken my mind off it that I’m sure it will pass. I
                    mustn’t neglect my diet for a while, and that’s all. And absolutely all.</p>
                <p>And after a time you’ll have some work. Gauguin has brought a magnificent canvas
                    that he exchanged with Bernard, Breton women in a green meadow. White, black,
                    green and a red note, and the matt tones of the flesh. Anyway, let’s all be of
                    good heart. I believe that the day will come when I’ll sell too, but I’m so far
                    behind with you, and while I spend I bring nothing in. <bad_health>That feeling
                        sometimes makes me sad.</bad_health> I’m very, very happy at what you write,
                    that one of the Dutchmen will come and live with you, and that that way you
                    won’t be alone any more, either. It’s perfectly, perfectly good, especially as
                    we’ll soon have winter. Anyway, I’m in a hurry, <work origin="new"
                        stage="middle">and have to go out to get back to work on another no. thirty
                        canvas.</work> Soon, when Gauguin writes to you, I’ll add another letter to
                    his. Of course, I don’t know in advance what Gauguin will say about this part of
                    the world and about our life, but in any case he’s very happy with the good sale
                    that you made for him.</p>
            </body>
            <close>More soon, and I shake your hand firmly.</close>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Thank you for your money order for 50 francs, which I’ve just received. I did
                    know that Gauguin had travelled, but I didn’t know he was a real seaman; he’s
                    been through all the difficulties, he was a real topman on the topmast and a
                    real sailor. That gives me a tremendous respect for him, and an even more
                    absolute confidence in his personality. He has — if he’s to be compared with
                    something — links with those Icelandic fishermen of Loti’s. I believe that it’ll
                    make the same impression on you as on me. Now we’ve done some work already, of
                    course; he has a negress on the go, and a big landscape of this region. What he
                    tells me about Brittany is very interesting, and Pont-Aven is a quite amazing
                    part of the world. Of course, everything there is better, bigger, more beautiful
                    than here. Of a more solemn character, and above all more of a whole and more
                    defined than the small, stunted, scorched countryside of Provence. Be that as it
                    may, he, like me, nevertheless likes what he sees, and is particularly intrigued
                    by the Arlésiennes.</p>
                <p>
                    <work origin="new" stage="finished">This week I did a new study of a
                        sower;</work> the landscape utterly flat, the figure small and blurred.
                        <work origin="new" stage="finished">Then I did another study of ploughed
                        field</work> with the stump of an old yew. Like this. And that’s all. How
                    are you, and did you do anything in Brussels? I’m still very glad to know that
                    you’re no longer alone in the apartment. <bad_health>My brain feels tired and
                        dry again,</bad_health> but I’m better this week than the previous
                    fortnight. What Gauguin has to say about the tropics seems wonderful to me.
                    There, certainly, is the future of a great renaissance of painting. Just ask
                    your new Dutch friends if they’ve ever thought how interesting it would be if a
                    few Dutch painters were to found a colourist school in Java. If they heard
                    Gauguin describe the hot countries they’d certainly feel like doing that
                    straightaway. Not everyone is free and in a position to be able to emigrate. But
                    what things there would be to do! I regret not being ten or twenty years
                    younger; I’d certainly go. Now not very likely that I’ll move from the coast,
                    and the little yellow house here in Arles will remain what it is, a halfway
                    house between Africa and the tropics and the people of the north.</p>
                <p>It’s now quite likely that Bernard will go to Africa, where he’ll be with
                    Milliet, who greets you warmly and will leave on the 1st November. In the
                    evening especially, with the gaslight, I like the look of the studio very much.
                    If you ever find any more Daumiers, don’t forget to get your hands on them. And
                    I believe that in the evening we’ll bring neighbours and friends here, and that
                    in the evening we’ll work as in the daytime, chatting as we do so. Portraits of
                    people lit by gaslight — that always seems to me a thing to do.</p>
            </body>
            <close>I shake your hand firmly, and write to us soon.</close>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>As for ill, I already told you I didn’t think I was, but I would have become so
                    if my expenses had had to continue. <stress reason="family">Since I was in a
                        state of terrible anxiety about making you make an effort beyond your
                        strength.</stress> On the one hand, I felt that I couldn’t do better than
                    push to complete what we started, to urge Gauguin to join us, and on the other
                    hand, as you may know from experience, when you furnish a house or move in, it’s
                    the case that it’s more difficult than you think. Now I dare breathe at last, as
                    we’ve all had a stroke of darned good fortune with the sale you were able to
                    make for Gauguin. One way or another, all three of us, he, you and I, will still
                    be able to pull ourselves together a bit, in order to calmly take in what we’ve
                    just done. Have no fear that I may have money worries. Now that Gauguin has
                    come, the goal has been achieved for the time being. By combining our expenses,
                    he and I, the two of us won’t even spend what living here was costing me just on
                    my own. He’ll even be able to put some money aside, the more he sells. Which, in
                    a year, let’s say, he can use to settle in Martinique, and which he couldn’t put
                    aside otherwise. You’ll have my work, and a painting by him in addition, every
                    month. And I’ll do the same work without having so much trouble, and without
                    running up so many expenses. But in the past it seemed to me that the
                    partnership that we’ve just entered into was a good policy.</p>
                <p>The house is going very, very well <unstress reason="environment">and is becoming
                        not only comfortable but also an artists’ house.</unstress> So have no fears
                    for me, nor for yourself, either. I had, in fact, a terrible feeling of anxiety
                    for you, because if Gauguin hadn’t had the same ideas, I would have caused you
                    some rather heavy expenses for nothing. But Gauguin is astonishing as a man; he
                    doesn’t get worked up, and he’ll wait here, very calmly, while at the same time
                    working hard, for the right moment to take a huge step forward. He needed rest
                    as much as I did. With the money that he’s just earned, he would have been able
                    to pay for rest in Brittany, too, of course, but as things are now, he’s sure to
                    be able to wait without falling into the inevitable debt again. We won’t spend
                    more than 250 a month between the two of us. And will spend much less on paint,
                    since we’re going to make it ourselves. So have no worries about us on your
                    part, and catch your breath, too, which you’ll darned well need. For my part,
                    I’d wish just to ask you too that I’m asking for no more than to continue at a
                    very ordinary sum per month of 150 (and the same for Gauguin). <stress
                        reason="money">Which in any case reduces my personal spending.</stress>
                    While his paintings will certainly go up. Later, then, if you keep my paintings
                    for yourself, either in Paris or here, I’ll be much happier to be able to say
                    bluntly that you prefer to keep my work for us than to sell it, than to have to
                    get involved in the struggle for money at this moment. Most certainly. Besides,
                    if what I do is good, then we’ll lose nothing by it, in terms of money, because,
                    like wine that you would have in the cellar, it would quietly ferment. On the
                    other hand, it’s only fair that I give myself a little trouble to make a
                    painting such that even from the point of view of the money, it was preferable
                    that it should be on my canvas rather than in the tubes.</p>
                <p>Now in closing I dare hope that in 6 months’ time Gauguin, you and I, we’ll see
                    that we’ve founded a little studio that will last and that will continue to be
                    an essential stopping-off point or station, useful at least to all those who’ll
                    wish to see the south.</p>
            </body>
            <close>I shake your hand very firmly.</close>
            <sig>Ever yours, Vincent</sig>
            <ps>
                <p>I don’t yet know what Gauguin thinks about my decoration in general; I only know
                    that there are some studies that he really does like, namely, the Sower, the
                    Sunflowers, the Bedroom. And the whole thing, I don’t know anything about it
                    myself yet, because I need more canvases of the other seasons. Gauguin has
                    already just about found his Arlésienne, and I could wish that I too had got as
                    far. But for my part, I find the landscape here very easily, and quite varied.
                    So at last my little work potters along. I dare believe that you’ll like the new
                    Sower. I’m writing in haste, we have heaps of work. He and I plan to go to the
                    brothels a lot, but only to study them.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Gauguin’s canvas, Breton Children, has arrived, and he’s altered it very, very
                    well. But although I quite like this canvas, it’s all the better that it should
                    be sold, since the two he’s going to send you from here are thirty times better.
                    I’m speaking of the women picking grapes and the woman with the pigs. The reason
                    for this is that G. is beginning to overcome his liver or stomach trouble that
                    has bothered him lately. Now I’m writing to you in reply to what you were
                    telling me, that you would frame a small canvas of a pink peach tree I think, to
                    place it with those gentlemen. I don’t want to leave any doubt about what I
                    think of that. First, if you yourself would like to place either a bad or good
                    thing of mine there, my word if that will make you happier, then of course you
                    have and will have carte blanche either now or later. But if, on the other hand,
                    it’s either for my pleasure or for my own benefit, I’d be of the opinion that
                    it’s completely unnecessary. If you were to ask me what would give me pleasure,
                    it’s quite simply one single thing, that you keep for yourself what you like
                    from what I do, in the apartment, and that you don’t sell any of it now. The
                    rest, the stuff that gets in the way, send it to me here for this good reason,
                    that everything I’ve done from nature is chestnuts pulled out of the fire.
                    Gauguin, in spite of himself and in spite of me, has proved to me a little that
                    it was time for me to vary things a bit – I’m beginning to compose from memory,
                    and all my studies will still be useful to me for that work, as they remind me
                    of former things I’ve seen. So what does selling any of it matter if we’re not
                    absolutely pressed for money? For in addition, I’m sure even now that you’ll
                    eventually see things that way.</p>
                <p>As for you, you’re with the Goupils, but I certainly am not, after however
                    working there for 6 years we were absolutely dissatisfied on both sides with
                    everything, them with me, me with them. It’s an old story, but all the same
                    that’s how it is. So continue on your way, but as far as the business is
                    concerned it seems to me incompatible with my previous behaviour to come back
                    there with a canvas of such innocence as this little peach tree or some other
                    thing like it. No. If in a year or two I have enough to make an exhibition of my
                    own, let’s say thirty or so no. thirty canvases — And if I said to them, will
                    you do it for me, Boussod would certainly send me packing. Knowing them alas a
                    little too well, I think that I won’t approach them. Not that I’d ever try to
                    ruin anything, on the contrary, you must admit that I urge on all the others
                    there zealously. But as for me, my word I have an old grudge against them. Be
                    sure and certain that I consider you, as a seller of Impressionist paintings, to
                    be very independent of the Goupils, that it will therefore always be a pleasure
                    for me to urge artists to go there. <stress reason="environment">But I don’t
                        want Boussod ever to have a chance to say ‘this little canvas isn’t too bad
                        for this young beginner’,</stress> as if never before... On the contrary, I
                    won’t come back to them, I’d prefer never to sell than to enter into it other
                    than very straightforwardly. Now they’re not people to act straightforwardly, so
                    it isn’t worth beginning again. Be assured that the more clear-cut we are about
                    this the more they’ll come to you to see them. You don’t sell them, so in
                    showing my work you aren’t trading outside the firm of Boussod, V. &amp; Cie.
                    Thus you’re acting honestly, and that’s worthy of respect. If one or the other
                    wants to buy however, fine, all they have to do is approach me directly. But be
                    sure of this: if we can withstand the siege my day will come. I cannot and must
                    not at this moment do anything other than work. One thing however perhaps, I’m
                    going to reply to Jet Mauve, tell her a whole heap of things about Gauguin
                    &amp;c. &amp;c., send her some croquis, and indirectly Tersteeg will prick up
                    his ears again. </p>
                <p>Gauguin and I often talk about the need to hold exhibitions in London, and
                    perhaps we’ll send you a letter for Tersteeg to read. The thing is, should
                    Tersteeg have an energetic successor — that day is approaching — the latter
                    won’t be able to work with anything but new paintings. Handshake — we’ll need
                    some more colours. <unstress reason="money">I must also tell you that the month
                        with the two of us together is going better on 150 each than I did on 250
                        just for myself. At the end of a year you’ll notice that this is working
                        after all.</unstress> I can’t say anything more yet. I rather regret having
                    the room full of canvases and having nothing to send when Gauguin sends his. The
                    thing is, regarding the impasto things, Gauguin has told me how to get rid of
                    the grease by washing them from time to time. What’s more, when that’s done I
                    must work on them again to retouch them. If I sent you any of them now, their
                    colour would be duller than it will be later. They all think that what I’ve sent
                    was done too hastily. I wouldn’t deny it, and I’ll make certain changes. It does
                    me enormous good to have company as intelligent as Gauguin and to see him work.
                    You’ll see that certain people are going to reproach G. for no longer doing
                    Impressionism. His two latest canvases which you’re going to see are very firm
                    in the impasto, there’s even some work with the knife in them. And that will put
                    his Breton canvases into the shade a little, not all, but some of them. I hardly
                    have the time to write, otherwise I’d already have written to those
                    Dutchmen.</p>
                <p>I’ve had a letter from Boch, you know that Belgian who has a sister in the
                    Vingtistes. He’s enjoying working up there. I really hope that we’ll always
                    remain friends with Gauguin, and in business with him, and if he succeeds in
                    setting up a tropical studio that would be magnificent. But that will take more
                    money by my calculations than by his. Guillaumin has written to Gauguin, he
                    seems very hard up but must have done some fine work. He has a child now, but he
                    was terrified by the confinement and says he’ll always have ‘the red vision’ of
                    it before his eyes. Only Gauguin has replied to him very well, saying that he,
                    G., had seen it 6 times. Jet Mauve is in much better health, and as you perhaps
                    know has been living in The Hague since last August, near the Jewish cemetery,
                    so almost in the country. You won’t lose anything by waiting a little while for
                    my work, and we’ll calmly leave our dear pals to scorn the present ones.
                    Fortunately for me I know what I want better than they believe and am,
                    basically, extremely indifferent to the criticism of working hurriedly. <work
                        origin="new" stage="finished">In reply I’ve produced work these last few
                        days even more hurriedly.</work> Gauguin was telling me the other day — that
                    he’d seen a painting by Claude Monet of sunflowers in a large Japanese vase,
                    very fine. But — he likes mine better. I’m not of that opinion — only don’t
                    think that I’m weakening. I regret as always, as you know, the scarcity of
                    models, the thousand obstacles to overcome that difficulty. If I were a
                    completely different man and if I were wealthier I could force it, at present
                    I’m not giving up and am plodding on quietly. If at the age of forty I do a
                    painting of figures like the flowers Gauguin was talking about I’ll have a
                    position as an artist alongside anything. So, perseverance. In the meantime I
                    can tell you anyway that the last two studies are rather funny. <work
                        origin="new" stage="finished">No. 30 canvases, a wooden and straw chair all
                        yellow on red tiles against a wall (daytime). Then Gauguin’s armchair, red

                    sailcloth in thick impasto. What I say about sending back studies, there’s no
                    hurry at all, and I’m referring to the bad ones which, however, will serve me as
                    documents — or those that are cluttering up your apartment. As to what I say in
                    general about the studies, I’m set on just one thing: that the position is quite
                    clear. Don’t trade on my behalf outside the firm; as for me, either I’ll never
                    return to the Goupils, which is more than likely, or I’ll return
                    straightforwardly, which is quite impossible.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Thanks for your kind letter and for the 100-franc note it contained. Am very
                    happy that Gauguin’s success as regards selling continues. If in a year’s time
                    he could have made enough to carry out his plan of going and setting himself up
                    in Martinique, I’d think that his fortune would be made. Only, to my mind he
                    shouldn’t risk going back there before he has 5 thousand put aside, according to
                    him he would need 2,000. But then to my mind he wouldn’t leave alone but with
                    one other or several others, and would found a lasting studio there. Anyhow, a
                    lot more water will flow under the bridge before then. What you write about the
                    Dutchmen interests me greatly. I hope one day to get to know both of them
                    personally. How old are they? I dare to believe that in the final reckoning
                    they’ll feel their coming to France was a good thing. The trouble they’re having
                    with colour — my goodness — that doesn’t surprise me. May De Haan never lose
                    touch with the serious study of Rembrandt, to which the two drawings of his that
                    I’m currently looking at testify! Have they read Silvestre’s book on E.
                    Delacroix, and the article on colour in C. Blanc’s Grammaire des arts du dessin?
                    So ask them that on my behalf, and if they haven’t read it they should.</p>
                <p>As for me, I think more about Rembrandt than may appear from my studies. <work
                        origin="new" stage="sketch">Here’s a croquis </work>of the latest <work
                        origin="new" stage="middle">canvas I’m working on, another sower</work>.
                    Immense lemon yellow disc for the sun. Green-yellow sky with pink clouds. The
                    field is violet, the sower and the tree Prussian Blue. No. 30 canvas. Let’s
                    calmly wait to exhibit until I have around thirty no. 30 canvases. Then we’ll
                    exhibit them once in your apartment for the friends, and not exerting any
                    pressure even then. And let’s not do anything else. There are lots of reasons
                    for not stirring now. Besides, it won’t take long, I think I’ll be able to send
                    it to you at the time of the exhibition or a little later. In the meantime it
                    will dry thoroughly here, and I can go over all the canvases again once they’re
                    thoroughly dry, even the impasted areas. If at the age of forty I do a painting
                    of figures or portraits the way I feel it, I think that will be worth more than
                    a more or less serious success now.</p>
                <p>Have you seen the studies that Bernard brought back from Brittany? Gauguin has
                    told me many things about them. He himself has one which is simply masterly. I
                    think that buying one from him, from Bernard, would be doing him a service, and
                    that he really deserves it. Only we mustn’t forget that either at New Year or in
                    March, Gauguin will have to be repaid the money he may have laid out, for
                    example for sheets or things that would remain in the studio. For on both sides
                    I think we’ll find it best to change nothing, absolutely nothing, in the
                    financial arrangement we’ve established. If at the end of a year we continue to
                    find it satisfactory, time will tell. Gauguin’s working on a very beautiful
                    painting of washerwomen, and also a big still life of an orange pumpkin and some
                    apples and white linen on a yellow background and foreground. <unstress
                        reason="environment">The weather here is cold, but we see some really
                        beautiful things all the same. </unstress>Such as yesterday evening, a
                    sickly lemon yellow sunset, mysterious, of extraordinary beauty — Prussian blue
                    cypresses, trees with dead leaves in every broken tone against that, not half
                    bad. You couldn’t imagine how pleased I am that you have painters with you and
                    aren’t staying alone in the apartment, <good_health>just as I too am very
                        pleased to have such good company as Gauguin’s.</good_health>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Yesterday Gauguin and I went to Montpellier to see the museum there, and
                    especially the Bruyas room — there are many portraits of Bruyas, by Delacroix,
                    by Ricard, by Courbet, by Cabanel, by Couture, by Verdier, by Tassaert, by
                    others too. After that there are paintings by Delacroix, Courbet, Giotto, Paul
                    Potter, Botticelli, T. Rousseau, very fine.</p>
                <p>Bruyas was a benefactor to artists, and this is all I’ll say to you: in the
                    Delacroix portrait, he’s a gentleman with a beard, red hair, who looks damnably
                    like you or me, and who made me think of that poem by Musset... everywhere I
                    touched the earth, an unfortunate man dressed in black came to sit beside us, a
                    man who looked at us like a brother. It would have the same effect on you, I’m
                    sure.</p>
                <p> I’d really ask you to go and see, at that bookshop where they sell lithographs
                    of ancient and modern artists, if you could manage to get the lithograph after
                    Delacroix’s ‘Tasso in the madhouse’ without great expense, since it would seem
                    to me that this figure (by Delacroix) must have some relationship to this fine
                    Bruyas portrait. </p>
                <p>They have other Delacroixs there, a study of a mulatto woman (which Gauguin once
                    copied), the Odalisques, Daniel in the lions’ den.</p>
                <p>By Courbet, first, The village girls, magnificent, a nude woman seen from the
                    back, another on the ground, in a landscape. Second, The woman spinning
                    (superb), and a whole load more Courbets. Anyway, you must know that this
                    collection exists, or else know people who have seen it, and consequently be
                    able to talk about it. So I shan’t insist on the museum (except for the Barye
                    drawings and bronzes!)</p>
                <p>Gauguin and I talk a lot about Delacroix, Rembrandt &amp;c.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="friendship">The discussion is excessively electric. We
                        sometimes emerge from it with tired minds, like an electric battery after
                        it’s run down.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>We’ve been right in the midst of magic, for as Fromentin says so well, Rembrandt
                    is above all a magician and Delacroix a man of God, of God’s thunder and bugger
                    off in the name of God. </p>
                <p>I’m writing this to you with reference to our friends, the Dutchmen De Haan and
                    Isaäcson, who have so sought and loved Rembrandt, in order to encourage you to
                    pursue the researches.</p>
                <p>One mustn’t get discouraged about that. You know the strange and superb portrait
                    of a man by Rembrandt at the La Caze gallery, I told Gauguin that, for me, I saw
                    in it a certain family or racial resemblance to Delacroix, or to him,
                    Gauguin.</p>
                <p>I don’t know why, but I always call that portrait ‘the traveller’ or ‘the man
                    coming from far away’.</p>
                <p>That’s an equivalent and parallel idea to what I’ve already told you, always to
                    look at the portrait of old Six. The fine portrait with the glove for your
                    future, and the Rembrandt etching, Six reading by a window in a ray of sunlight,
                    for your past and your present.</p>
                <p>That’s the stage we’re at.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="friendship">Gauguin said to me this morning, when I asked him
                        how he felt: ‘that he could feel his old self coming back’, which gave me
                        great pleasure.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <bad_health>As for me, coming here last winter, tired and almost fainting
                        mentally, I too suffered a little inside before I was able to begin to
                        remake myself.</bad_health>
                </p>
                <p>How I’d like you to see that museum in Montpellier some day, there are some
                    really beautiful things there!</p>
                <p>Say so to Degas, that Gauguin and I have been to see the portrait of Bruyas by
                    Delacroix at Montpellier, for we must boldly believe that what is, is, and the
                    portrait of Bruyas by Delacroix resembles you and me like a new brother.</p>
                <p>As regards setting up a life with painters as pals, you see such odd things and
                    I’ll end with what you always say, time will tell.</p>
                <p>You can tell all this to our friends Isaäcson and De Haan, and even boldly read
                    them this letter, I would already have written to them if I’d felt the necessary
                    electric force.</p>
                <p>On behalf of Gauguin as well as myself, a good, hearty handshake to you all.</p>

                <p>If you think that Gauguin or I have a facility in our work, the work isn’t always
                    accommodating. And for the Dutchmen not to get discouraged in their difficulties
                    any more than we do, that’s what I wish for them, and for you too.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Even before receiving (this very moment) your kind letter, I received a letter
                    from your fiancée this morning announcing the engagement. So I’ve already
                    replied to her with my sincere congratulations, as I repeat them here to
                    you.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="family">My fear that my indisposition might prevent your very
                        necessary journey, which I’ve hoped for so much and for so long</unstress>
                    <good_health>— now that this fear has disappeared I feel completely
                        normal.</good_health>
                </p>
                <p>This morning I went to the hospital again to have my wound dressed, and walked
                    for an hour and a half with the house physician, and we talked a little about
                    everything, even natural history.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="friendship">What you tell me about Gauguin gives me enormous
                        pleasure, that’s to say that he hasn’t abandoned his plan to return to the
                        tropics. That’s the right path for him. I think I can see clearly into his
                        plan, and I approve of it with all my heart. Naturally I have regrets about
                        it, but you can understand that provided it goes well for him that’s all I
                        need.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>If you can do so, talk a little to C.M. about the future of his business and the
                    fact that his son can continue it, provided C.M. himself does his full duty as
                    regards listening to you and putting you and his son together. All the same C.M.
                    must wish that the firm he founded continues — hasn’t he introduced into Holland
                    the very artists who were not with the Goupils, &amp;c. &amp;c.?</p>
                <p>Then Tersteeg must admit the Impressionists, or at least believe in E. Delacroix,
                    and then Tersteeg and you joining hands would be a great force that Boussod
                    would have to reckon with.</p>
                <p>What is the 89 exhibition going to be?</p>
                <p>Don’t forget The anatomy lesson for Mr Rey. He had already told me before this
                    morning that he likes painting, although he knows little about it, and that he
                    would like to learn. I told him that he should become an art lover but that he
                    shouldn’t try to do painting himself. This means that perhaps we’ll find 2
                    doctor friends here, Rey and the Parisian doctor I spoke to you about
                    before.</p>
                <p>I told them that Bruyas of Montpellier shares a certain family characteristic
                    with the two of us, and that we’re therefore simply continuing what Monticelli
                    and Bruyas began in the south.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="money">When I came out of the hospital I had quite a few things
                        to pay, and while they aren’t at all urgent for a few days, I’d be pleased
                        if you could send me about fifty francs within the next few days.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="friendship">The mistake in pal Gauguin’s calculations was, in my
                        opinion, that he’s a little too accustomed to closing his eyes to the
                        inevitable expenses of house rental, charwoman and a whole heap of earthly
                        things of that kind. Now, all these things weigh a little heavily on the
                        shoulders of the two of us.</stress> But once we bear them, other artists
                    could lodge with me without having those costs. </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="money">I’ve just been told that in my absence the owner of my
                        house here apparently made a contract with a fellow who has a tobacco shop,
                        to turn me out and give him, the tobacconist, the house.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>That worries me a little, for I’m not much inclined to have myself turned out of
                    this house almost shamefully when it was I who had it repainted inside and out
                    and had gas put in &amp;c., in short who made habitable a house that had been
                    locked up and uninhabited for quite a long time, and which I took on in very
                    poor condition. This is to warn you that perhaps at Easter, for example, if the
                    owner persists, I’ll ask you for advice about it, and that in all of this I
                    consider myself merely an agent, defending the interests of our artist
                    friends.</p>
                <p>Besides, it’s more than likely that water will flow under the bridge between now
                    and then. And the main thing is not to worry about it.</p>
                <p>Has Bernard returned the Silvestre book to you yet? I’ll need the exact title to
                    get those doctors to read this book.</p>
                <p>Physically I am well, the wound is closing very well and the great loss of blood
                    is balancing out, since I’m eating and digesting well. <bad_health>The most
                        fearsome thing is the insomnia, and the doctor didn’t talk to me about it,
                        nor have I spoken to him about it yet. But I’m fighting it
                        myself.</bad_health>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <good_health>I’m fighting this insomnia with a very, very strong dose of camphor
                        in my pillow and my mattress, and I recommend it to you if you ever have
                        trouble sleeping. I was very fearful of sleeping alone in the house, and I
                        felt anxious that I wouldn’t be able to sleep, but it went very well and I
                        dare to believe that it won’t recur.</good_health>
                </p>
                <p>My suffering in that way in the hospital was appalling, and yet in the midst of
                    it all, though I was more than insensible, I can tell you as a curiosity that I
                    kept thinking about Degas.</p>
                <p>Gauguin and I had talked about Degas before, and I pointed out to Gauguin that
                    Degas had said this:... ‘I’m saving myself for the Arlésiennes.’</p>
                <p>Now, you who know how subtle Degas is, once you’re back in Paris, tell Degas that
                    I admit to you that up until now I’ve been powerless to paint them as other than
                    poisonous, the women of Arles, and that he mustn’t believe Gauguin if Gauguin
                    says good things too soon about my work, which has only been done under the
                    influence of illness.</p>
                <p>Now, if I recover I must start again, and I can’t again attain those peaks to
                    which sickness imperfectly led me.</p>
                <p>I would very much have liked to give another painting to Rivet precisely because
                    I wholly agree with you that it would be good to put Mr Rey in touch with
                    Rivet.</p>
                <p>But you could indeed tell Rivet that it would be good to send Mr Rey back here to
                    the hospital with the doctor’s qualification he’s going to try and get. He’s
                    very, very useful here, and we’ll darned well be in need of doctors again here
                    in Arles in days to come, as long as cholera and the plague &amp;c. continue to
                    menace the area around Marseille. Now Rey was born here and would be worthless
                    in Paris or elsewhere, while once he was armed with the full medical power of
                    Paris, </p>
                <p> he could perform real miracles here in a time of calamity.</p>
                <p>Of course we have no right to get involved in the question of medicine, only
                    Rivet himself will perhaps be of the same opinion as regards the feeling that an
                    Arlesian isn’t a Parisian and vice versa.</p>
                <p>Did you pass through Breda, I’m naturally inclined to think so. Above all,
                    reassure Mother about me.</p>
                <p>Have you seen the portrait of me that Gauguin has, and have you seen the portrait
                    that Gauguin did of himself during those final days?</p>
                <p>If you were to compare this portrait which Gauguin did of himself then with the
                    one I still have of him, which he sent to me from Brittany in exchange for mine,
                    you would see that all in all he grew more serene here, personally. </p>
                <p>What have De Haan and Isaäcson been doing? <stress reason="money">I had vaguely
                        hoped to see them here one day had Gauguin himself stayed longer with me,
                        and with a view to that I’d even rented two little rooms which were coming
                        vacant in the house which I currently have the whole of (the rent is 21.50
                        francs a month). I daren’t press the point any more, seeing as Gauguin has
                        gone, especially when one considers that the journey to the south costs
                        quite a lot.</stress> Anyway, give them my kind regards when you see them
                    again.</p>
                <p>Roulin sends his warm regards, he was very pleased with what you said about him
                    in your letter today, and besides, he amply deserves it.</p>
                <p>Handshake, and naturally you’ll feel how much I wish you good days with your
                    fiancée.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>I must write you another line today. Yesterday they also presented the gas bill
                    for ten francs (or 9.90), which I also paid.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="money">That, added to the accounts I did for you in my previous
                        letter, reduces to very, very little what I have left of the 50franc note to
                        feed myself. If you can, send me a bit more, I’ve explained everything about
                        it clearly enough, I hope.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>I’m still very weak, and I’ll have difficulty in regaining my strength if the
                    cold continues. Rey will give me some quinine wine, which I dare believe will
                    have some effect.</p>
                <p>
                    <work mention="vague">I would have a lot more things to say to you in response
                        to your letter, but I have a painting on the easel and am in a hurry.</work>
                </p>
                <p>You hadn’t told me yet, before now, that André Bonger was married. It can’t be
                    very jolly when he complains about the high cost of running a home. Jo Bonger
                    wrote me a line in response to the fact that I had congratulated her, that’s
                    very kind of her. It has always seemed to me that you owed it to your social
                    position and to the one you have in the family to marry, and it has been
                    Mother’s wish for years.</p>
                <p>And by doing thus what you must do, you’ll perhaps have more tranquillity than
                    before, even amidst a thousandandone difficulties.</p>
                <p>
                    <bad_health>However, life isn’t easy for me either. </bad_health>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="family">What wouldn’t I have given to be able to spend a day
                        here with you and to show you the work in progress and the house, &amp;c.
                        &amp;c.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>Now I would prefer that you hadn’t yet seen anything of what I have here than to
                    leave with an impression of it in such distressing conditions. Ah well.</p>
                <p>What is Guillaumin doing? You know he has a son now.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="friendship">Bernard is being pestered more and more by his
                        father, it’s becoming even more of a hell in that house.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>And the worst is that there isn’t much one can do about it, as soon as you put
                    your hand in there you put it into a real wasps’ nest.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="friendship">They’re now going to try, Gauguin and Bernard, to
                        exempt Bernard from military service because of narrowness (?) of the chest.
                        Good — but it would be a thousand times better for him if he did his service
                        straightforwardly in Algeria with Milliet.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>I’m becoming ridiculous as regards Milliet, because the latter constantly asks me
                    for news about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="friendship">Roulin is on the point of leaving. His salary here
                        was 135 francs a month, to raise 3 children with that and live on it,
                        himself and his wife! You can imagine what that was like. And that isn’t
                        all, the pay rise is a remedy worse than the ill itself... What a civil
                        service.</stress> And in what times we live. I’ve rarely seen a man of
                    Roulin’s stamp, there’s an enormous amount of Socrates in him, ugly as a satyr
                    as Michelet said... until on the last day a god was to be seen there, by whom
                    the Parthenon was illuminated, &amp;c. &amp;c. If Chatrian, whom you met, had
                    seen that man...</p>

                    <stress reason="money">Write to me at once at once. Please, because what you
                        sent was really not entirely sufficient, as I’ve tried to explain to you

                    <stress reason="friendship">I forget to say that yesterday I had a letter from
                        Gauguin, still about the fencing masks and gloves. Full of varying and
                        varied plans. And already he sees the end of his money on the
                        horizon.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>Naturally...</p>
                <p>He already fears not being able to go to Brussels for that reason. And after
                    that, if he can’t even go to Brussels, how will he go to Denmark and to the
                    tropics?</p>
                <p>The best thing he could still do and the very one which he won’t do. That would
                    be quite simply to return here.</p>
                <p>Anyway, we haven’t got to that yet, for he doesn’t yet tell me that he glimpses
                    penury on the horizon, only it’s more than readable between the lines.</p>
                <p>He’s still at the Schuffeneckers’ temporarily, and is going to do portraits of
                    the entire family. So he still has time to think things over.</p>
                <p>I haven’t replied to him yet.<unstress reason="friendship"> What is fortunately
                        certain is that I dare believe that at heart Gauguin and I like each other
                        enough as characters to be able to start over again together if
                        necessary.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>It gives me great pleasure that you haven’t forgotten The anatomy lesson for Mr
                    Rey. Later I myself will always have need of a doctor from time to time, and
                    precisely because he knows me well now would be one more reason for me to remain
                    quietly here.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="friendship">Although I have nothing very, very unexpected to
                        tell you I still want to let you know that last Monday I saw our friend
                        Roulin again.</unstress> There was good reason for it too — the whole of
                    France having shivered. Certainly in our own eyes the election and its results
                    and its representatives are only symbols. But one thing that has been proved
                    once again is that worldly ambitions and glories pass — but that up to now the
                    beating of the human heart remains the same and as much in touch with the past
                    of our buried fathers as with the generation to come.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="friendship">This morning I had a very friendly letter from
                        Gauguin to which I replied without delay.</unstress>
                    <work origin="existing" stage="finished">When Roulin came I had just finished
                        the repetition of my sunflowers, and I showed him the two examples of the
                        Berceuse between these four bouquets.</work>
                </p>
                <p>Roulin sends you his warm regards.</p>
                <p>On Sunday in Marseille he was present at the crowd’s demonstration when the
                    election result was telegraphed from Paris.</p>
                <p>Like Paris, Marseille was moved to the very depth of the depths of the souls of
                    the common people, all together and taciturn. Ah well, who will now dare order
                    any cannon, machine gun or Lebel rifle to fire when so many hearts have been
                    given in advance to serve as stoppers for the cannons?</p>
                <p>All the more so since certainly the victorious politicians of this great day
                    today, Rochefort and Boulanger, are with one common accord more ambitious for
                    the cemetery than for any throne.</p>
                <p>Anyhow, that was our interpretation of the event, not just Roulin’s and mine but
                    that of many others. We were very moved all the same. Roulin told me that he
                    almost wept when he saw that silent Marseille crowd, and that he hadn’t
                    recovered his composure until he turned round and saw some very, very old
                    friends, who hesitated to recognize him, by sheer chance. They then went off to
                    have supper together until late into the night. </p>
                <p>Although he was very tired he wasn’t able to resist the desire to come to Arles
                    to see his family again and, almost falling over with tiredness and very pale,
                    he came to shake our hands. <work mention="vague">I could just show him the two
                        examples of the portrait of his wife, which pleased him.</work>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <bad_health>From what people tell me I’m very obviously looking better; on the
                        inside my heart is a little too full of so many diverse emotions and hopes,
                        for it astonishes me that I’m getting better.</bad_health>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="friendship">Everyone here is good towards me, the neighbours
                        &amp;c., good and attentive as in one’s native country.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>I know already that several people here would ask me for portraits if they dared
                    ask for them. As Roulin, poor povertystricken devil and lowly employee as he is,
                    is held in very, very great esteem here, people found out that I had done all
                    his family.</p>
                <p>My dear brother, in times to come we may indeed fall into suffering again, into
                    errors, into misfortune, I don’t deny it.</p>
                <p>But we’ll always have worked in this 89 here with the French we love so much, as
                    on their side, too, they make us feel the fatherland. </p>
                <p> Now we have experienced that, at any rate.</p>
                <p>Don’t talk to your fiancée about this matter between us, leave me as I’ve asked
                    you, to work until the last day of March. <work origin="new" stage="planned">And
                        from now until then I’ll have done a few Impressionist canvases, come
                        on.</work>
                    <work origin="new" stage="middle">Today I started work on a third Berceuse. I do
                        know that it’s neither drawn nor painted as correctly as a Bouguereau, which
                        I almost regret, as I seriously have the desire to be correct — but although
                        it isn’t therefore fated to be a Cabanel or a Bouguereau, I yet hope that
                        it’s French.</work>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="environment">The weather today has been magnificent with no
                        wind, and I wanted so much to work that I’m astonished by it, as I hadn’t
                        expected it any more.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <bad_health>I’ll end this letter like the one to Gauguin by telling you that
                        there are indeed still signs of the previous overexcitement in my words, but
                        that there’s nothing surprising about that, since in this good Tarascon
                        country everyone is a touch cracked.</bad_health>
                </p>
                <p>Good handshake, to De Haan and Isaäcson as well.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="money">I would have preferred to reply to you immediately about
                        the very kind letter containing 100 francs,</stress>
                    <bad_health>but as I was very tired at that precise moment, and as the doctor
                        had absolutely ordered me to go for walks without mental work, because of
                        that it’s only today that I write to you.</bad_health> As for work, the
                    month hasn’t been bad after all, and the work distracts me, or rather keeps me
                    in order, so I don’t deprive myself of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <work origin="existing" stage="finished">I’ve done the Berceuse three times, now
                        since Mrs Roulin was the model and I was only the painter, I let her choose
                        between the three, her and her husband,</work>
                    <work origin="existing" stage="middle">only on condition that I’d do a
                        repetition for myself of the one she took, which I’m working on at
                        present.</work>
                </p>
                <p>You ask me if I’ve read Mistral’s Mireille – I’m like you, I can only read it in
                    fragments of the translation. But have you heard it yet, for perhaps you know
                    that Gounod has set it to music. I think so anyway. Naturally I don’t know this
                    music, and even if I was listening to it I would rather be looking at the
                    musicians than listening. </p>
                <p> But I can tell you this, that the original language from here in words sounds so
                    musical in the mouths of the Arlésiennes that my word yes, from time to time I
                    catch fragments of it.</p>
                <p>Perhaps in the Berceuse there’s an attempt at a little music of colour from here,
                    it’s badly painted, and chromos bought at the penny bazaar are infinitely better
                    painted technically, but all the same.</p>
                <p>Here – the socalled good town of Arles is a funny place which for good reasons
                    friend Gauguin calls the filthiest place in the south.</p>
                <p>Now Rivet, if he saw the population, would certainly be sorry at times, saying
                    over and over, ‘you’re all sick’ – as he says of us. But if you catch the local
                    sickness, my word, afterwards you won’t be able to catch it again.</p>
                <p>
                    <good_health>This is to tell you that as for myself, I don’t have any illusions.
                        It’s going very, very well and I’ll do everything that the doctor
                        says</good_health> but...</p>
                <p>
                    <bad_health>When I came out of the hospital with good Roulin I fancied that I
                        hadn’t had anything, only afterwards did I have the feeling that I’d been
                        ill. What can you say, I have moments when I’m twisted by enthusiasm or
                        madness or prophecy like a Greek oracle on her tripod.</bad_health>
                </p>
                <p>Then I have a great presence of mind in words and talk like the Arlésiennes, but
                    I feel so weak with all that. Especially when my physical powers return. But
                    I’ve already told Rey that at the slightest serious symptom I’d come back and
                    then subject myself to the alienist doctors of Aix or to himself.</p>
                <p>What else can it do to us but bad things, and only cause us pain, you and me, if
                    we aren’t well.</p>
                <p>Our ambition has sunk so low. So let’s work very calmly, look after ourselves as
                    much as we can and not wear ourselves out in sterile efforts at reciprocal
                    generosity.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="family">You’ll do your duty and I’ll do mine, as far as that’s
                        concerned both of us have already paid for it other than in words and, at
                        the end of the road, possibly we’ll see each other calmly again.</stress>
                    <bad_health>But myself, whereas in my delirium all things I love so much are in
                        turmoil, I can’t accept that as reality and am not acting the false
                        prophet.</bad_health>
                </p>
                <p>Sickness or mortality, my word, that doesn’t surprise me, but ambition isn’t
                    compatible, fortunately for us, with the professions we follow. </p>
                <p>Besides, there are so many people who think this way, in several categories of
                    society, from the highest to the lowest.</p>
                <p>But how come that you’re thinking about the little clauses of marriage and the
                    possibility of dying at this moment, wouldn’t you have done better quite simply
                    to have screwed your wife in advance? Anyway, that’s part of the customs of the
                    north, and I’m not the one to say they don’t have good customs in the north.</p>
                <p>It will come back, really.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="money">But as for me without a sou, in this case I still say
                        that money is one kind of currency and painting another.</stress>
                    <work mention="vague">And I’m already able to send you a consignment in the
                        sense mentioned in the previous writings. But it will get bigger if my
                        strength comes back to me.</work>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <work mention="vague">So I would like only, should Gauguin, who has a complete
                        infatuation with my sunflowers, take these two paintings from me, that he
                        gives your fiancée or you two of his paintings, not mediocre ones but better
                        than mediocre.</work> And if he takes a version of the Berceuse all the more
                    reason why he should also give something good on his part.</p>
                <p>Without that I couldn’t complete this series I was telling you about, which must
                    be able to go into the same little shop window we’ve looked into so often. </p>
                <p>The value of a painting in a case like this doesn’t come into it and I declare
                    that I’m no expert. It remains that my social position may be as dear to me as
                    yours as a good employee is to you.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="money">And let me say just this, I attach as much importance as
                        you do to a brotherly honesty as regards Boussod’s money. We have never
                        served it ill. And we’ve worn ourselves out too much to do the right thing
                        to be able to get angry at being called thieves or incompetents, what’s
                        more, I won’t go on about it.</stress>
                </p>
                <p> For the Independents, it seems to me that six paintings is too many by half.
                        <work mention="vague">To my taste the harvest and the white orchard are
                        enough, with the little Provençal girl or the sower if you want.</work> But
                    it’s all the same to me. I just really want one day to give you a more
                    consolatory impression in our trade of painting in which we work, by means of a
                    collection of around 30 more serious studies.</p>
                <p>In any case, that will prove to our real friends like Gauguin, Guillaumin,
                    Bernard &amp;c. that we’re engaged in the work of production. </p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="money">Ah well, as for the little yellow house, when I paid my
                        rent the landlord’s agent was very nice and behaved like an Arlesian,
                        treating me as an equal.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p> So I told him that I had no need of a lease, nor of a written statement of
                    intent, preferably in writing, and that in the case of illness I would only pay
                    by friendly agreement.</p>
                <p>Here the people have their hearts in the right place, and a spoken word is more
                    binding than a written one. So I’m keeping the house for the time being, since I
                    need to feel at home here for the sake of my mental recovery.</p>
                <p>Now as regards your move from rue Lepic to rue Rodier I can’t have an opinion,
                    not having seen it, but the main thing is precisely that you also lunch at home
                    with your wife. By staying in Montmartre you’ll be decorated and Minister for
                    Fine Arts more quickly, but as you don’t much care about that it’s better to
                    have tranquillity at home, so I think you’re completely right. </p>
                <p>I too am a little like that – to the local people who ask after my health I
                    always say that I’ll begin by dying of it with them and that afterwards my
                    sickness will be dead.</p>
                <p>That doesn’t mean to say that I won’t have considerable periods of respite.</p>
                <p>But once you’re seriously ill you well know that you can’t catch the sickness
                    twice, being healthy or sick is the same thing as being young or old.</p>
                <p>
                    <good_health>Only be well aware of the fact that like you, I’m doing what the
                        doctor tells me as much as I can. And that I consider that as a part of the
                        work and the duty one has to carry out.</good_health>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="friendship">I must say this, that the neighbours &amp;c. are
                        particularly kind towards me, everyone here suffering either from fever or
                        hallucinations or madness, we get along like members of the same

                <p>
                    <unstress reason="love">Yesterday I went back to see the girl I went to when I
                        went out of my mind. I was told there that things like that aren’t at all
                        surprising around here. She had suffered from it and had fainted but had
                        regained her composure. And what’s more, people say good things of
                        her.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <bad_health>But as to considering myself completely healthy, we shouldn’t do
                        it.</bad_health>
                </p>
                <p>The local people who are ill like me indeed tell me the truth. You can live to be
                    old or young, but you’ll always have moments when you lose your head.</p>
                <p>So I don’t ask you to say of me that there’s nothing wrong with me, or won’t
                    be.</p>
                <p>Only the Ricord of that is probably Raspail. I haven’t yet had the local fevers,
                    and I could still catch them too. But here they’re already wellversed in all
                    that at the hospital, and so from the moment when you have no false shame and
                    say frankly what you feel, you can’t go wrong.</p>
                <p>I’m closing this letter for this evening, with good handshake in thought.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>
                    <bad_health>As long as my mind was so out of sorts it would have been fruitless
                        to try and write to you to reply to your kind letter.</bad_health> Today
                    I’ve just returned home for the time being, I hope for good. <good_health>There
                        are so many moments when I feel completely normal, and actually it would
                        seem to me that, if what I have is only a sickness peculiar to this area, I
                        should wait quietly here until it’s over.</good_health> Even if it were to
                    happen again (which, let’s say, won’t be the case).</p>
                <p>But here is what I’m saying once and for all to you and to Mr Rey. If sooner or
                    later it were desirable that I should go to Aix, as has already been suggested –
                    I consent in advance and will submit to it.</p>
                <p>But in my capacity as painter and workman it isn’t permissible for anyone, not
                    even you or the doctor, to take such a course of action without warning me and
                    consulting me myself about it too, because as up to now I’ve always kept my
                    relative presence of mind for my work, it’s my right to say then </p>
                <p> (or at least to have an opinion on) what would be best, to keep my studio here
                    or to move completely to Aix. That in order to avoid the expenses and the losses
                    of a move as much as possible, and not to do it except in the event of an
                    absolute emergency.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="friendship">It appears that the people around here have a legend
                        that makes them afraid of painting and that people talked about that in the
                        town.</stress> Good. As for me, I know that it’s the same thing in Arabia,
                    and yet we have heaps of painters in Africa, don’t we? Which proves that with a
                    little firmness one can alter these prejudices, or at least do one’s painting
                    all the same. The unfortunate thing is that I’m rather inclined to be impressed,
                    to feel the beliefs of other people myself and not always to laugh at the
                    foundation of truth that there may be in the absurd.</p>
                <p>Besides, Gauguin is like that too, as you were able to observe, and was himself
                    also tired out at the time of his stay by some malaise or other.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="friendship">As I’ve already been staying here for more than a
                        year, and have heard people say pretty much all the bad things possible
                        about me, about Gauguin, about painting in general, why shouldn’t I take
                        things as they are and wait for the outcome here.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>Where can I go that’s worse than where I’ve already been twice – the isolation
                    cell. The advantages that I have here are, as Rivet would say – first – ‘they’re
                    all sick’ here, and so at least I don’t feel alone.</p>
                <p>Then, as you well know, I love Arles so much, although Gauguin is darned right to
                    call it the filthiest town in all of the south.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="friendship">And I’ve found so much friendship already from the
                        neighbours, from Mr Rey, from everyone at the hospital for that matter, that
                        really I’d prefer to be always ill here than to forget the kindness there is
                        in the same people who have the most incredible prejudices towards painters
                        and painting, or in any case have no clear and healthy idea whatsoever about
                        it as we do.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>Then at the hospital they know me now, and if this were to come on again it would
                    pass in silence, and at the hospital they’d know what to do. I have absolutely
                    no desire to be treated by other doctors, nor do I feel the need for it. </p>
                <p>The only desire I might have is to be able to continue to earn with my own hands
                    what I spend.</p>
                <p>Koning has written me a very kind letter, saying that he and a friend would
                    probably come to the south with me for a long time. That in response to a letter
                    I wrote him a few days ago. I no longer dare to urge painters to come here after
                    what has happened to me, they run the risk of losing their heads like me. The
                    same thing for De Haan and Isaäcson.</p>
                <p> Let them go to Antibes, Nice, Menton, it’s perhaps healthier.</p>
                <p>Mother and our sister also wrote to me, the latter was very upset about the sick
                    woman she was caring for. At home they’re very pleased about your marriage.</p>
                <p>Be well aware that you mustn’t preoccupy yourself with me too much, nor fret
                    yourself.</p>
                <p>It must probably run its course, and we couldn’t change very much about our fate
                    with precautions.</p>
                <p>Once again, let’s try to seize our fate in whatever form it comes. Our sister
                    wrote to me that your fiancée would come to stay with them for a while. That is
                    well done. Ah well, I shake your hand most heartily, and let us not be
                    discouraged. Believe me</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>On the occasion of the first of May I wish you not too bad a year, and above all
                    good health.</p>
                <p>How I’d like to be able to pass on some physical strength to you, I have a
                    feeling of having too much of it at the moment. <bad_health>Which doesn’t
                        prevent my mind from not yet being at all what it ought to be.</bad_health>
                </p>
                <p>How right Delacroix was, who lived on bread and wine alone, and who succeeded in
                    finding a way of life in harmony with his profession. <stress reason="money">But
                        the inevitable question of money always remains – Delacroix had a private
                        income. Corot too.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>And Millet – Millet was a peasant and the son of a peasant. You’ll perhaps read
                    with some interest the article I’m cutting out of a Marseille newspaper, because
                    in it one glimpses Monticelli, and I find the description of the painting of a
                    corner of the cemetery extremely interesting. But alas, it’s another
                    stilllamentable story.</p>
                <p>How sad it is to think that a painter who succeeds, even half succeeds, in his
                    turn pulls along half a dozen artists who are even greater failures than
                    himself.</p>
                <p>However, think of Pangloss, think of Bouvard and Pécuchet, I know, then even that
                    can be explained, but those people perhaps don’t know Pangloss, or else one
                    forgets everything one knows about him under the inevitable bite of real
                    despairs and great pains.</p>
                <p>And what’s more, under the name of optimism we fall back into a religion which to
                    me has the look of being the rear end of a kind of Buddhism. Nothing bad about
                    that, quite the opposite, if you like.</p>
                <p>I don’t much like the article on Monet in Le Figaro, how much better that other
                    article in Le 19ième Siècle was! There one saw the paintings, and this one
                    contains only banalities that make me melancholy. </p>
                <p>
                    <work mention="vague">Today I’m packing up a crate of paintings and
                        studies.</work>
                </p>
                <p>There’s one which is flaking, onto which I’ve stuck newspapers – it’s one of the
                    best and I think that when you look at it you’ll see more clearly what my
                    studio, now foundered, could have been. This study, as well as a few others, was
                    spoiled by damp during my illness.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="environment">The water from a flood rose up to a few feet from
                        the house and, more importantly, when I came back water and saltpetre were
                        oozing from the walls because the house had been without a fire during my
                        absence.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="career">That had an effect on me, not only the studio having
                        foundered, but even the studies which would have been the memories of it
                        damaged, it’s so final, and my urge to found something very simple but
                        durable was so strong.</stress>
                    <bad_health>It was fighting against insurmountable odds, or rather it was
                        weakness of character on my part, for I still have feelings of grave remorse
                        difficult to define. I think that was the cause of my crying out so much
                        during the crises, that I wanted to defend myself and could no longer manage
                        to.</bad_health> For it wasn’t for me, it was for the very painters like the
                    unfortunate one spoken of in the enclosed article that this studio could have
                    been of use.</p>
                <p>Anyway, there have been more than us before, Bruyas in Montpellier gave an entire
                    fortune to it and an entire existence and without the least apparent result.</p>
                <p>Yes – a cold room in a municipal museum where one sees a deeply saddened face and
                    lots of fine paintings, where certainly one is moved, but alas moved as in a
                    cemetery. </p>
                <p>However, it would be difficult for one to walk in a cemetery demonstrating more
                    clearly the existence of that Hope that Puvis de Chavannes painted.</p>
                <p>The paintings fade like flowers – thus even some Delacroixs had suffered, the
                    magnificent Daniel, the Odalisques (quite different from those in the Louvre, it
                    was in a single purplish range), but how that impressed me, those paintings that
                    were fading there, little understood, it’s true, by the majority of visitors who
                    look at Courbet and Cabanel and Victor Giraud &amp;c.</p>
                <p>What are we, we painters? Well, I think that Richepin is often right, for
                    example, when going at it pointblank he simply sends them back to the madhouse
                    in his blasphemies.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="money">Now, though, I assure you that I know no hospital where
                        one would want to take me for nothing, even supposing that I would take upon
                        myself the expenses of my painting and would leave all my work to the
                        hospital.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>And that is perhaps, I don’t say a great but anyway a small injustice. I would be
                    resigned if I thought that. <unstress reason="family">If I was without your
                        friendship I would be sent back without remorse to suicide, and however
                        cowardly I am, I would end up going there.</unstress>
                    <bad_health>There, as you will see I hope, is the point where we’re permitted to
                        protest against society and to defend ourselves.</bad_health>
                </p>
                <p>You can be reasonably sure that the Marseille artist who committed suicide did
                    not at all commit suicide from drinking absinthe, for the simple reason that
                    nobody will have offered him any and that he wouldn’t have had </p>
                <p> the means to buy any. Besides, it won’t have been solely for his pleasure that
                    he drank, but because being ill already he kept himself going that way.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="career">Mr Salles has been to StRémy – they don’t want to allow
                        me painting outside the establishment,</stress>
                    <stress reason="money">nor to take me for less than 100 francs.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>So this information is bad indeed. If I could get out of it by enlisting for 5
                    years in the Foreign Legion, I think I’d prefer that.</p>
                <p>For on the one hand being locked up, not working I would recover with difficulty,
                    on the other hand we’d be made to pay 100 francs a month all through a madman’s
                    long life.</p>
                <p>It’s serious, and what can one do, let’s think about it. But will they want to
                    take me on as a soldier? I feel very tired by the conversation with Mr Salles,
                    and I don’t quite know what to do. I myself advised Bernard to do his military
                    service, so is it so astonishing that I should think of going to Arabia myself
                    as a soldier.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="family">I say this just in case; you shouldn’t blame me too much
                        if I go. The rest is so vague and so strange</stress>. <stress
                        reason="money">And you know how doubtful it is that one ever recovers what
                        it costs to do painting.</stress> Besides, it seems to me that physically I
                    am well.</p>
                <p>If I can’t work there except under supervision! and in the establishment – is it
                    by God worth paying money for that!</p>
                <p>Certainly in the barracks I could then work as well and even better.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I’m thinking, do the same, let’s be aware that everything always happens
                    for the best in the best of worlds, that isn’t impossible. I shake your hand
                    very firmly.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Your kind letter did me good today, my word – let’s go for StRémy then, but I
                    tell you one more time, if after due consideration and consultation with the
                    doctor it would be perhaps either necessary or simply useful and wise to enlist,
                    let’s consider that with the same eye as the rest, and without prior prejudice
                    against it. That’s all. For dismiss the idea of sacrifice in it – I was writing
                    to our sister the other day that throughout my life, or almost at least, I’ve
                    sought something other than a martyr’s career, of which I’m not capable.</p>
                <p>If I find annoyance or cause it, my word I remain stunned by it. Certainly I
                    would gladly respect, I would admire martyrs &amp;c., but you must know that in
                    Bouvard et Pécuchet, for example, quite simply there is some other thing that
                    adapts itself more to our little existences.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I’m packing my trunk, and probably Mr Salles will go there with me as
                    soon as he can.</p>
                <p>Ah, what you said about Puvis and Delacroix is darned right, those fellows have
                    well demonstrated what painting could be, but let’s not confuse things when
                    there are immense distances. <stress reason="career">Now, myself as a painter,
                        I’ll never signify anything important, I sense it absolutely. Supposing
                        everything were changed, character, upbringing, circumstances, then this or
                        that could have existed. But we’re too positive to confuse. I sometimes
                        regret not having simply kept the Dutch palette of grey tones, and brushed
                        landscapes in Montmartre without pressing the point.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>Also, I’m thinking of beginning to draw more with the reed pen again which, like
                    last year’s views of Montmajour, is less expensive and distracts me just as
                    much. <work origin="new" stage="finished">Today I’ve made one of those drawings
                        which became very dark and quite melancholic for springtime,</work>
                    <unstress reason="career">but anyway, whatever happens to me and in whatever
                        circumstances I find myself, that’s something that I could keep as an
                        occupation for a long time, and in some way could even become a means of
                        earning a livelihood.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>Anyway, all in all what does it matter to you or to me to have a little more or a
                    little less annoyance.</p>
                <p>Certainly you joined up much earlier than I did, if we come to that, at the
                    Goupils’, where all in all you spent some pretty bad moments often enough, for
                    which you weren’t always thanked. And indeed you did it with zeal and devotion,
                    because then our father rather had his back to the wall with the big family at
                    the time, and it was necessary for you to throw yourself into it completely in
                    order to make everything work. I’ve thought again with much emotion of all these
                    old things during my illness.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="family">And in the end the main thing is to feel ourselves
                        closely united, and that hasn’t yet been disturbed.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="career">I have a certain hope that with what I know of my art
                        in total, a time will come when I’ll produce again, although in the
                        asylum.</unstress> What use would the more artificial life of an artist in
                    Paris be to me – one by which, all in all, I would only be half duped and for
                    which I consequently lack primitive enthusiasm, indispensable for launching
                    myself into it. Physically it’s amazing how well I am, but that isn’t enough of
                    a basis for going on believing that it’s the same mentally.</p>
                <p>I would happily, once I was known there a little, try and make myself a male
                    nurse little by little, in short to work at anything and take up an occupation
                    again – the first one that comes along.</p>
                <p>I’ll have terrible need of père Pangloss when it naturally comes about that I
                    become amorous again. Alcohol and tobacco have after all this good or bad point
                    – it’s a bit relative, this – that they’re antiaphrodisiacs, one should call it
                    that I think. Not always to be despised in the exercise of the fine arts.</p>
                <p>Anyway, that will be the ordeal in which one mustn’t forget completely how to
                    jest. For virtue and sobriety, I’m only too afraid, would lead me again into
                    those parts where usually I very quickly lose the compass completely, and where
                    this time I must try to have less passion and more bonhomie. </p>
                <p>The possible passionate thing is no great thing for me, although the power
                    remains, I dare believe, to feel oneself attached to the human beings with whom
                    one lives. How is père Tanguy – you must give him my warm regards.</p>
                <p>I hear in the newspapers that there are good things at the Salon. Listen – don’t
                    make yourself a completely exclusive Impressionist after all, if there’s good in
                    something let’s not lose sight of it. Certainly colour is making progress,
                    precisely by the Impressionists, even when they go astray. But Delacroix was
                    already more complete than they are.</p>
                <p>And my goodness, Millet, who has hardly any colour, what work his is!</p>
                <p>Madness is salutary for this, that one becomes perhaps less exclusive.</p>
                <p>I don’t regret having wanted to know a little technically about this question of
                    the theories of colours.</p>
                <p>As an artist one is merely a link in a chain, and whether you find or you don’t
                    find, you can console yourself with that.</p>
                <p>I’ve heard talk of a completely green interior with a green woman at the Salon
                    which people were saying good things about, as well as a portrait by Mathey, and
                    another by Besnard, ‘The siren’. People were also saying that there’s something
                    extraordinary by a fellow called Zorn, but they didn’t say what, and that there
                    was a CarolusDuran there, Triumph of Bacchus, bad. However, I still find his
                    ‘Lady with a glove’ in the Luxembourg so good; anyway, there are things that
                    aren’t serious that I like a lot, such as a book like Belami. And Carolus’s work
                    is a little like that. Our epoch has been like that, though, and all Badinguet’s
                    time too. And if a painter does as he sees, he always remains someone.</p>
                <p>Ah, to paint figures like Claude Monet paints landscapes. That’s what remains to
                    be done despite everything, and before, of necessity, one sees only Monet among
                    the Impressionists.</p>
                <p>For after all in figures, Delacroix, Millet, several sculptors have otherwise
                    done better than the Impressionists, and even J. Breton.</p>
                <p> Anyway, my dear brother, let’s be just, and I say to you as I retire, let’s
                    think, just when we’re getting too old to class ourselves with the young ones,
                    of what we have loved in our time, Millet, Breton, Israëls, Whistler, Delacroix,
                    Leys. And be fully assured that I myself am sufficiently convinced that I shan’t
                    see a future beyond that, nor moreover desire one.</p>
                <p>Now society is as it is, naturally we can’t wish for it to adapt itself just to
                    our personal needs. <bad_health>Anyway, however while finding it really really
                        good to go to StRémy, however with people like me it would really be more
                        just to stuff them into the legion.</bad_health> We can’t do anything about
                    it, but more than probably they’d refuse me there, at least here where my
                    adventure is too well known, and above all exaggerated. I say this very, very
                    seriously, physically I’m better than I have been for years and years, and I
                    could do military service. So let’s think again about that while going to
                    StRémy. I shake your hand heartily, and your wife’s too.</p>
            </body>
            <close>Ever yours,</close>
            <sig>Vincent</sig>
            <ps>
                <p>Ah, when I wrote to you that we mustn’t forget to appreciate what’s good in those
                    who aren’t Impressionists, I didn’t exactly mean to say that I was urging you to
                    admire the Salon beyond measure, but rather a heap of people like, for example,
                    Jourdan, who has just died in Avignon, Antigna, FeyenPerrin, all those whom we
                    knew so well before, when we were younger, why forget them or why attach no
                    importance to their presentday equivalents? Why are Daubigny and Quost and
                    Jeannin not colourists for example? So many distinctions in Impressionism do not
                    have the importance one wanted to see in them.</p>
                <p>Crinolines also had something pretty and consequently good about them, but anyway
                    the fashion was fortunately shortlived all the same. Not for some people.</p>
                <p>And thus we’ll always retain a certain passion for Impressionism, but I sense
                    that I’m returning more and more to the ideas I already had before coming to
                    Paris.</p>
                <p>Now that you’re married we no longer have to live for great ideas but, believe
                    it, for little ones only. And I find that a real relief which I don’t complain
                    about at all.</p>
                <p>(In my room I have the famous portrait of a man (the wood engraving) that you
                    know, a mandarin woman by Monorou (the large print from the Bing album), the
                    blade of grass (from the same album), the Pietà and the good Samaritan by
                    Delacroix, and Meissonier’s reader, then two large reed pen drawings.)</p>
                <p>At the moment I’m reading Balzac’s Le médecin de campagne, which is really fine,
                    in it there’s a character of a woman, not mad but too sensitive, who is really
                    charming, I’ll send it to you when I’ve finished it. Wil wrote me a kind letter,
                    still very firm and calm.</p>
                <p>They have a lot of room here at the hospital, there’d be enough to make studios
                    for thirty or so painters.</p>
                <p>I really must make up my mind, it’s only too true that an awful lot of painters
                    go mad, it’s a life which makes you very distracted, to say the least. If I
                    throw myself fully into work again, that’s good, but I still remain cracked. If
                    I could enlist for 5 years I would recover considerably and would be more
                    rational and more the master of myself.</p>
                <p>But one or the other, it’s all the same to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <work mention="vague">I hope that in the heap of canvases I’ve sent you there
                        may be some which will end up giving you pleasure. If I remain a painter,
                        then sooner or later I’ll probably see Paris again, and I firmly promise
                        myself that I’ll thoroughly touch up several old canvases on that
                        occasion.</work>
                    <stress reason="friendship">What’s Gauguin doing, I’m still avoiding writing to
                        him until I’m completely normal, but I think of him so often, and I’d so
                        much like to know if everything is going relatively well for him.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>If I hadn’t been in such a hurry, if I’d kept my studio, this summer I would have
                    worked again on all the canvases I’ve sent you. As long as the impasto isn’t dry
                    all the way through, naturally it can’t be scraped.</p>
                <p>You’ll clearly see that the two women’s expressions are different from the
                    expressions one sees in Paris.</p>
                <p>Is Signac back in Paris yet?</p>

            <body>
                <p>Thanks for your letter. You’re quite right to say that Mr Salles has been perfect
                    in all of this, I’m much obliged to him.</p>

                    <good_health>I wanted to tell you that I think I’ve done well to come here,
                        first, in seeing the reality of the life of the diverse mad or cracked
                        people in this menagerie, I’m losing the vague dread, the fear of the thing.
                        And little by little I can come to consider madness as being an illness like
                        any other. Then the change of surroundings is doing me good, I
                        imagine.</good_health>

                <p>
                    <unstress reason="career">The idea of my duty to work comes back to me a lot,
                        and I believe that all my faculties for work will come back to me quite
                        quickly. It’s just that work often absorbs me so much that I think I’ll
                        always be absentminded and awkward in getting by for the rest of life
                        too.</unstress>

                <p>I won’t write you a long letter — I’ll try to answer the letter from my new
                    sister, which greatly touched me, but I don’t know if I’ll manage to do it.</p>
            </body>
            <close>Handshake, and ever yours,</close>
            <sig>Vincent</sig>
            <ps>
                <p>My dear sister,</p>
                <p>Thanks very much for your letter, in which I above all looked for news of my
                    brother. And I find it very good. I can see that you have already observed that
                    he loves Paris and that this surprises you a little, you who don’t like it, or
                    rather who above all like the flowers there, such as, I suppose, for example,
                    the wisterias which are probably beginning to flower. Could it not be the case
                    that in liking a thing one sees it better and more accurately than in not liking
                    it.</p>
                <p>For him and for me Paris is certainly already a cemetery in a way, where many
                    artists have perished, whom we knew directly or indirectly.</p>
                <p>Certainly Millet, whom you’ll learn to like a lot, and with him many others, have
                    tried to get out of Paris. But Eugène Delacroix, for example, it’s difficult to
                    portray him ‘as a man’ other than as a Parisian.</p>
                <p>All this to urge you — with all caution, admittedly — to believe in the
                    possibility that there are homes in Paris, and not just apartments. </p>
                <p>Anyway — fortunately you are now his home yourself.</p>
                <p>
                    <bad_health>It’s quite odd perhaps that the result of this terrible attack is
                        that in my mind there’s hardly any really clear desire or hope left, and I’m
                        wondering if it is thus that one thinks when, with the passions somewhat
                        extinguished, one comes down the mountain instead of climbing
                        it.</bad_health> Anyway my sister, if you can believe, or almost, that
                    everything is always for the best in the best of worlds then you’ll also be able
                    to believe, perhaps, that Paris is the best of the towns in it.</p>
                <p>Have you noticed yet that the old cabhorses there have big, beautiful heartbroken
                    eyes, like Christians sometimes. Whatever the case, we’re not savages nor
                    peasants, and we perhaps even have a duty to love civilization (socalled).
                    Anyway, it would probably be hypocritical to say or believe that Paris is bad
                    when one lives there. The first time one sees Paris it may be, besides, that
                    everything there seems against nature, dirty and sad. Anyway, if you don’t like
                    Paris, above all do not like painting nor those who directly or indirectly are
                    engaged in it, for it’s only too doubtful whether that’s beautiful or
                    useful.</p>
                <p>But what can you do, there are people who love nature while being cracked or ill,
                    those are the painters, then there are some who love what is done by the hand of
                    man, and those even go as far as liking paintings. </p>
                <p>
                    <good_health>Although there are a few people here who are seriously ill, the
                        fear, the horror that I had of madness before has already been greatly
                        softened.</good_health>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="friendship">And although one continually hears shouts and
                        terrible howls as though of the animals in a menagerie, despite this the
                        people here know each other very well, and help each other when they suffer
                        crises. They all come to see when I’m working in the garden, and I can
                        assure you are more discreet and more polite to leave me in peace than, for
                        example, the good citizens of Arles.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <good_health>It’s possible that I’ll stay here for quite a long time, never have
                        I been so tranquil as here and at the hospital in Arles to be able to paint
                        a little at last.</good_health>
                    <unstress reason="environment">Very near here there are some little grey or blue
                        mountains, with very, very green wheatfields at their foot, and
                        pines.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="money">I shall count myself very happy if I manage to work
                        enough to earn my living, for it makes me very worried when I tell myself
                        that I’ve done so many paintings and drawings without ever selling
                        any.</stress> Don’t be in too much of a hurry to consider this an injustice,
                    I don’t know anything at all about it.</p>
                <p>Thanking you again for writing to me, and being very happy to know that now my
                    brother doesn’t return to an empty apartment when he comes home in the evening,
                    I shake your hand in thought, and believe me</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Your letter which I’ve just received gives me great pleasure. You tell me that
                    J.H. Weissenbruch has two paintings in the exhibition — but I thought he was
                    dead — am I mistaken? He certainly is one hell of an artist and a good man, with
                    a big heart too.</p>
                <p>What you say about the Berceuse gives me pleasure; it’s very true that the common
                    people, who buy themselves chromos and listen with sentimentality to barrel
                    organs, are vaguely in the right and perhaps more sincere than certain
                    menabouttown who go to the Salon.</p>
                <p>
                    <work mention="vague">Gauguin, if he’ll accept it, you shall give him a version
                        of the Berceuse that wasn’t mounted on a stretching frame, and to Bernard
                        too, as a token of friendship.</work>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <work mention="vague">But if Gauguin wants sunflowers it’s only absolutely fair
                        that he gives you something that you like as much in exchange. Gauguin
                        himself above all liked the sunflowers later, when he had seen them for a
                        long time.</work>
                </p>
                <p>You must know, too, that if you put them in this order:</p>
                <p>
                    <work mention="vague">that is, the Berceuse in the middle and the two canvases
                        of the sunflowers to the right and the left, this forms a sort of triptych.
                        And then the yellow and orange tones of the head take on more brilliance
                        through the proximity of the yellow shutters. And then you will understand
                        that what I was writing to you about it, that my idea had been to make a
                        decoration like one for the far end of a cabin on a ship, for example. Then
                        as the size gets bigger, the summary execution gets its raison d’être. The
                        middle frame is then the red one. And the two sunflowers that go with it are
                        those surrounded by strips of wood.</work>
                </p>
                <p>You see that this framing of simple laths does quite well, and a frame like that
                    costs only very little. It would be perhaps good to frame the green and red
                    vineyards, the sower and the furrows and the interior of the bedroom with them
                    too. </p>
                <p>
                    <work origin="new" stage="middle">Here’s a new no. 30 canvas, commonplace again,
                        like one of those chromos from a penny bazaar that depict eternal nests of
                        greenery for lovers.</work>
                </p>
                <p>Thick treetrunks covered with ivy, the ground also covered with ivy and
                    periwinkle, a stone bench and a bush of roses, blanched in the cold shadow. In
                    the foreground a few plants with white calyxes. It’s green, violet and pink.</p>
                <p>It’s just a question — which is unfortunately lacking in chromos from a penny
                    bazaar and barrel organs — of putting in some style.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="environment">Since I’ve been here, the neglected garden
                        planted with tall pines under which grows tall and badly tended grass
                        intermingled with various weeds, has provided me with enough work, and I
                        haven’t yet gone outside.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="environment">However, the landscape of StRémy is very
                        beautiful, and little by little I’m probably going to make trips into
                        it.</unstress>
                    <unstress reason="career">But staying here as I am, the doctor has naturally
                        been in a better position to see what was wrong, and will, I dare hope, be
                        more reassured that he can let me paint.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <good_health>I assure you that I’m very well here, and that for the time being I
                        see no reason at all to come and board in Paris or its
                        surroundings.</good_health>
                    <unstress reason="environment">I have a little room with greygreen paper with
                        two watergreen curtains with designs of very pale roses enlivened with thin
                        lines of bloodred. These curtains, probably the leftovers of a ruined,
                        deceased rich man, are very pretty in design. Probably from the same source
                        comes a very worn armchair covered with a tapestry flecked in the manner of
                        a Diaz or a Monticelli, redbrown, pink, creamy white, black, forgetmenot
                        blue and bottle green.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="environment">Through the ironbarred window I can make out a
                        square of wheat in an enclosure, a perspective in the manner of Van Goyen,
                        above which in the morning I see the sun rise in its glory.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="career">With this — as there are more than 30 empty rooms — I
                        have another room in which to work.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>The food is soso. It smells naturally a little musty, as in a cockroachridden
                    restaurant in Paris or a boarding school. As these unfortunates do absolutely
                    nothing (not a book, nothing to distract them but a game of boules and a game of
                    draughts) they have no other daily distraction than to stuff themselves with
                    chickpeas, haricot beans, lentils and other groceries and colonial foodstuffs by
                    the regulated quantities and at fixed times.</p>
                <p>As the digestion of these commodities presents certain difficulties, they thus
                    fill their days in a manner as inoffensive as it’s cheap. <good_health>But
                        joking apart, the fear of madness passes from me considerably</good_health>
                    <bad_health>upon seeing from close at hand those who are affected with it, as I
                        may very easily be in the future.</bad_health>
                </p>
                <p>Before I had some repulsion for these beings, and it was something distressing
                    for me to have to reflect that so many people of our profession, Troyon,
                    Marchal, Meryon, Jundt, M. Maris, Monticelli, a host of others, had ended up
                    like that. I wasn’t even able to picture them in the least in that state.</p>
                <p>
                    <good_health>Well, now I think of all this without fear, i.e. I find it no more
                        atrocious than if these people had snuffed it of something else, of
                        consumption or syphilis, for example.</good_health>
                </p>
                <p>These artists, I see them take on their serene bearing again, and do you think
                    it’s a small thing to rediscover ancient members of the profession.</p>
                <p>Joking apart, that’s what I’m profoundly grateful for.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="friendship">For although there are some who howl or usually
                        rave, here there is much true friendship that they have for each other. They
                        say, one must suffer others for the others to suffer us, and other very true
                        reasonings that they thus put into practice. And between ourselves we
                        understand each other very well, I can, for example, chat sometimes with one
                        who doesn’t reply except in incoherent sounds, because he isn’t afraid of
                        me. </unstress>
                </p>
                <p>If someone has some crisis the others look after him, and intervene so that he
                    doesn’t harm himself.</p>
                <p>The same for those who have the mania of often getting angry. Old regulars of the
                    menagerie run up and separate the fighters, if there is a fight.</p>
                <p>It’s true that there are some who are in a more serious condition, whether they
                    be filthy, or dangerous. These are in another courtyard. Now I take a bath twice
                    a week, and stay in it for 2 hours, then my stomach is infinitely better than a
                    year ago, so I only have to continue, as far as I know. <unstress reason="money"
                        >I think I’ll spend less here than elsewhere, since here I still have work
                        on my plate, for nature is beautiful.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <good_health>My hope would be that at the end of a year I’ll know better than
                        now what I can do and what I want. Then, little by little, an idea will come
                        to me for beginning again.</good_health> Coming back to Paris or anywhere at
                    the moment doesn’t appeal to me at all, I feel that I’m in the right place here.
                    In my opinion, what most of those who have been here for years are suffering
                    from is an extreme sluggishness. Now, my work will preserve me from that to a
                    certain extent.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="environment">The room where we stay on rainy days is like a
                        3rdclass waiting room in some stagnant village, all the more so since there
                        are honourable madmen who always wear a hat, spectacles and travelling
                        clothes and carry a cane, almost like at the seaside, and who represent the
                        passengers there.</unstress>

                        especially some canvas. When I send you the 4 canvases of the garden I have

                        garden, it isn’t so sad.</work>
                    <work origin="new" stage="finished">Yesterday I drew a very large, rather rare
                        night moth there which is called the death’s head, its coloration
                        astonishingly distinguished: black, grey, white, shaded, and with glints of
                        carmine or vaguely tending towards olive green; it’s very big.</work>
                </p>
                <p> To paint it I would have had to kill it, and that would have been a shame since
                    the animal was so beautiful. <work mention="vague">I’ll send you the drawing of
                        it with a few other drawings of plants.</work>
                </p>
                <p>You could take the canvases which are dry enough at Tanguy’s or at your place off
                    the stretching frames and then put the new ones you consider worthy of it onto
                    these stretching frames. Gauguin must be able to give you the address of a liner
                    for the Bedroom who won’t be expensive.<stress reason="money"> This I imagine
                        must be a 5franc restoration, if it’s more then don’t have it done, I don’t
                        think that Gauguin paid more when he quite often had canvases of his own,
                        Cézanne or Pissarro lined.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <good_health>Speaking of my condition, I’m still so grateful for yet another
                        thing. I observe in others that, like me, they too have heard sounds and
                        strange voices during their crises, that things also appeared to change
                        before their eyes. And that softens the horror that I retained at first of
                        the crisis I had, and which when it comes to you unexpectedly, cannot but
                        frighten you beyond measure. Once one knows that it’s part of the illness
                        one takes it like other things. Had I not seen other mad people at close
                        hand I wouldn’t have been able to rid myself of thinking about it all the
                        time. For the sufferings of anguish aren’t funny when you’re caught in a
                        crisis.</good_health> Most epileptics bite their tongues and injure them.
                    Rey told me that he had known a case where someone had injured his ear as I did,
                    and I believe I’ve heard a doctor here who came to see me with the director say
                    that he too had seen it before. <good_health>I dare to believe that once one
                        knows what it is, once one is aware of one’s state and of possibly being
                        subject to crises, that then one can do something about it oneself so as not
                        to be caught so much unawares by the anguish or the terror.</good_health>
                    Now, this has been diminishing for 5 months, I have good hope of getting over
                    it, or at least of not having crises of such force. There’s one person here who
                    has been shouting and always talking, like me, for a fortnight, he thinks he
                    hears voices and words in the echo of the corridors, probably because the
                    auditory nerve is sick and too sensitive, and with me it was both the sight and
                    the hearing at the same time which, according to what Rey said one day, is usual
                    at the beginning of epilepsy.</p>
                <p>Now the shock had been such that it disgusted me even to move, and nothing would
                    have been so agreeable to me as never to wake up again. <good_health>At present
                        this horror of life is already less pronounced, and the melancholy less
                        acute.</good_health>
                    <bad_health>But I still have absolutely no will, hardly any desires or none, and
                        everything that has to do with ordinary life, the desire for example to see
                        friends again, about whom I think however, almost nil. That’s why I’m not
                        yet at the point where I ought to leave here soon, I would still have
                        melancholy for everything. And it’s even only in these very last days that
                        the repulsion for life has changed quite radically. There’s still a way to
                        go from there to will and action.</bad_health>
                </p>
                <p>It’s a shame that you yourself are still condemned to Paris, and that you never
                    see the countryside other than that around Paris.</p>
                <p>I think that it’s no more unfortunate for me to be in the company where I am than
                    for you always the fateful things at Goupil &amp; Cie. From that point of view
                    we’re quite equal. For only in part can you act in accordance with your ideas.
                    Since, however, we have once got used to these inconveniences, it becomes second
                    nature.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="money">I think that although the paintings cost canvas, paint
                        &amp;c., at the end of the month, however, it’s more advantageous to spend a
                        little more thus, and to make them with what I’ve learned in total, than to
                        abandon them while one would have to pay for board and lodging all the same
                        anyway.</stress>
                    <work mention="vague">And that’s why I’m making them. So this month I have 4 no.
                        30 canvases and two or three drawings.</work>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="money">But no matter what one does, the question of money is
                        always there like the enemy before the troops, and one can’t deny it or
                        forget it.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>I retain my duties in that respect as much as anyone. And perhaps some day I’ll
                    be in a position to repay all that I’ve spent, because I consider that what I’ve
                    spent is, if not taken from you at least taken from the family, so consequently
                    I’ve produced paintings and I’ll do more. That is to act as you too act
                    yourself. If I had private means, perhaps my mind would be freer to do art for
                    art’s sake, now I content myself with believing that in working assiduously even
                    so, without thinking of it one perhaps makes some progress.</p>
                <p>Here are the colours I would need</p>
                <p> 3 emerald green</p>
                <p> 2 cobalt</p>
                <p> 1 ultramarine</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="money">I still have to ask you to send me a few ordinary brushes
                        as soon as possible, of more or less these sizes</stress>
                </p>
                <p>Half a dozen of each please.</p>
                <p>I hope that you’re well and your wife too, and that you’ll enjoy a little of the
                    good weather. At least here we have splendid sunshine.</p>
                <p>
                    <good_health>As for me, my health is good, and as for the head it will, let’s
                        hope, be a matter of time and patience.</good_health>
                </p>
                <p>The director had a few words with me to say that he’d received a letter from you,
                    and that he’d written to you. To me he says nothing and I ask nothing of him,
                    which is simplest. He’s a little gouty man — widowed a few years ago — who has
                    very dark spectacles. As the establishment is a little moribund, the man appears
                    to take only a rather halfhearted enjoyment in this profession, and besides
                    there’s reason enough for it.</p>
                <p>A new person has arrived who is so agitated that he breaks everything and shouts
                    day and night, he also tears the straitjackets and up to now he scarcely calms
                    down, although he’s in a bath all day long, he demolishes his bed and all the
                    rest in his room, overturns his food &amp;c. It’s very sad to see — but they
                    have a lot of patience here and will eventually get there, however. </p>
                <p>
                    <bad_health>New things become old so quickly — I think that if I came to Paris
                        in the state of mind I’m currently in, I wouldn’t make any distinction
                        between a socalled dark painting or a bright Impressionist painting, between
                        a varnished painting in oils and a matt picture done with thinned
                        paint.</bad_health>
                </p>
                <p>I mean by this that having reflected as time passed — I believe more than ever in
                    the eternal youth of the school of Delacroix, Millet, Rousseau, Dupré, Daubigny,
                    just as much as in the current one or even in artists to come. I scarcely
                    believe that Impressionism will ever do more than the Romantics, for
                    example.</p>
                <p>It’s certainly a far cry between that and admiring people like Léon Glaize or
                    Perrault.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="environment">This morning I saw the countryside from my window
                        a long time before sunrise with nothing but the morning star, which looked
                        very big.</unstress> Daubigny and Rousseau did that, though, with the
                    expression of all the intimacy and all the great peace and majesty that it has,
                    adding to it a feeling so heartbreaking, so personal. These emotions I do not
                    detest.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="career">I still have remorse, and enormously when I think of my
                        work, so little in harmony with what I’d have wished to do. I hope that in
                        the long run it will make me do better things, but we aren’t there
                        yet.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>I think that you would do well to wash the canvases that are quite quite dry with
                    water and a little spirits of wine to remove the oil and the thinner from the
                    impasto. The same for the night café and the green vineyard, and above all for
                    the landscape that was in the walnut frame. The night also (but that one has
                    recent retouchings which might run with the spirits of wine).</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="environment">I’ve been here almost a whole month, not one
                        single time have I had the slightest desire to be elsewhere; just the will
                        to work again is becoming a tiny bit firmer.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>I don’t notice any very clear desire to be elsewhere in the others either, and
                    this may very well come from the fact that one feels too decidedly broken for
                    life outside.</p>
                <p>What I don’t really understand is their absolute idleness. But that’s the great
                    defect of the south, and its ruin. <unstress reason="environment">But what a
                        beautiful land and what beautiful blue and what a sun.</unstress>
                    <stress reason="environment">And yet I’ve only seen the garden and what I can
                        make out through the window.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>Have you read the new book by Guy de Maupassant, Fort comme la mort, what is its
                    subject? What I read last in this category was Zola’s Le rêve, I found the
                    figure of the woman, the embroiderer, very, very beautiful, and the description
                    of the embroidery all in gold. Precisely because it’s like a question of colour,
                    different yellows, whole and broken. But the figure of the man struck me as
                    rather lifeless, and the great cathedral also made me as melancholy as hell.
                    Only that lilac and dark blue repoussoir makes, if you will, the blonde figure
                    stand out. But anyway, there are already things by Lamartine like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="career">I hope that you’ll destroy a heap of things that are too
                        bad in the heap I sent, or at least will only show the most passable
                        ones.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>As regards the exhibition of the Independents, it’s all the same to me, act as if
                    I wasn’t there at all. <work origin="existing" stage="finished">To not be
                        indifferent and not exhibit something too mad, perhaps the starry night and
                        the landscape with yellow greenery which was in the walnut frame.</work>
                    Since these are two of contrary colours, </p>
                <p> and that might give others the idea of doing night effects better than I do.</p>
                <p>Anyway you must absolutely stop worrying with regard to me now. <work
                        origin="new" stage="planned">When I receive the new canvas and the colours
                        I’ll go out a bit to see the countryside.</work>
                </p>
                <p>Since it’s just the season when there are lots of flowers and thus colour
                    effects, it will perhaps be wise to send me another 5 metres of canvas in
                    addition.</p>
                <p>For the flowers will be shortlived and will be replaced by the yellow
                    wheatfields. The latter, above all, I would like to capture better than in
                    Arles. The mistral (since there are a few mountains here) appears far less
                    annoying than in Arles, where you always get it at first hand.</p>
                <p>When you receive the canvases I’ve done in the garden you’ll see that I’m not too
                    melancholy here.</p>
                <p>More soon, good handshake in thought to you and to Jo.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Enclosed I’m sending you a letter from Mother, naturally you know all the news it
                    contains. I think it’s very logical of Cor to go there. What is different there
                    from staying in Europe is that down there one doesn’t have to undergo the
                    influence of our large cities, as one does here, so old that everything in them
                    seems to be in its dotage and tottering. So instead of seeing one’s vital forces
                    and natural, native energy evaporate in circumlocution, it’s possible that one
                    might be happier far from our society. Even if it were otherwise, the fact
                    remains that it’s to act uprightly and in accordance with his upbringing for him
                    not to hesitate to accept this position. So now it isn’t to tell you all this
                    news that you know that I’m sending you the letter. But it’s for you to observe
                    in it a little how remarkably firm and regular the writing is when one thinks
                    that it’s true what she says, that she’s ‘a mother approaching 70’. <unstress
                        reason="family">And as you’ve already written to me, and our sister has too,
                        that she seems to have got younger, I see it myself from this very clear
                        writing and in her tighter logic in what she writes, and the simplicity with
                        which she appreciates facts. I believe now that this rejuvenation has
                        obviously come to her from the fact that she’s happy that you’ve got
                        married, which she’d wanted for so long; and I congratulate you that your
                        marriage can give you and Jo the rather rare pleasure of seeing your mother
                        growing young again.</unstress>
                    <stress reason="family">It’s really for that that I’m sending you this letter.
                        Because, my dear brother, it’s sometimes necessary later to remember – and
                        it’s so timely that, at the very moment when she’ll have the great pain of
                        being separated from Cor – and it will be hard on her, that – she should be
                        consoled by knowing that you’re married. If the thing were possible you
                        shouldn’t wait fully a whole year before returning to Holland, for she’ll be
                        longing to see you again, you and your wife.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>At the same time, having married a Dutchwoman, that could in a few years, sooner
                    or later, warm up business relations with Amsterdam or The Hague again.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="family">Anyway, once again I haven’t seen a letter from Mother
                        indicating so much inner serenity and calm contentment as this one – not for
                        many years. And I’m sure that this comes from your marriage. It’s said that
                        pleasing one’s parents brings a long life.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>I now thank you very much for the consignment of colours, deduct them from the
                    order placed since, but if it’s at all possible, not for the quantity of white.
                    I thank you also very cordially for the Shakespeare. It will help me not to
                    forget the little English I know – but above all it’s so beautiful.</p>
                <p>I’ve begun to read the series I know the least well, which before, being
                    distracted by something else or not having the time it was impossible for me to
                    read, the series of the kings. I’ve already read Richard II, Henry IV and half
                    of Henry V. I read without reflecting on whether the ideas of the people of that
                    time are the same as ours, or what becomes of them when one places them face to
                    face with republican or socialist beliefs &amp;c. But what touches me in it, as
                    in the work of certain novelists of our time, is that the voices of these
                    people, which in Shakespeare’s case reach us from a distance of several
                    centuries, don’t appear unknown to us. It’s so alive that one thinks one knows
                    them and sees it.</p>
                <p>So what Rembrandt alone, or almost alone, has among painters, that tenderness in
                    the gazes of human beings we see either in the Pilgrims at Emmaus, or in the
                    Jewish bride, or in some strange figure of an angel as in the painting you had
                    the good fortune to see – that heartbroken tenderness, that glimpse of a
                    superhuman infinite which appears so natural then, one encounters it in many
                    places in Shakespeare. And then serious or gay portraits like the Six, like the
                    traveller, like the Saskia, it’s above all full of that. What a good idea Victor
                    Hugo’s son had of translating all of it into French so that it’s thus within the
                    reach of all. When I think of the Impressionists and of all these presentday
                    questions of art, how many lessons there are precisely for us in there.</p>
                <p>So from what I’ve just read the idea comes to me that the Impressionists are
                    right a thousand times over. Yet even they must think about it for a long time
                    and always. If it follows from that that they have the right or the duty to do
                    themselves justice, </p>
                <p> and if they dare call themselves primitives, certainly they’d do well to learn
                    to be primitive as people a little, too, before pronouncing the word primitive
                    like a title that would give them rights to whatsoever. But those who would be
                    the cause of the Impressionists being unhappy, well naturally the case for them
                    is serious, also when they make light of it.</p>
                <p>And then it would appear that waging a battle seven times a week couldn’t go
                    on.</p>
                <p>It’s amazing, though, how L’abbesse de Jouarre, when you think of it, holds its
                    own even beside Shakespeare.</p>
                <p> I think that Renan treated himself to that in order to be able to say beautiful
                    words for once in full and at his ease, because these are beautiful words.</p>
                <p>
                    <work mention="vague">So that you may have an idea of what I have on the go I’m
                        sending you ten or so drawings today, all after canvases on the go.</work>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <work origin="existing" stage="middle">The latest one begun is the wheatfield
                        where there’s a little reaper and a big sun. The canvas is all yellow with
                        the exception of the wall and the bottom of purplish hills.</work>
                    <work origin="existing" stage="middle">The canvas with almost the same subject
                        differs in coloration, being a greyish green and a white and blue
                        sky.</work>

                <p>
                    <stress reason="friendship">How I think of Reid as I read Shakespeare, and how
                        I’ve thought of him several times when I was iller than at present. Finding
                        that I’d been infinitely too harsh and perhaps discouraging towards him in
                        claiming that it was better to love painters than paintings.</stress> It
                    isn’t up to me to make distinctions like that, not even when faced with the
                    problem that we see our living friends suffering so much from the lack of enough
                    money to feed themselves and pay for their colours, and on the other hand the
                    high prices that are paid for the canvases of dead painters. In a newspaper I
                    was reading a letter from a collector of Greek objects to one of his friends,
                    which contained this phrase ‘you who love nature, I who love all that the hand
                    of man has made, this difference in our tastes deep down creates the unity in
                    it’. And I found that better than my reasoning.</p>
                <p>
                    <work mention="vague">I have a canvas of cypresses with a few ears of wheat,
                        poppies, a blue sky, which is like a multicoloured Scottish plaid.</work>
                    This one, which is impasted like the Monticellis, <work mention="vague">and the
                        wheatfield with the sun that represents extreme heat, also thickly
                        impasted,</work>
                    <stress reason="friendship">I think that this would explain to him more or less,
                        however, that he couldn’t lose much by being our friend. But that’s true on
                        our side too, and precisely because we were perhaps right to disapprove of
                        his method we ought on our side to take a step towards
                        reconciliation.</stress> Anyway, I daren’t yet write now for fear of saying
                    too many foolish things, but when I’m more certain of my pen I’d very much like
                    to write to him one day. It’s the same for other friends, but I really have told
                    myself that I should wait as long as possible before being able, even in the
                    best of circumstances, to arrive at this ‘being a little more certain of
                    myself’.</p>
                <p>
                    <work mention="vague">I still have canvases in Arles that weren’t dry when I
                        left, I very much want to go and get them one of these days in order to send
                        them to you. There are half a dozen of them. The drawings appear to me to
                        have little colour this time, and this is very probably due to the
                        oversmooth paper.</work>

                        <work origin="existing" stage="finished">the Courtyard of the hospital at
                        Arles</work> are more coloured, but that though will give you an idea of
                    what I have on the go. The canvas of the reaper will become something like the
                    Sower of the other year.</p>
                <p>As later the books of Zola will remain beautiful precisely because they have
                    life.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="family">What also has life is the fact that Mother is happy that
                        you’re married, and I think that this cannot be disagreeable to yourselves,
                        you and Jo. But the separation from Cor will be so hard for her that it’s
                        difficult to imagine.</stress> It is precisely in learning to suffer without
                    complaining, learning to consider pain without repugnance, that one risks
                    vertigo a little; and yet it might be possible, yet one glimpses even a vague
                    probability that on the other side of life we’ll glimpse justifications for
                    pain, which seen from here sometimes takes up the whole horizon so much that it
                    takes on the despairing proportions of a deluge. Of that we know very little, of
                    proportions, and it’s better to look at a wheatfield, even in the state of a
                    painting. I shake your hands firmly and will have news of you soon I hope. Good
                    health to you both.</p>

            <salutation>Dear brother and sister.</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="family">Jo’s letter tells me a very great piece of news this
                        morning, I congratulate you on it, and am very pleased to hear it.
                    </unstress>I was very touched by your reasoning when you say that as neither of
                    you are in as good health as appears desirable on an occasion like this, you had
                    a kind of doubt, and in any case a feeling of pity for the child to come
                    traversed your soul. This child in this case, has it, even before its birth,
                    been less well loved than the child of very healthy parents, whose first impulse
                    would have been a keen joy? Surely not. We know so little about life that we’re
                    not really in a position to judge between good and bad, just or unjust, and to
                    say that one is unhappy because one suffers hasn’t been proved. You should know
                    that Roulin’s child came to them smiling and very healthy, while the parents
                    were at bay. So take it as it is, wait with confidence and possess your soul
                    with a long patience as an old saying has it, and with good will. Let nature
                    take its course.</p>
                <p>As to what you say about Theo’s health, my dear sister, while sharing your
                    anxieties with all my heart I must nevertheless reassure you, precisely because
                    I’ve seen that his health is changeable and uneven rather than weak, as is mine,
                    for that matter.</p>
                <p>I very much like to believe that illnesses sometimes cure us, i.e. that when the
                    illness comes to a crisis it’s a thing necessary to the recovery of a normal
                    state of body. No, subsequent to the marriage he’ll regain his strength, still
                    having the reserve of youth and power to restore him.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="family">I’m very pleased that he’s no longer alone, and truly
                        I don’t doubt that he’ll regain his former temperament after a while. And
                        then above all when he’s a father and the feeling of fatherhood comes to
                        him, that will be a considerable gain.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>In my life as a painter, and above all when I’m in the country, it’s not so
                    difficult for me to be alone, because in the country one feels the bonds that
                    unite us all more easily. But in town, as he has done his ten consecutive years
                    with the Goupils in Paris, it isn’t possible to live alone. So with patience it
                    will return.</p>
                <p>
                    <work mention="vague">I’m going to Arles tomorrow to fetch the canvases that are
                        still over there, which I’ll send you shortly. And I’m going to send you
                        some as soon as possible to try to give you peasant thoughts, even though
                        you’re in town.</work>
                </p>
                <p>This morning I talked a little with the doctor here – he told me – which was
                    absolutely what I had already thought – that one must wait a year before
                    believing oneself to be cured, since the smallest thing could bring on another
                    attack.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="money">Then he offered to take my furniture here so that we
                        don’t have double expenses.</unstress> Tomorrow I’ll go and talk about that
                    in Arles with Mr Salles.</p>
                <p> When I came here I left 50 francs with Mr Salles to settle up with the hospital
                    in Arles, he’ll certainly have some over. But having again quite often needed
                    various things, the surplus that Mr Peyron had here is exhausted. <stress
                        reason="money">I’m a little surprised myself that in living with the
                        greatest possible sobriety and regularity for the last 6 months, without
                        having my independent studio, I’m not spending less or producing more than
                        the previous, relatively less sober year.</stress>
                    <bad_health>And inwardly I feel neither more nor less remorse &amp;c. if you
                        like. Suffice to say that everything one calls good and bad is however quite
                        relative, it seems to me. I live soberly here because I have the opportunity
                        to. I drank before because I no longer knew how to do otherwise. Anyway it’s
                        all the same to me!!! Sobriety, very calculated it’s true, nevertheless
                        leads to a state of being in which thought, if you have any, flows more
                        easily. Anyway it’s a difference like painting grey or coloured. I’m in fact
                        going to paint more greyly.</bad_health>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="money">Only instead of paying money to a landlord we’re giving
                        it to the asylum, I don’t see the difference – and it’s scarcely cheaper.
                        The work is a thing apart, and has always cost me a lot.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>I thank you very much for the consignment of colours and canvas, which I’m very
                    pleased with. <work origin="new" stage="planned">I hope to go and redo the olive
                        trees.</work> There are unfortunately very few vineyards here.</p>
                <p>My health is good, though, and I have a feeling quite similar to the one I had
                    when I was much younger, when I was also very sober, too much so, I believe they
                    used to say. But it’s all the same, I’ll try to get by.</p>
                <p>As regards being godfather to a son of yours, while first of all it could be a
                    girl, truly, in the circumstances I would prefer to wait until I’m no longer
                    here. Then Mother would certainly set her heart a little on him being called
                    after our father, I for one would find that more logical in the
                    circumstances.</p>
                <p>
                    <good_health>I enjoyed myself very much yesterday reading Measure for
                        measure.</good_health> Then I read Henry VIII, in which there are such
                    beautiful passages, like the one about Buckingham, and Wolsey’s words after his
                    downfall.</p>
                <p>I think I’m lucky to be able to read or reread this at my leisure, and then I
                    very much hope to read Homer at last. <unstress reason="environment">Outside the
                        cicadas are singing fit to burst, a strident cry ten times louder than that
                        of the crickets, and the scorched grass is taking on beautiful tones of old
                        gold. And the beautiful towns of the south are in the state of our dead
                        towns along the Zuiderzee, which were formerly lively. While in the downfall
                        and the decline of things, the cicadas dear to good old Socrates have
                        remained. And here, certainly, they’re still singing old Greek.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>If our friend Isaäcson heard them, his face would light up.</p>
                <p>What Jo writes about you always eating at home, that’s perfect. Anyway, I think
                    that’s going very well, and once again, while sharing with all my heart all
                    possible worries about Theo’s health, within me the hope predominates that in
                    this case a more or less sickly condition is only the result of the efforts of
                    nature to right itself. Patience. Mauve always claimed that nature was good, and
                    even a lot more than one usually thought. Is there anything in his past that
                    proves that he was wrong. His fits of melancholy in his last days, do you think?
                    I myself would be inclined to believe otherwise.</p>
                <p>More soon, but I wanted to write to you straightaway that this morning’s news
                    gives me great pleasure. Handshakes and</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Tomorrow I’ll send you a roll of canvases by goods train. There are four of them,
                    i.e. the following</p>
                <p>
                    <work origin="existing" stage="finished"> 1 View of Arles, orchards in
                        blossom</work>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <work origin="existing" stage="finished">2 The ivy</work>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <work origin="existing" stage="finished">3 The lilacs</work>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <work origin="existing" stage="finished">4 Pink chestnut trees in the botanical
                        gardens in Arles</work>
                </p>
                <p>which will hold their own with the ones you already have, such as the red and
                    green Vineyard, The garden, The harvest, The starry sky.</p>
                <p>I’m also enclosing another 7 studies which are dry but which are studies after
                    nature rather than subjects for paintings.</p>
                <p>And that’s how it always is, you have to do several of them before you find a
                    whole with character. Now here are the subjects of these 7 studies.</p>
                <p>
                    <work origin="new" stage="finished">The irises</work> – <work origin="new"
                        stage="finished">View of the asylum at StRémy, no. 30 canvases.</work>
                    <work origin="new" stage="finished">Peach trees in blossom (Arles),</work>
                    <work origin="new" stage="finished">Meadows (Arles),</work>
                    <work origin="new" stage="finished"> Olive trees (StRémy),</work>
                    <work origin="new" stage="finished">Old willows (Arles),</work>
                    <work origin="new" stage="finished">Orchard in blossom.</work>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <work mention="vague">Now the next consignment, which will follow shortly, will
                        consist mainly of wheatfields and olive groves.</work>
                </p>
                <p>As you can see, I’ve been to Arles to fetch these canvases. The orderly from here
                    accompanied me. We went to Mr Salles’s house, who had gone away on holiday for
                    two months, then to the hospital to see Mr Rey, whom I didn’t find either. So we
                    spent the day with my former neighbours, as well as my charwoman from those days
                    and a few others.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="friendship">One becomes very attached to people one has seen
                        while ill, and it did me a world of good to see some people again who were
                        kind and indulgent towards me then.</unstress> Someone told me that Mr Rey
                    had taken an examination and had been to Paris, but the porter at the hospital
                    said he didn’t know. I’m curious to know if you might have seen him, for he had
                    planned to go and see the exhibition and then pay you a visit. The doctor from
                    here will perhaps not go to Paris, he suffers a great deal from his gout.</p>
                <p>I’ve also received the second consignment of canvases and colours, and I thank
                    you very much for them. <work origin="new" stage="finished">The latest canvas
                        I’ve done is a view of mountains with a darkish hut among olive trees at the
                        bottom.</work>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="family">I imagine that you’ll be very absorbed by thoughts of
                        the child to come, I’m very pleased that this should be so, with time I dare
                        believe that you’ll thus find much inner serenity.</unstress> The fact that
                    one takes on a kind of second nature in Paris, that moreover preoccupations with
                    business and art make one less strong than the peasants, doesn’t prevent one,
                    through the bonds of having wife and child, from reattaching oneself all the
                    same to that </p>
                <p> simpler and truer nature whose ideal sometimes haunts us.</p>
                <p>What a business, that Secrétan sale.</p>
                <p>It always pleases me that the Millets are holding their own. But how I would like
                    to see more good reproductions of Millet. So that it can reach the common folk.
                    The body of work is above all sublime considered as a whole, and it will become
                    more and more difficult to form an idea of it when the paintings are
                    dispersed.</p>
                <p>
                    <work mention="vague">I’m sorry not to be able to add the Wheatfield with the
                        reaper to this consignment.</work>
                </p>
                <p>Write me a line soon.</p>
                <p>Handshake to you and Jo.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="friendship">If I’m writing to you again today it’s because I’m
                        enclosing a few words that I’ve written to our friend Gauguin, feeling
                        sufficient calm return to me these last few days for my letter not to be
                        absolutely absurd, it seemed to me. Besides, there’s no proof that by
                        overrefining one’s scruples of respect or feeling one thereby gains
                        respectfulness or good sense.</stress>
                    <good_health>That being so, it does me good to talk with the pals again, even if
                        at a distance.</good_health> And you – my dear fellow – how are things, and
                    so write me a few words one of these days – for I can imagine that the emotions
                    which must move the forthcoming father of a family, emotions of which our good
                    father so loved to speak, must be great and of sterling worth in you, as in him,
                    but for the moment are almost impossible for you to express in the rather
                    incoherent mixture of the petty vexations of Paris. Realities of this sort must
                    anyway be like a good gust of the mistral, not very soothing, but healthgiving.
                        <good_health>As for me, it gives me very great pleasure I can assure you,
                        and will contribute greatly to bringing me out of my moral fatigue and
                        perhaps from my listlessness</good_health>. </p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="family">Anyway, there’s enough to bring back the taste for
                        life a little when I think that I myself am going to be promoted uncle of
                        this boy planned by your wife. I find it quite funny that she’s so convinced
                        that it’s a boy, but anyway, we’ll see.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>Anyway, in the meantime I can do nothing but fiddle with my paintings a little.
                        <work origin="new" stage="middle">I have one on the go of a moonrise over
                        the same field as the croquis in the Gauguin letter, but in which stacks
                        replace the wheat. It’s dull ochreyellow and violet.</work> Anyway, you’ll
                    see in a while from now.</p>
                <p>
                    <work origin="new" stage="middle">I also have a new one with ivy on the
                        go.</work> Above all, dear fellow, I beg of you, don’t fret or worry or be
                    melancholy on my account, the idea that you would do so, certainly in this
                    necessary and salutary quarantine, would have little justification when we need
                    a slow and patient recovery. If we manage to grasp that, we spare our forces for
                    this winter. <stress reason="environment">I imagine that winter must be quite
                        dismal here, anyway will however have to try and occupy myself.</stress>
                    <work origin="existing" stage="middle">I often imagine that I could retouch a
                        lot of last year’s studies from Arles this winter.</work>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <work origin="existing" stage="middle">Thus, having kept back these past few
                        days a large study of an orchard which was very difficult (it’s the same
                        orchard of which you’ll find a variation in the consignment, but quite a
                        vague one), I’ve set to reworking it from memory, and have found a way
                        better to express the harmony of the tones.</work>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <work mention="vague">Tell me, have you received any drawings from me? I sent
                        you some once, by parcel post, half a dozen, and then later ten or
                        so.</work> If by chance you haven’t received them, they must have been at
                    the railway station for days and weeks.</p>
                <p>The doctor was telling me about Monticelli, that he had always considered him
                    eccentric, but as for mad, he had only been a little that way towards the end.
                    Considering all the miseries of M’s last years, is it any surprise that he bowed
                    beneath a weight that was too heavy, and is one right in trying to deduce from
                    that that he failed in his work, artistically speaking? I dare to believe not.
                    There was some very logical calculation about him, and an originality as a
                    painter, so it remains regrettable that one wasn’t able to sustain it so as to
                    make its blossoming more complete.</p>
                <p>
                    <work origin="new" stage="finished">I enclose a croquis of the cicadas from
                        here.</work>
                </p>
                <p>Their song in times of great heat holds the same charm for me as the cricket in
                    the peasant’s hearth at home. My dear fellow – let’s not forget that small
                    emotions are the great captains of our lives, and that these we obey without
                    knowing it. If it’s still hard for me to regain courage over faults committed
                    and to be committed, which would be my recovery, let’s not forget from that
                    moment on that neither our spleens and melancholies nor our feelings of good
                    nature and good sense are our sole guides, and above all not our final
                    custodians, and that if you yourself also find yourself facing hard
                    responsibilities to venture, if not to take, my word let’s not be too concerned
                    with each other, while it so happens that life’s circumstances in situations so
                    far removed from our youthful conceptions of the life of the artist would render
                    us brothers after all, as being companions in fate in many respects. Things are
                    so closely connected that here one sometimes finds cockroaches in the food as if
                    one were really in Paris, on the other hand it can happen in Paris that you
                    sometimes have a real thought of the fields. It’s certainly not much, but it’s
                    reassuring anyway. So take your fatherhood as a good fellow from our old heaths
                    would take it, those heaths that remain ineffably dear to us through all the
                    noise, tumult, fog, anguish of the towns, however timid our tenderness may be.
                    That’s to say, take your fatherhood there, from your nature as an exile and a
                    foreigner and a poor man, henceforth basing himself with the poor man’s instinct
                    on the probability of the real existence of a native country, of a real
                    existence at least of the memory, even while we’ve forgotten every day. Thus
                    sooner or later we find our fate. But certainly for you, as well as for me, it
                    would be a little hypocritical to forget completely our good humour, the
                    confident sloppiness we had as the poor devils we were as we came and went in
                    that Paris, so strange now – and to place too much weight upon our cares.</p>
                <p>
                    <good_health>Truly, I’m so pleased with the fact that if sometimes there are
                        cockroaches in the food here, in your home there is wife and
                        child.</good_health>
                </p>
                <p>Besides, it’s reassuring that Voltaire, for example, left us free to believe not
                    absolutely all of what we imagine. <stress reason="family">Thus while sharing
                        your wife’s concerns about your health I’m not going so far as to believe
                        what momentarily I was imagining, that worries about me were the cause of
                        your relatively rather long silence in respect of me, although this is so
                        well explained when one thinks of how preoccupying a pregnancy must
                        necessarily be.</stress> But it’s very good and it’s the path where everyone
                    walks in life. More soon, and good handshake to you and to Jo.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>
                    <bad_health>I thank Jo very much for writing to me, and knowing that you wish me
                        to write you a line I’m letting you know that it’s very difficult for me to
                        write, so disturbed is my mind.</bad_health> So I’m taking advantage of an
                    interval.</p>
                <p>Dr Peyron is really kind to me and really patient. <bad_health>You can imagine
                        that I’m very deeply distressed that the attacks have recurred when I was
                        already beginning to hope that it wouldn’t recur.</bad_health>
                </p>
                <p>You’ll perhaps do well to write a line to Dr Peyron to say that working on my
                    paintings is quite necessary to me for my recovery.</p>
                <p>
                    <bad_health>For these days, without anything to do and without being able to go
                        into the room he had allocated me for doing my painting, are almost
                        intolerable to me.</bad_health>
                </p>
                <p>I’ve received catalogue of the Gauguin, Bernard, Schuffenecker &amp;c.
                    exhibition, which I find interesting. <unstress reason="friendship">G. also
                        wrote me a kind letter, still a little vague and obscure, but anyway I must
                        say that I think they’re quite right to have exhibited among
                        themselves.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <bad_health>For many days I’ve been absolutely distraught, as in Arles, just as
                        much if not worse, and it’s to be presumed that these crises will recur in
                        the future, it is ABOMINABLE. I haven’t been able to eat for 4 days, as my
                        throat is swollen.</bad_health> It’s not in order to complain too much, I
                    hope, if I tell you these details, but to prove to you that I’m not yet in a fit
                    state to go to Paris or to PontAven unless it were to Charenton.</p>
                <p>
                    <bad_health>It appears that I pick up filthy things and eat them, although my
                        memories of these bad moments are vague, and it appears to me that there’s
                        something shady about it, still for the same reason that they have I don’t
                        know what prejudice against painters here.</bad_health>
                </p>
                <p>I no longer see any possibility for courage or good hope, but anyway it wasn’t
                    yesterday that we found out that this profession isn’t a happy one.</p>
                <p>
                    <good_health>All the same it gives me pleasure that you’ve received that
                        consignment from here, the landscapes.</good_health> Thank you above all for
                    that etching after Rembrandt. It’s surprising, and yet it makes me think again
                    of the man with the staff in the La Caze gallery. If you want to do me a very,
                    very great pleasure, then </p>
                <p> send a copy of it to Gauguin. Then the Rodin and Claude Monet brochure is really
                    interesting.</p>

            <salutation>My dear brother,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Although I’ve already written to you, there are still many things you have told
                    me and to which I haven’t yet replied. <stress reason="money">First that you’ve
                        rented a room in Tanguy’s house and that my canvases are there, that’s most
                        interesting – provided you’re not paying a lot for it – the expenses still
                        continuing and the canvases still taking their time to bring anything back
                        in, that often frightens me.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="family">Be that as it may, I think it’s a very good step, and
                        I thank you for it, as for so many other things.</unstress>
                    <stress reason="career">It’s curious that Maus has the idea of inviting young
                        Bernard and me for the next Vingtistes exhibition, I would really like to
                        exhibit there, while feeling my inferiority alongside so many Belgians who
                        have an enormous amount of talent.</stress> That Mellery, for instance, is a
                    great artist. And he’s also been holding up for a number of years now. <work
                        mention="vague">But I would do my best to try to do something good this
                        autumn. I’m working nonstop in my room,</work>
                    <good_health>which is doing me good and driving away, I imagine, these abnormal
                        ideas.</good_health>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <work origin="existing" stage="finished">Thus I’ve redone the canvas of the
                        Bedroom.</work> That study is certainly one of the best – sooner or later it
                    will definitely have to be lined. It was painted so quickly and dried in such a
                    way that, as the thinner evaporated immediately, the painting doesn’t adhere at
                    all firmly to the canvas. This will also be the case with other studies of mine
                    that were painted very quickly and with a thick impasto. Besides, this thin
                    canvas perishes after a while and can’t take a lot of impasto.</p>
                <p>You’ve taken some excellent stretching frames, damn it, if I had some like that
                    here to work on that would be better than these strips of wood from here that
                    warp in the sun.</p>
                <p>People say – and I’m quite willing to believe it – that it’s difficult to know
                    oneself – but it’s not easy to paint oneself either. Thus I’m working on two
                    portraits of myself at the moment – for want of another model – </p>
                <p> because it’s more than time that I did a bit of figure work. <work
                        origin="existing" stage="middle">One I began the first day I got up, I was
                        thin, pale as a devil. It’s dark violet blue and the head whiteish with
                        yellow hair, thus a colour effect.</work>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <work origin="new" stage="middle">But since then I’ve started another one,
                        threequarter length on a light background.</work>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <work origin="existing" stage="middle">Then I’m retouching some studies from
                        this summer – anyway I’m working from morning till night.</work>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="family">Are you well – darn it, I really wish for you that you
                        were 2 years further on, and that these early days of marriage, however
                        beautiful they may be at times, were behind you. I believe so firmly that a
                        marriage becomes good above all in the long run, and that then one recovers
                        one’s temperament. So take things with a certain northern phlegm and take
                        care of yourselves, both of you.</stress>
                    <bad_health>This bloody life in the fine arts is exhausting, so it
                        seems.</bad_health>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <good_health>Strength is coming back to me day by day, and once again it seems
                        to me that I already have almost too much of it. For to remain hardworking
                        at the easel it isn’t necessary to be a Hercules.</good_health>
                </p>
                <p>What you told me about Maus having been to see my canvases has made me think a
                    lot about Belgian painters lately and during my illness. Then memories come to
                    me like an avalanche, and I try to rebuild for myself that whole school of
                    modern Flemish artists to the point of being as homesick as a Swiss.</p>
                <p>Which isn’t good, for our path is – onward – and retracing one’s steps is
                    forbidden and impossible. That’s to say that one could think about it without
                    getting lost in the past through an overmelancholy nostalgia.</p>
                <p>Anyway, Henri Conscience isn’t a perfect writer at all, but here and there, more
                    or less everywhere, what a painter! And what kindness in what he said and wished
                    for. All the time I have a preface in my head – (the one to Le conscrit) to one
                    of his books in which he says that he’d been very ill and that in his illness,
                    despite all his efforts, he had felt his affection for mankind withering away,
                    and that long walks out in the open fields brought his feelings of love back to
                    him.</p>
                <p>This inevitability of suffering and despair – anyway, here I am again, recovered
                    for a period – I’m thankful for it.</p>
                <p>I’m writing you this letter bit by bit in intervals when I’m tired of painting.
                    Work is going quite well – <work origin="existing" stage="middle">I’m struggling
                        with a canvas begun a few days before my indisposition. A reaper, the study
                        is all yellow, terribly thickly impasted, but the subject was beautiful and
                        simple.</work> I then saw in this reaper – a vague figure struggling like a
                    devil in the full heat of the day to reach the end of his toil – I then saw the
                    image of death in it, in this sense that humanity would be the wheat being
                    reaped. So if you like it’s the opposite of that Sower I tried before. But in
                    this death nothing sad, it takes place in broad daylight with a sun that floods
                    everything with a light of fine gold. Good, here I am again, however I’m not
                    letting go, and I’m trying again on a new canvas. <good_health>Ah, I could
                        almost believe that I have a new period of clarity ahead of
                        me.</good_health>
                </p>
                <p>And what should I do – continue here for these months, or move – I don’t know.
                        <bad_health>The thing is, when the crises present themselves they aren’t
                        amusing, and to risk having an attack like that with you or others is
                        serious.</bad_health>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <work mention="vague">My dear brother – I’m still writing to you between bouts
                        of work – I’m ploughing on like a man possessed, more than ever I have a
                        pentup fury for work,</work>
                    <good_health>and I think that this will contribute to curing me.</good_health>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <bad_health>Perhaps something will happen to me like the thing E. Delacroix
                        speaks of – “I found painting when I had neither teeth nor breath left”, in
                        this sense that my sad illness makes me work with a pentup fury – very
                        slowly – but from morning till night without respite – and – this is
                        probably the secret – work for a long time and slowly.</bad_health> What do
                    I know about it, but I think that I have one or two canvases on the go that
                    aren’t too bad, first the reaper in the yellow wheat, and the portrait on a
                    light background.<stress reason="career"> This will be for the Vingtistes, if
                        indeed they remember me when the time comes. Now, it would be absolutely the
                        same to me, if not preferable, if they forget me.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>Since I myself don’t forget the inspiration that I gain from giving free rein to
                    my memories of certain Belgians. That’s the positive thing, and the rest is so
                    secondary.</p>
                <p>And here we are in September already, we’ll soon be in the middle of autumn, and
                    then winter.</p>
                <p>
                    <bad_health>I’ll carry on working very hard, and then if the crisis returns
                        towards Christmas we’ll see, and once that’s over then I wouldn’t see any
                        disadvantage in sending the management here to all the devils and coming
                        back to the north for a fairly long time. Leaving now would perhaps be too
                        unwise, when I consider a new crisis likely in the winter, i.e. in 3
                        months.</bad_health>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="environment">I haven’t set a foot outside for 6 weeks, not even
                        in the garden.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>I’ll try, though, next week, when I’ve finished the canvases in progress.</p>
                <p>But another few months and I’ll be so flabby and stupefied that a change will
                    probably do a lot of good.</p>
                <p>That, for the moment, is my idea on the subject, of course it isn’t a fixed
                    idea.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="friendship">But am of the opinion that we shouldn’t put
                        ourselves out any more with the people of this establishment than with the
                        owners of a hotel. We’ve rented a room from them for a certain amount of
                        time, and they’re well paid for what they give, and that’s absolutely
                        all.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>Not to mention the fact that perhaps they’d like nothing better than for the
                    situation to be chronic, and one would be culpably stupid if one gave in to them
                    on that.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="money">For my taste, they make far too many enquiries about not
                        only what I but you earn &amp;c.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>So let’s give them the slip. Without quarrelling.</p>
                <p>I’m still continuing this letter between times. <work origin="new" stage="middle"
                        >Yesterday I began the portrait of the chief orderly,</work>
                    <work origin="new" stage="planned">and perhaps I’ll also do his wife, for he’s
                        married and lives in a little farmhouse a stone’s throw from the

                </p>
                <p>A most interesting figure. There’s a beautiful etching by Legros of an old
                    Spanish nobleman, if you remember it that will give you an idea of the type. He
                    was at the hospital in Marseille during 2 episodes of cholera, anyway he’s a man
                    who has seen an enormous number of people die and suffer, and there’s an
                    indefinable contemplation in his face, such that I can’t help recalling the face
                    of Guizot – for there’s something of that one in this head – but different. But
                    he’s a man of the people, and simpler. Anyway, you’ll see it if I succeed in it
                    and if I do a repetition of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <bad_health>I’m struggling with all my energy to master my work, telling myself
                        that if I win this it will be the best lightning conductor for the
                        illness.</bad_health>
                    <stress reason="friendship">I take great care of myself by carefully shutting
                        myself away; it’s selfish if you like, not to become accustomed to my
                        companions in misfortune here instead, and to go to see them,</stress>
                    <stress reason="career">but anyway I feel none the worse for it, for my work is
                        progressing and we have need of that, for it’s more than necessary that I do
                        better than before, which wasn’t sufficient.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>Isn’t it better that if I were to come back from here again, sooner or later, I
                    come back decidedly capable of doing a portrait that has some character, than to
                    come back as I left? It’s coarsely expressed, for I really feel that one can’t
                    say ‘I can do a portrait’ without telling a lie, because that is infinite. But
                    anyway you’ll understand what I want to say, that I must do better than
                    before.</p>
                <p>
                    <good_health>At the moment my mind is functioning regularly and I feel
                        absolutely normal – and if I think rationally at present about my condition
                        with the hope of having in general between the crises</good_health> – if,
                    unfortunately, it’s to be feared that this will always recur from time to time –
                    of having periods of clarity and work between times – if I think rationally </p>
                <p> at present about my condition then certainly I tell myself that I mustn’t have
                    the idée fixe of being ill. But that I must continue my little career as a
                    painter firmly. To remain for good in an asylum from now on would probably be
                    exaggerating things.</p>
                <p>I was reading in Le Figaro a few days ago a story of a Russian writer who lived
                    with a nervous illness from which he, moreover, sadly died, which caused him
                    terrible attacks from time to time.</p>
                <p>
                    <bad_health>And what can one do, there’s no remedy, or if there is it’s to work
                        passionately. I dwell on that more than I should. And all in all I prefer to
                        have a proper illness like this than to be as I was in Paris when it was
                        brewing.</bad_health>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <work origin="existing" stage="finished">Also you’ll see this when you put the
                        portrait with the light background which I’ve just finished beside those I
                        did of myself in Paris, that at present I look healthier than then, and even
                        a great deal more so.</work>
                </p>
                <p>I’m even inclined to believe that the portrait will tell you better than my
                    letter how I am, and that it will reassure you – it cost me some trouble.</p>
                <p>And then the reaper is working too I think – it’s very, very simple.</p>
                <p>
                    <work mention="vague">At the end of the month you can rely on 12 no. 30 canvases
                        I dare say, but there will be almost the same ones twice, the study and the
                        final painting.</work>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="environment">Anyway later – perhaps my journey into the south
                        will bear fruit however, because the difference of the stronger light, the
                        blue sky, that teaches one to see, and then above all and even only when one
                        sees that for a long time.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>The north will certainly appear completely new to me, but I’ve looked so much at
                    the things that I’ve become strongly attached to them, and </p>
                <p>
                    <bad_health>I’ll remain melancholy for a long time.</bad_health>
                </p>
                <p>I’m thinking of a funny thing. Modern art is discussed in Manette Salomon, and
                    some artist or other speaking of ‘what will remain’ says: what will remain are
                    ‘the landscape artists’ – that had a grain of truth, because Corot, Daubigny,
                    Dupré, Rousseau – Millet as a landscape painter, that lasts, and when Corot says
                    on his deathbed: in a dream I saw landscapes with completely pink skies, it was
                    charming; then – very good – in Monet, Pissarro, Renoir we see those completely
                    pink skies, so the landscape painters do last well, that was darned true. Let’s
                    leave aside the figure painting of Delacroix, of Millet.</p>
                <p>Afterwards, what are we beginning to glimpse timidly at the moment that is
                    original and lasting – the portrait. That’s something old, one might say – but
                    it’s also brand new. We’ll talk more about this – but let’s still continue to
                    seek out portraits, above all of artists, like the Guillaumin and Guillaumin’s
                    portrait of a young girl, and take good care of my portrait by Russell, which
                    means a lot to me.</p>
                <p>Have you framed the Laval portrait, you haven’t told me what you thought of it I
                    think, I found it marvellous, that gaze through the pincenez, such an honest
                    gaze.</p>
                <p>The will that I have to do portraits these days is terribly strong, anyway
                    Gauguin and I used to chat about that and about similar questions in such a way
                    as to stretch our nerves to the extinction of all vital warmth.</p>
                <p>But out of that, however, a few good paintings must emerge I dare think, and
                    we’re seeking them and they must, I imagine, be doing good work in Brittany.
                        <unstress reason="friendship">I’ve received a letter from G., I think I’ve
                        already told you, and I’m very curious to see what they’re doing one
                        day.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>I must ask you for the following painting items. 10 metres canvas</p>
                <p>Large tubes 6 tubes zinc white</p>
                <p>,, ,, 2 ,, emerald green</p>

                <p>6 fitch brushes, black hair.</p>
                <p>Then I’ve promised the orderly here an issue of Le Monde Illustré, Issue 1684, 6
                    July 1889, in which there’s a very pretty engraving after DemontBreton.</p>

                    <work origin="existing" stage="finished">Phew – the reaper is finished, I think
                        it will be one that you’ll place in your home – it’s an image of death as
                        the great book of nature speaks to us about it – but what I sought is the
                        ‘almost smiling’. It’s all yellow except for a line of violet hills – a
                        pale, blond yellow.</work> I myself find that funny, that I saw it like that
                    through the iron bars of a cell.</p>
                <p>Ah well, do you know what I hope for once I set myself to having some hope, it’s
                    that the family will be for you what nature is for me, the mounds of earth, the
                    grass, the yellow wheat, the peasant. That’s to say that you find in your love
                    for people the wherewithal not only to work but the wherewithal to console you
                    and restore you when one needs it. <stress reason="family">So please don’t let
                        yourself be exhausted too much by business matters but take good care of
                        yourselves, both of you – perhaps in a nottoodistant future there’s still
                        some good.</stress>

                    I’ll work on that with as much pleasure and more calm than for the Vingtistes,
                    that goes without saying, since I’m feeling strong you can be sure that I’m
                    going to try to get through a lot of work. I’m taking the best there are from 12
                    subjects, so they’ll still have things that are a little studied and chosen. And
                    then there is good in working for people who don’t know what a painting is.</p>

            <ps>
                <p> I’m opening this letter once more to tell you that I’ve just seen Mr Peyron, I
                    hadn’t seen him for 6 days. He tells me that he’s planning to go to Paris this
                    month and that he’ll see you then. That gives me pleasure, for he has, there’s
                    no doubt about it, a lot of experience, and I think he’ll tell you what he
                    thinks of it quite frankly.</p>
                <p>
                    <bad_health>To me he only said – ‘let’s hope that it won’t recur’, but anyway
                        I’m counting on it recurring for quite a long time, for a few years at
                        least.</bad_health>
                    <good_health>But I’m also counting on the fact that work, far from being
                        impossible for me, can go along steadily in the meantime, and is even my
                        remedy.</good_health> And so I say once more – excluding Mr Peyron the
                    doctor absolutely – that as regards the management here we should probably be
                    polite, but that we should limit ourselves to that but bind ourselves to
                    nothing.</p>
                <p>It’s very serious that wherever I were to stay here for a little longer I would
                    perhaps come up against popular prejudices – I don’t even know what these
                    prejudices are – which would make my life with them unbearable.</p>
                <p>But anyway, I’m awaiting what Mr Peyron will say to you, myself I have no idea
                    what his opinion is. <work origin="existing" stage="middle">I worked this
                        afternoon on the portrait of the orderly, which is progressing.</work> If it
                    weren’t very much tempered – completely – by an intelligent gaze and an
                    expression of kindness – he would be a real bird of prey. He really is a
                    southern type.</p>
                <p>I’m curious if Mr Peyron’s planned journey will indeed take place this time, I’m
                    very curious to know what may come of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="career">With another year’s work, perhaps I’ll arrive at a
                        feeling of selfsecurity from the artistic point of view. And that’s always
                        something worth seeking.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>But for that I must have good luck. What I dream of in my best moments aren’t so
                    much dazzling colour effects as the halftones once again.</p>
                <p>And certainly the visit to the Montpellier museum contributed to turning my
                    thoughts in that direction. For what touched me there more than the magnificent
                    Courbets, which are marvels, the young ladies of the village, the sleeping
                    spinner – were the portraits of Bruyas by Delacroix and by Ricard, then the
                    Daniel, Delacroix’s odalisques, all in halftones. For these odalisques are
                    something quite different from those in the Louvre. It’s above all purplish.</p>
                <p>But in these halftones what choice and what quality!</p>
                <p>It’s time for me to send off this letter at last – I could tell you in two pages
                    what it contains, i.e. nothing new. But anyway, I don’t have time to redo
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="money">Good handshake once again, and if it doesn’t put you out
                        too much let me have the canvas as soon as possible.</stress>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>I think your letter is really good, what you say about Rousseau and artists like
                    Bodmer, that they are men in any case, and of such a kind that one would wish
                    the world populated with people like that – yes indeed, that’s what I myself
                    feel too.</p>
                <p>And that J.H. Weissenbruch knows and does the muddy towpaths, the stunted
                    willows, the foreshortenings and the learned and strange perspectives of the
                    canals ‘as Daumier does his lawyers’, I think that’s perfect. Tersteeg did well
                    to buy some of his work from him, the fact that people like that don’t sell,
                    according to me that’s because there are too many sellers who try to sell other
                    things, with which they deceive the public and mislead them.</p>
                <p>Do you know that today, still, when I read by chance the story of some energetic
                    industrialist or above all a publisher, that the same feelings of indignation
                    then come to me again, the same feelings of anger from the old days when I was
                    with G.&amp;Cie.</p>
                <p>
                    <work mention="vague">Life goes on like that, time doesn’t come back, but I’m
                        working furiously, because of the very fact that I know that the
                        opportunities to work don’t come back.</work>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="career">Above all, in my case, where a more violent crisis may
                        destroy my ability to paint forever.</stress>
                    <bad_health>In the crises I feel cowardly in the face of anguish and suffering –
                        more cowardly than is justified,</bad_health>
                    <good_health>and it’s perhaps this very moral cowardice which, while before I
                        had no desire whatsoever to get better, now makes me eat enough for two,
                        work hard, take care of myself in my relations with the other patients for
                        fear of relapsing – anyway I’m trying to get better now like someone who,
                        having wanted to commit suicide, finding the water too cold, tries to catch
                        hold of the bank again.</good_health>
                </p>
                <p>My dear brother, you know that I came to the south and threw myself into work for
                    a thousand reasons.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="environment">To want to see another light, to believe that
                        looking at nature under a brighter sky can give us a more accurate idea of
                        the Japanese way of feeling and drawing. Wanting, finally, to see this
                        stronger sun, because one feels that without knowing it one couldn’t
                        understand the paintings of Delacroix from the point of view of execution,
                        technique, and because one feels that the colours of the prism are veiled in
                        mist in the north.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>All of this remains somewhat true. <unstress reason="friendship">Then when one
                        also adds to it an inclination of the heart towards this south that Daudet
                        did in Tartarin, and the fact that here and there I’ve also found friends

                    <bad_health>Will you then understand that while finding my illness
                        horrible</bad_health>
                    <unstress reason="friendship">I feel that all the same I’ve entered into
                        attachments that are a little too strong here – attachments which could mean
                        that later on the desire to work here will take hold of me again – while all
                        the same it may well be that I’ll return to the north relatively
                        soon.</unstress>

                <p>
                    <stress reason="friendship">Yes, for I don’t hide from you the fact that in the
                        same way that I’m taking my food avidly at present, I have a terrible desire
                        that comes to me to see my friends again and to see the northern countryside
                        again.</stress>

                <p>
                    <work mention="vague">Work is going very well, I’m finding things that I’ve
                        sought in vain for years, and feeling that I always think of those words of
                        Delacroix that you know, that he found painting when he had neither breath
                        nor teeth left.</work>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="career">Ah well, I myself with the mental illness I have, I
                        think of so many other artists suffering mentally, and I tell myself that
                        this doesn’t prevent one from practising the role of painter as if nothing
                        had gone wrong.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>When I see that crises here tend to take an absurd religious turn, I would almost
                    dare believe that this even necessitates a return to the north. Don’t speak too
                    much about this to the doctor when you see him – but I don’t know if this comes
                    from living for so many months both at the hospital in Arles and here in these
                    old cloisters. Anyway I ought not to live in surroundings like that, the street
                    would be better then. I am not indifferent, and in the very suffering religious
                    thoughts sometimes console me a great deal. Thus this time during my illness a
                    misfortune happened to me – that lithograph of Delacroix, the Pietà, with other
                    sheets had fallen into some oil and paint and got spoiled.</p>
                <p>
                    <work origin="new" stage="middle">I was sad about it – then in the meantime I
                        occupied myself painting it, and you’ll see it one day, on a no. 5 or 6
                        canvas I’ve made a copy of it which I think has feeling</work> – besides,
                    having not long ago seen the Daniel and the Odalisques and the Portrait of
                    Bruyas and the Mulatto woman at Montpellier, I’m still under the impression that
                    it had on me. This is what edifies me, as does reading a fine book like one by
                    Beecher Stowe or Dickens. But what disturbs me is constantly seeing those good
                    women who believe in the Virgin of Lourdes and make up things like that, and
                    telling oneself that one is a prisoner in an administration like that, which
                    very willingly cultivates these unhealthy religious aberrations when it ought to
                    be a matter of curing them. So I say, it would be even better to go, if not into
                    penal servitude then at least into the regiment.</p>
                <p>I reproach myself for my cowardice, I ought to have defended my studio better,
                    even if I had to fight with those gendarmes and neighbours. Others in my
                    position would have used a revolver, and indeed, had one killed onlookers like
                    that as an artist one would have been acquitted. I would have done better in
                    that case then, and now I was cowardly and drunk.</p>
                <p>Ill too, but I wasn’t brave. </p>
                <p>
                    <bad_health>Then in the face of the Suffering of these crises I feel very
                        fearful too, and so I don’t know if my zeal is something other than what I
                        say, it’s like the man who wants to commit suicide, and finding the water
                        too cold he struggles to catch hold of the bank again.</bad_health>
                </p>
                <p>But listen – to be in a lodginghouse like I saw Braat back then – fortunately
                    that time is far off, no and again no.</p>
                <p>It would be different if père Pissarro or Vignon, for example, wanted to take me
                    into their home. Well I’m a painter myself – that can be sorted out, and better
                    that the money goes to feed painters than to the excellent nuns.</p>
                <p>Yesterday I asked Mr Peyron point blank: since you’re going to Paris, what would
                    you say if I suggested that you be good enough to take me with you? He answered
                    in an evasive way – that it was too quick, that he must write to you
                    beforehand.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="friendship">But he’s very kind and very indulgent towards me,
                        and whilst he isn’t the absolute master here, far from it, I owe him many
                        freedoms.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>Anyway, one must not only make paintings but one must also see people and – from
                    time to time, by associating with others too, recover one’s temperament and
                    furnish oneself with ideas. <bad_health>I leave aside the hope that it wouldn’t
                        recur – on the contrary I must tell myself that from time to time I’ll have
                        a crisis.</bad_health> But then one might for that time go into an asylum or
                    even to the town prison, where there’s usually an isolation cell. Don’t worry
                    yourself in any case – <work mention="vague">work is going well</work> and look,
                        <good_health>I can’t tell you how much it gives me a warm glow sometimes to
                        say, I’m going to do this and that again, wheatfields &amp;c.</good_health>

                <p>
                    <work origin="existing" stage="finished">I’ve done the portrait of the orderly,
                        and I have a repetition of it for you.</work> It makes quite a curious
                    contrast with the portrait I did of myself, in which the gaze is vague and
                    veiled, while he has something military about him, and dark eyes that are small
                    and lively. <work origin="new" stage="planned">I made him a present of it, and
                        I’ll also do his wife if she wants to pose.</work> She’s a faded woman, an
                    unfortunate, quite resigned one, and really not much, and so insignificant that
                    I myself have a great desire to do that dusty blade of grass. <good_health>I
                        spoke with her from time to time when I was doing olive trees behind their
                        little farmhouse, and then she told me that she didn’t think that I was ill
                        – anyway, you would say that too at present if you saw me
                        working</good_health>, with my thoughts clear and my fingers so sure that I
                    drew that Delacroix Pietà without taking a single measurement, though there are
                    those four outstretched hands and arms – gestures and bodily postures that
                    aren’t exactly easy or simple.</p>
                <p>Please send me the canvas soon, if that’s possible, and then I think I’ll need 10
                    tubes of zinc white as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <bad_health>However, I know quite well that recovery comes, if one is brave,
                        from inside, through the great resignation to suffering and death, through
                        the abandonment of one’s own will and one’s selflove. But it’s not coming to
                        me, I love to paint, to see people and things and everything that makes up
                        our life – artificial – if you like. Yes, real life would be in something
                        else, but I don’t think I belong to that category of souls who are ready to
                        live and also at any moment ready to suffer.</bad_health>
                </p>
                <p>What a funny thing the touch is, the brushstroke. Out of doors, exposed to the
                    wind, the sun, people’s curiosity, one works as one can, one fills one’s canvas
                    regardless. Yet then one catches the true and the essential – that’s the most
                    difficult thing. But when one returns to this study again after a time, and
                    orders one’s brushstrokes in the direction of the objects – certainly it’s more
                    harmonious and agreeable to see, and one adds to it whatever one has of serenity
                    and smiles. </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="career">Ah, I’ll never be able to render my impressions of
                        certain figures I’ve seen here.</stress> Certainly the road to the south is
                    the road where there’s something brand new, but men of the north have difficulty
                    in getting through. And I can see myself already in advance, on the day when I
                    have some success, longing for my solitude and distress here when I see the
                    reaper in the field below through the iron bars of the isolation cell. Every
                    cloud has a silver lining.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="career">To succeed, to have lasting prosperity, one must have a
                        temperament different from mine, I’ll never do what I could have and ought
                        to have wanted and pursued.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>But as I have dizzy spells so often, I can only live in a situation of the fourth
                    or fifth rank. While I clearly sense the value and originality and superiority
                    of Delacroix, of Millet, for example, then I make a point of telling myself, yes
                    I am something, I can do something. But I must have a basis in these artists,
                    and then produce the little I’m capable of in the same direction.</p>
                <p>So père Pissarro has been really cruelly struck by those two misfortunes at the
                    same time.</p>
                <p>As soon as I read that I had this idea of asking you if there would be a way of
                    going to stay with him.</p>
                <p>If you pay him the same thing as here, he’ll find it worth his while, for I don’t
                    need much – except for working.</p>
                <p>So do it directly, and if he doesn’t want to I would willingly go to
                    Vignon’s.</p>
                <p>I’m a little afraid of PontAven, there are so many people there. But what you say
                    about Gauguin interests me a lot. <unstress reason="friendship">And I still tell
                        myself that G. and I will perhaps work together again. I myself know that G.
                        can do things even better than what he has done, but how to reassure
                        him!</unstress>
                    <work stage="planned" origin="new">I still hope to do his portrait.</work> Have
                    you seen that portrait he did of me painting sunflowers? My face has lit up
                    after all a lot since, but it was indeed me, extremely tired and charged with
                    electricity as I was then. </p>
                <p>And yet to see the country one must live with the common people and in the little
                    houses, the bars &amp;c. And that was what I said to Boch, who complained of
                    seeing nothing that tempted him or made an impression on him. I go walking with
                    him for two days and I show him thirty paintings to do, as different from the
                    north as Morocco would be. I’m curious to know what he’s doing at the
                    moment.</p>
                <p>And then do you know why the paintings of E. Delacroix – the religious and
                    historical paintings, Christ’s barque – the Pietà, the Crusaders, have this
                    allure? Because E. Delacroix, when he does a Gethsemane, went to see on the spot
                    beforehand what an olive grove was like, and the same for the sea whipped up by
                    a hard mistral, and because he must have said to himself, these people whom
                    history talks to us about, doges of Venice, crusaders, apostles, holy women,
                    were of the same type and lived in a manner analogous to those of their
                    presentday descendants.</p>
                <p>So I must tell you it, and you can see it in the Berceuse, however failed and
                    weak that attempt may be. <stress reason="career">Had I had the strength to
                        continue, I’d have done portraits of saints and of holy women from life, and
                        who would have appeared to be from another century and they would be
                        citizens of the present day, and yet would have had something in common with
                        very primitive Christians.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <bad_health>The emotions that that causes are too strong though, I wouldn’t
                        survive it – but later, later, I don’t say that I won’t mount a fresh
                        attack.</bad_health>
                </p>
                <p>What a great man Fromentin was – for those who want to see the orient he will
                    always remain the guide. He was first to establish relationships between
                    Rembrandt and the south, between Potter and what he saw himself.</p>
                <p>You’re right a thousand times over – one mustn’t think about all that – one must
                    do – even if it’s studies of cabbages and salad to calm oneself down, and after
                    being calmed then – what one is capable of. </p>
                <p>When I see them again I’ll do repetitions of that study of <work
                        origin="existing" stage="planned">the Tarascon diligence,</work>
                    <work origin="existing" stage="planned">the Vineyard,</work>
                    <work origin="existing" stage="planned">the Harvest</work> and above all <work
                        origin="existing" stage="planned">the Red bar</work>, that night café which
                    is the most characteristic as regards colour. <work origin="existing"
                        stage="middle">But the white figure in the middle, correct as regards
                        colour, must be redone, better constructed.</work> But I dare say that this
                    is a bit of the real south, and a calculated combination of the greens with the
                    reds.</p>
                <p>My strength has been exhausted too quickly, but I can see from afar the
                    possibility for others to do an infinity of beautiful things. And again and
                    again that idea remains true, that to facilitate the journey of others it would
                    have been good to found a studio somewhere in these parts.</p>
                <p>To make the journey from the north to Spain in one go, for example, isn’t good,
                    one won’t see there what one ought to see – one must first and gradually
                    accustom one’s eyes to the different light.</p>
                <p>I myself have no great need to see works by Titian and Velázquez in museums, I’ve
                    seen certain living types who have made me know better now what a painting of
                    the south is than before my little journey.</p>
                <p>My God, my God, the good people among artists who say that Delacroix is not of
                    the true orient! Look, is the true orient then what Parisians like Gérôme
                    do?</p>
                <p>Because you paint a bit of sunny wall, even from life and well and true according
                    to our northern way of seeing, does that also prove that you’ve seen the people
                    of the orient? Now that’s what Delacroix was seeking there, which didn’t prevent
                    him at all from painting walls in the Jewish wedding and the Odalisques.</p>
                <p>Isn’t that true – and then Degas says that it’s too expensive to drink in the
                    bars while doing paintings, I don’t say no, but would he then have me go into
                    the cloisters or the churches, there I’m the one who’s afraid.</p>
                <p>That’s why I make an effort at escape through the present letter, with many

                    hesitate to ask it of you.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="environment">Yes we must be done here, I can no longer do both
                        things at once, working and doing everything in my power to live with the
                        odd patients here – it’s unsettling. I’d like to force myself to go
                        downstairs, but in vain. And yet it’s almost 2 months since I’ve been out in
                        the open air.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>In the long run here I would lose the faculty to work, now there I begin to call
                    a halt, and so I’ll send them packing, if you agree. And paying for it what’s
                    more, no, then one or the other of the artists fallen in misfortune will consent
                    to set up house with me.</p>
                <p>Fortunately, you can write that you’re well, and Jo too, and that her sister is
                    with you. I’d very much like to be back myself when your child arrives – not
                    with you, certainly not, that isn’t possible, but in the area around Paris with
                    another painter.</p>
                <p>I could, to mention a third, go and stay with the Jouves, who have a lot of
                    children and a whole household.</p>
                <p>You’ll understand that I’ve tried to compare the second crisis with the first,
                    and I say only this to you: it appears to me to be some kind of influence from
                    outside rather than a cause that comes from within myself. I may be mistaken,
                    but whatever the case I think you’ll consider it right that I’m a little
                    horrified by all religious exaggeration. I can’t help thinking of good André
                    Bonger, who himself let out loud shouts when anyone wanted </p>
                <p> to try out some unguent or other on him. Good Mr Peyron will tell you heaps of
                    things, about probabilities and possibilities of involuntary actions. Good, but
                    if he’s specific I’ll believe none of it. And we’ll see then what he specifies,
                    if it’s specific. <stress reason="environment">The treatment of the patients in
                        this hospital is certainly easy to follow, even on a journey, for they do
                        absolutely nothing about it, they leave them to vegetate in idleness and
                        feed them with stale and slightly spoiled food.</stress> And I’ll tell you
                    now that from the first day I refused to take this food, and until my crisis I
                    ate nothing but bread and a little soup, which I’ll continue to do as long as I
                    remain here. It’s true that after this crisis Mr Peyron gave me some wine and
                    meat, which I willingly accept in these first days but wouldn’t want to make an
                    exception to the rule for a long time, and it’s right to respect the
                    establishment according to their ordinary regime. I must also say that Mr Peyron
                    doesn’t give me much hope for the future, which I find justified, he makes me
                    really feel that everything is doubtful, that nothing can be ensured in advance.
                    But I myself am counting on it recurring, but only work preoccupies me so
                    thoroughly that I think that with the body I have it will continue like this for
                    a long time. The idleness in which these poor unfortunates vegetate is a plague,
                    and there you are, it’s a general evil in the towns and country areas under this
                    stronger sun, and having learned differently it’s a duty to resist it, certainly
                    for me. I finish this letter by thanking you again for yours and asking you to
                    write to me again soon, and many handshakes in thought.</p>

            </head>
            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Thanks very much for your letter. First, it gives me very great pleasure that
                    you, for your part, had also already thought of père Pissarro.</p>
                <p> You’ll see that there are other possibilities, if not there then elsewhere. Now
                    business is business, and you ask me to answer categorically – and you’re right
                    to do so – if I would consent to go into an asylum in Paris in the event of
                    moving immediately for this winter.</p>
                <p>I answer yes to that, with the same calmness and for the same reasons as I
                    entered this one – even though this asylum in Paris might not be ideal, which
                    might easily be the case, for the opportunity to work isn’t bad here, and work
                    my only distraction.</p>
                <p>But that being said, I’ll point out to you that in my letter I gave a very
                    serious motive as a reason for wishing to move.</p>
                <p>And I insist on repeating it – I’m astonished that with the modern ideas I have,
                    I being such an ardent admirer of Zola, of De Goncourt and of artistic things
                    which I feel so much, I have crises like a superstitious person would have, and
                    that mixedup, atrocious religious ideas come to me such as I never had in my
                    head in the north.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="environment">On the assumption that, very sensitive to
                        surroundings, the already prolonged stay in these old cloisters which are
                        the Arles hospital and the home here would be sufficient in itself to
                        explain these crises – then – even as a stopgap – it might be necessary to
                        go into a lay asylum at present.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>Nevertheless, to avoid doing or appearing to do anything rash, I declare to you,
                    after having thus warned you of what I might desire at a given moment – that is,
                    a move – I declare to you that I feel sufficiently calm and confident to wait </p>
                <p> a while longer to see if there’ll be a new attack this winter.</p>
                <p>But if then I was to write to you: I want to get out of here, you wouldn’t
                    hesitate and it would be arranged in advance, for you would know then that I’d
                    have a serious reason, or even several, to go into a home that wasn’t run like
                    this one by the nuns, however excellent they might be.</p>
                <p>Now if by some arrangement or another we might move sooner or later, then let’s
                    begin as if almost nothing was wrong, at the same time being very prudent and
                    ready to listen to the least thing that Rivet has to say, but let’s not set
                    ourselves immediately to taking overly official measures as if it were a lost
                    cause.</p>
                <p>As regards eating a lot, I’m doing so – but if I was my doctor I would forbid
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="career">Not seeing any good for myself in really enormous
                        physical strength, for if I absorb myself in the idea of doing some good
                        work and wanting to be an artist and nothing but that, that would be the
                        most logical thing.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="family">Mother and Wil, each for their part after Cor’s
                        departure, have changed surroundings – they were darned right. Grief mustn’t
                        build up in our souls like the water of a swamp.</unstress> But it’s
                    sometimes both costly and impossible to move.</p>
                <p>Wil wrote very well, it’s a great grief for them, Cor’s departure.</p>
                <p>It’s funny, just at the moment when I was making that copy of the Pietà by
                    Delacroix I discovered where that canvas has gone. It belongs to a queen of
                    Hungary or another country around there who has written poems under the name of
                    Carmen Sylva. The article which talked of her and of the painting was by Pierre
                    Loti, who made one feel that this Carmen Sylva was as a person yet more touching
                    than what she writes – and yet she </p>
                <p> writes things like this: A woman without a child is like a bell without a
                    clapper – the sound of the bronze would perhaps be very beautiful, but no one
                    will hear it.</p>
                <p>
                    <work mention="vague">At present I have 7 copies out of ten of Millet’s Travaux
                        des champs.</work>
                </p>
                <p>I can assure you that it interests me enormously to make copies, and that not
                    having any models for the moment it will ensure, however, that I don’t lose
                    sight of the figure.</p>
                <p>What’s more, it will give me a studio decoration for myself or another.</p>
                <p>
                    <work origin="new" stage="planned">I would like also to copy the Sower</work>
                    and <work origin="new" stage="planned">the Diggers.</work>
                </p>
                <p>There’s a photo of the Diggers after the drawing.</p>
                <p>And Lerat’s etching of the Sower at DurandRuel’s.</p>
                <p>In these same etchings is the Field under the snow with a harrow. Then The four
                    times of the day, there are examples of them in the collection of wood
                    engravings.</p>
                <p>I would like to have all of this, at least the etchings and the wood engravings.
                    It’s a study I need, for I want to learn. Although copying may be the old
                    system, that absolutely doesn’t bother me at all. I’m going to copy Delacroix’s
                    Good Samaritan too.</p>
                <p>
                    <work origin="new" stage="finished">I’ve done a portrait of a woman – the
                        orderly’s wife – which I think you’d like.</work>
                    <work origin="existing" stage="finished">I’ve done a repetition of it which
                        wasn’t as good as the one from life.</work>
                </p>
                <p>And I fear that they’ll take the latter, I would have liked you to have it. It’s
                    pink and black.</p>
                <p>
                    <work origin="new" stage="finished">Today I’m sending you my portrait of myself,
                        you must look at it for some time – you’ll see, I hope, that my physiognomy
                        has grown much calmer, although the gaze may be vaguer than before, so it
                        appears to me.</work>
                </p>
                <p>I have another one which is an attempt from when I was ill. But I think this one
                    will please you more, and I’ve tried to create something simple, show it to père
                    Pissarro if you see him.</p>
                <p> You’ll be surprised what effect the Travaux des champs take on in colour, it’s a
                    very intimate series of his.</p>
                <p>What I’m seeking in it, and why it seems good to me to copy them, I’m going to
                    try to tell you. We painters are always asked to compose ourselves and to be
                    nothing but composers.</p>
                <p>Very well – but in music it isn’t so – and if such a person plays some Beethoven
                    he’ll add his personal interpretation to it – in music, and then above all for
                    singing – a composer’s interpretation is something, and it isn’t a hard and fast
                    rule that only the composer plays his own compositions.</p>
                <p>
                    <good_health>Good – since I’m above all ill at present, I’m trying to do
                        something to console myself, for my own pleasure.</good_health>
                </p>
                <p>I place the blackandwhite by Delacroix or Millet or after them in front of me as
                    a subject. And then I improvise colour on it but, being me, not completely of
                    course, but seeking memories of their paintings – but the memory, the vague
                    consonance of colours that are in the same sentiment, if not right – that’s my
                    own interpretation.</p>
                <p>Heaps of people don’t copy. Heaps of others do copy – for me, I set myself to it
                    by chance, and I find that it teaches and above all sometimes consoles.</p>
                <p>So then my brush goes between my fingers as if it were a bow on the violin and
                    absolutely for my pleasure. <work origin="new" stage="finished">Today I

                </p>
                <p>The first four canvases are studies that don’t have the effect of an ensemble
                    like the others. Myself I quite like the Entrance to a quarry which I did when I
                    felt this attack beginning, because to my taste the dark greens go well with the
                    ochre tones, there’s something sad in them that’s healthy, and that’s why it
                    doesn’t annoy me. That’s perhaps also the case with the Mountain. People will
                    tell me that mountains aren’t like that, and that there are black contours as
                    wide as a finger. But anyway it seemed to me that it expressed the passage in
                    Rod’s book – one of the very rare passages of his in which I find something good
                    – on a lost land of dark mountains in which one noticed the darkish huts of
                    goatherds, where sunflowers bloomed.</p>
                <p>The olive trees with white cloud and background of mountains, as well as the
                    Moonrise and the Night effect –</p>
                <p>These are exaggerations from the point of view of the arrangement, their lines
                    are contorted like those of the ancient woodcuts. The olive trees are more in
                    character, just as in the other study and I’ve tried to express the time of day
                    when one sees the green beetles and the cicadas flying in the heat.</p>
                <p>The other canvases – the Reaper &amp;c. aren’t dry. And now in the bad season I’m
                    going to make a lot of copies, for really I must do more figure work. It’s the
                    study of the figure that teaches one to grasp the essential and to simplify.</p>
                <p>When you say in your letter that I’ve never done anything but work, no – that’s
                    not right – <stress reason="career">I myself am very, very discontented with my
                        work, and the only thing that consoles me is that experienced people say
                        that one must paint for 10 years for nothing.</stress> But what I’ve done is
                    only those 10 years of unfortunate studies that didn’t come off. Now a better
                    period could come, but I’ll have to strengthen the figure work, and I must
                    refresh my memory by very close study of Delacroix, Millet. Then I’ll try to
                    sort out my drawing. Yes, every cloud has a silver lining, it gives one more
                    time for study.</p>
                <p>
                    <work mention="vague">I’m also adding a study of flowers to the roll of canvases
                        – not much, but anyway I don’t want to tear it up.</work>
                </p>
                <p>All in all the only things I consider a little good in it are the Wheatfield, the
                    Mountain, the Orchard, the Olive trees with the blue hills and the Portrait and
                    the Entrance to the quarry, and the rest says nothing to me, because it lacks
                    personal will, feeling in the lines. Where these lines are close together and
                    deliberate the painting begins, even if it may be exaggerated. That’s what
                    Bernard and Gauguin feel a little bit, they won’t ask for the correct shape of a
                    tree at all, but they absolutely insist that one says if the shape is round or
                    square – and my word, they’re right –</p>
                <p>Exasperated by certain people’s photographic and inane perfection. They won’t ask
                    for the correct tone of the mountains but they’ll say: for Christ’s sake, were
                    the mountains blue, then chuck on some blue and don’t go telling me that it was
                    a blue a bit like this or like that, it was blue wasn’t it? Good – make them
                    blue and that’s enough! Gauguin is a genius sometimes when he explains that, but
                    as for the genius Gauguin has, he’s very timid about showing it, and it’s
                    touching how he likes to say something really useful to young folk. What an odd
                    fellow all the same.</p>
                <p>It gives me great pleasure that Jo is well, and I think you’ll feel much more in
                    your element thinking of her pregnancy, and naturally having concerns about it
                    too, than if you were alone without these family concerns. For you’ll feel more
                    in nature.</p>
                <p>When one thinks of Millet and Delacroix, what a contrast. Delacroix without a
                    wife, without children, Millet completely in his family, more than anyone.</p>
                <p>And yet what similarities there are in their work.</p>
                <p>So Jouve has still kept his big studio and he’s working on decorations.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="friendship">That one came very close to being an excellent
                        painter. It’s money troubles with him, in order to eat he’s forced to do a
                        thousand things other than painting, which costs him more money than it
                        brings in when he makes something beautiful.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>And he quickly loses his touch for drawing with the brush. This probably comes
                    from the old training method, which is the same as the current one – in the
                    studios – they fill in outlines. And Daumier was always painting his face in the
                    mirror to learn how to draw!</p>
                <p>Do you know what I think about quite often – what I used to say to you back in
                    the old days, that if I didn’t succeed I still thought that what I had worked on
                    would be continued. Not directly, but one isn’t alone in believing things that
                    are true. And what does one matter as a person then? I feel so strongly that the
                    story of people is like the story of wheat, if one isn’t sown in the earth to
                    germinate there, what does it matter, one is milled in order to become
                    bread.</p>
                <p>The difference between happiness and unhappiness, both are necessary and useful,
                    and death or passing away... it’s so relative – and so is life.</p>
                <p>Even in the face of an illness that’s unsettling or worrying, this belief is
                    absolutely unshaken.</p>
                <p>I’d have liked to see those Meuniers.</p>
                <p>Well, let it be understood that if I were to write to you again expressly and
                    briefly that I wanted to come to Paris, I would have a reason for that, which
                    I’ve explained above, that in the meantime there’s no great hurry, and I’m quite
                    confident, after warning you, to wait for the winter and the crisis which may
                    recur then. But if I have another fit of religious exaltation, then no delay,
                    I’d like to leave immediately without giving a reason. Only we have no right, at
                    least it would be indiscreet, to meddle in the nuns’ management or even to
                    criticize them. They have their own belief and ways of doing good to others,
                    sometimes it works very well. But I don’t warn you lightly. And it isn’t to
                    regain more freedom or something else that I don’t have. So let’s wait very
                    calmly until an opportunity presents itself to find a place.</p>
                <p>It’s a great advance that my stomach is working well, and so I don’t think that
                    I’ll be as sensitive to the cold. Then I know what to do when the weather is
                    bad, as I have this plan to copy several things that I like.</p>
                <p>I’d very much like to see Millet reproductions in schools, I think there would be
                    children who became painters if only they saw good things.</p>
                <p>Give my warm regards to Jo, and handshake, more soon. </p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>I was longing for your letter and so I was very happy to receive it, and to see
                    from it that you’re well, as are Jo and the friends you speak of.</p>
                <p>I must ask you to send me the whites I asked for as soon as possible, and to add
                    to them some canvas, 5 metres or 10, whichever suits. Then I must begin by
                    telling you a piece of rather vexing news, as I see it. <stress reason="money"
                        >It’s that during the stay here there have been a few expenses which I
                        thought Mr Peyron had notified you about as they occurred, which he told me
                        the other day he hadn’t done, with the result that it has mounted up to
                        around 125 francs, deducting from it the 10 you sent by postal
                        order.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>It’s for paint, canvas, frames and stretching frames, my trip the other day to
                    Arles, a piece of linen clothing, and various repairs.</p>
                <p>I’m using two colours here, lead white and ordinary blue, but in quite large
                    quantities, and the canvas, that’s for when I want to work on unprepared,
                    stronger canvas.</p>
                <p>This comes unfortunately just at this time when I would gladly have repeated my
                    trip to Arles etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="environment">That said, I’ll tell you that we’re having some
                        superb autumn days, and that I’m taking advantage of them.</unstress>
                    <work origin="new" stage="finished">I have a few studies, among others a
                        mulberry tree, all yellow on stony ground standing out against the blue of
                        the sky, in which study I think that you’ll see that I’ve found Monticelli’s
                        track.</work>
                    <work mention="vague">You’ll have received the consignment of canvases I sent
                        you last Saturday.</work>
                </p>
                <p>It surprises me a lot that Mr Isaäcson wants to do an article on studies of mine.
                    I’d willingly urge him to wait a little longer, his article would lose
                    absolutely nothing by it, and with another year of work I could hope to put more
                    characteristic things in front of him with more willpower in the drawing, more
                    knowledge of the Provençal south. </p>
                <p>Mr Peyron was very kind to talk of my case in those terms – I haven’t dared ask
                    him to go to Arles one of these days, which I’d very much like to do, believing
                    that he would disapprove. Not, though, that I suspected that he believed there
                    was a connection between my previous trip and the crisis that closely followed
                    it. <stress reason="friendship">The thing is that there are a few people over
                        there whom I felt and once again feel the need to see again.</stress>
                </p>
                <p> While I don’t have here in the south, like good Prévost , a mistress who holds
                    me captive, I couldn’t help becoming attached to people and things.</p>
                <p>And now that I’m staying on here for the time being, and will most probably spend
                    the winter here – in the spring – in the fine season, shall I not stay here too?
                    That will depend on my health above all.</p>
                <p>What you say of Auvers is nevertheless a very agreeable prospect to me, and
                    sooner or later that ought to be fixed without seeking further. If I come to the
                    north, even supposing that there’s no room in this Doctor’s home, it’s probable
                    that he would, on père Pissarro’s recommendation and your own, find either board
                    with a family or quite simply at the inn. The main thing is to know the doctor
                    so that, in the event of a crisis, one doesn’t fall into the hands of the police
                    and isn’t forcibly carried off into an asylum.</p>
                <p>And I can assure you that the north will interest me like a brandnew country. </p>
                <p>But anyway, for the moment there’s therefore nothing that’s absolutely hurrying
                    us.</p>
                <p>I reproach myself for being so behind with my correspondence, I’d like to write
                    to Isaäcson, Gauguin and Bernard. But writing doesn’t always come, and what’s
                    more, work is pressing. Yes, I’d like to say to Isaäcson that he would do well
                    to wait longer, there isn’t yet that in it that I hope to attain if my health
                    continues. It’s not worth mentioning anything about my work at the moment. When
                    I’m back, at best it will form a kind of ensemble, ‘Impressions of
                    Provence’.</p>
                <p>But what does he want to say now when the olive trees, the fig trees, the
                    vineyards, the cypresses must be more accentuated, all characteristic things,
                    the same as the Alpilles, which must get more character.</p>
                <p>How I’d like to see what Gauguin and Bernard have brought back.</p>
                <p>
                    <work origin="new" stage="finished">I have a study of two yellowed poplars on a
                        background of mountains, and a view of the park here, autumnal effect, some
                        of the draughtsmanship of which is more naive and more – at home.</work>
                </p>
                <p>Anyway, it’s difficult to leave a land before having something to prove that one
                    has felt and loved it. </p>
                <p>
                    <work origin="new" stage="planned">If I come back to the north I plan to do a
                        whole lot of Greek studies, you know, painted studies with white and blue
                        and only a little orange, just like in the open air.</work>
                </p>
                <p>I must draw and seek style. Yesterday at the almoner’s here I saw a painting that
                    made an impression on me. A Provençal lady with an intelligent, purebred face,
                    in a red dress. A figure like the ones Monticelli thought of.</p>
                <p>It wasn’t without great faults, but there was simplicity in it, and how sad it is
                    to see how much they have degenerated from it here, as we have from ours in
                    Holland.</p>
                <p>I’m writing to you in haste so as not to wait to answer your kind letter, hoping
                    that you’ll write again without delaying long.</p>
                <p>I’ve seen more very beautiful subjects for tomorrow – in the mountains.</p>
                <p>Kind regards to Jo and to our friends, above all when you get the chance thank
                    père Pissarro for his information, which will certainly be useful.</p>
                <p>Shaking both your hands, believe me</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>
                    <work origin="existing" stage="finished">I’ve just brought back a canvas I’ve
                        been working on for some time, once again of the same field as the one of
                        the reaper.</work> Now it’s mounds of earth and the background parched
                    lands, then the rocks of the Alpilles. A bit of bluegreen sky with small white
                    and violet cloud. In the foreground: A thistle and some dry grass. A peasant
                    dragging a bundle of straw in the middle. It’s another harsh study, and instead
                    of being almost entirely yellow it makes an almost completely violet canvas.
                    Broken and neutral violets.</p>
                <p>But I’m writing you this because I think that this will complement the reaper and
                    will make it easier to see what it is. For the reaper appears done at random,
                    and this with it will balance it. <work origin="existing" stage="finished">As
                        soon as it’s dry I’ll send it to you with the repetition of the
                        bedroom.</work> I seriously ask you to show them together, if someone or
                    other comes to see the studies, because of the opposition of the
                    complementaries.</p>
                <p>
                    <work origin="new" stage="finished">Then this week I’ve done the entrance to a
                        quarry, which is like a Japanese thing, you’ll well remember that there are
                        Japanese drawings of rocks where grasses and little trees grow here and
                        there.</work> There are moments between times when nature is superb,
                    autumnal effects glorious in colour, green skies contrasting with yellow,
                    orange, green vegetation, earth in all shades of violet, burnt grass where the
                    rains have nevertheless given a last vigour to certain plants, which again start
                    to produce little violet, pink, blue, yellow flowers. Things that make you quite
                    melancholy not to be able to render them.</p>
                <p>And the skies – like our northern skies, but the colours of the sunsets and
                    sunrises are more varied and more pure. As in works by Jules Dupré and Ziem.</p>
                <p>
                    <work origin="new" stage="finished">I also have two views of the park and the
                        asylum in which this place appears most agreeable.</work> I tried to
                    reconstruct the thing as it may have been by simplifying and accentuating the
                    proud, unchanging nature of the pines and the cedar bushes against the blue. </p>
                <p>Anyway – if they should happen to remember me – which I’m not keen on – there’ll
                    be enough to send something coloured to the Vingtistes. But I’m indifferent to
                    that. What I’m not indifferent to is that a man who is far superior to me,
                    Meunier, has painted the female thrutchers of the Borinage and the shift going
                    to the pit and the factories, their red roofs and their black chimneys against a
                    delicate grey sky – all things I’ve dreamed of doing, feeling that it hadn’t
                    been done and that it ought to be painted. And still, there’s an infinite number
                    of subjects there for artists, and one should go down into the depths and paint
                    the light effects.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="career">If you haven’t yet sent the canvas and the colours, you
                        should know that I now have absolutely no canvas.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="money">And I was going to ask you if you would find it difficult
                        to send the amount of what I owe to Mr Peyron immediately, if it was
                        possible for you then to send me about fifteen francs by postal order, I
                        would go to Arles one of these days.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="friendship">It often seems to me that if Gauguin had remained
                        here he wouldn’t have lost anything, for I clearly see, also in the letter
                        he wrote me, that he isn’t entirely at the top of his form.</stress> And I
                    know well the cause of that – they’re too hard up to find models, and living as
                    cheaply as he thought possible at the beginning won’t have lasted. However, with
                    his patience, next year will perhaps be dazzling. But then he won’t have Bernard
                    with him if the latter does his military service.</p>
                <p>Do you sense how much the figures of Jules Breton and Billet and others will
                    remain? Those people overcame the difficulty of models, and that’s a lot. And a
                    painting like that by Otto Weber from the good period (not the English) is bound
                    to hold its own. One swallow doesn’t make a summer, and one new idea doesn’t in
                    any way destroy works that have been done and perfected. That’s the terrible
                    thing about the Impressionists, that the development of the thing gets stuck,
                    and that for years they’re left facing obstacles that the preceding generation
                    had overcome, the difficulty of money and models. And so Breton, Billet and
                    others really are certain to mock it and be astonished and say: ‘come on, when
                    are we going to see your peasants and your peasant women?’ As for me, I feel
                    ashamed and defeated.</p>
                <p>
                    <work origin="new" stage="finished">I’ve copied that woman with a child sitting
                        beside a hearth by Mrs DemontBreton, almost all violet,</work> I’m certainly
                    going to continue copying, it will give me a collection of my own, and when it’s </p>
                <p> sufficiently large and complete I’ll give the whole lot to a school.</p>
                <p>I can also tell you that next consignment you’ll become better acquainted with
                    good Tartarin’s Alpilles, which up to now – apart from the canvas of the
                    mountains – you haven’t yet seen unfold, except in the distant background of the
                    canvases. <work origin="new" stage="finished">I have a study, rougher than the
                        previous one of the mountains. A very wild ravine where a slender stream
                        weaves its way along its bed of rocks.</work>
                </p>
                <p>It’s all violet. I could certainly do an entire series of these Alpilles, for
                    having seen them for a long time now I’ve got used to it a little. You remember
                    that fine landscape by Monticelli that we saw at Delarebeyrette’s, of a tree on
                    some rocks against a sunset. There are a lot of effects like that at the moment,
                    only I can’t ever be outside at the time the sun sets, otherwise I would have
                    tried it.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="family">Does Jo continue in good health? I think that all in
                        all this year is happier for you than the preceding ones.</unstress>
                    <good_health> As for me, my health has been good lately – I really think that Mr
                        Peyron is right when he says that strictly speaking I’m not mad, for my
                        thoughts are absolutely normal and clear between times, and even more than
                        before, but during the crises it’s terrible however, and then I lose
                        consciousness of everything.</good_health> But it drives me to work and to
                    seriousness, as a coalminer who is always in danger makes haste in what he does.
                    Our mother and sister will be making their preparations to move house.</p>
                <p>I’m enclosing a note for Isaäcson, Bernard and Gauguin. Naturally there’s no
                    urgency at all to get it to them. The first time they come to see you will
                    suffice. In the evenings I’m bored to death, my God the prospect of winter isn’t
                    a cheery one.</p>
                <p>I hope that you’ll have received the canvases sent about ten days ago in good
                    order.</p>
                <p>I’m going off for a long hike in the mountains to look for sites. More soon –
                    above all send the paint and the canvas if it hasn’t been sent, for I’ve no
                    canvas left at all, nor any zinc white.</p>
                <p>Kind regards to Jo.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Enclosed I’m sending you a list of colours I need as soon as possible.</p>
                <p>
                    <good_health>You gave me very great pleasure by sending me those
                        Millets</good_health>,<work origin="new" stage="middle"> I’m working on them
                        zealously.</work> I was growing flabby by dint of never seeing anything
                    artistic, and this revives me. <work stage="finished" origin="existing">I’ve
                        finished The evening</work> and <work origin="new" stage="middle">am working
                        on The diggers and the man who’s putting his jacket on, no. 30 canvases, and
                        The sower, smaller.</work> The evening is in a range of violets and soft
                    lilacs, with light from the lamp pale citron, then the orange glow of the fire
                    and the man in red ochre. You will see it. It seems to me that doing painting
                    after these Millet drawings is much rather to translate them into another
                    language than to copy them. Apart from that I have a rain effect on the go, and
                    an evening effect with tall pines. And also a leaffall.</p>
                <p>
                    <good_health>My health is very good</good_health> – <bad_health>except often a
                        lot of melancholy however</bad_health> – <unstress reason="environment">but
                        I feel much much better than when I came here, and even better than in
                        Paris.</unstress>
                    <unstress reason="career"> Also, as for the work the ideas are becoming firmer,
                        it seems to me.</unstress> But then I don’t quite know if you’d like what
                    I’m doing now. For despite what you say in your previous letter, that the search
                    for style often harms other qualities, the fact is that I feel myself greatly
                    driven to seek style, if you like, but I mean by that a more manly and more
                    deliberate drawing. If that will make me more like Bernard or Gauguin, I can’t
                    do anything about it. But am inclined to believe that in the long run you’d get
                    used to it. For yes, one must feel the wholeness of a country – isn’t that what
                    distinguishes a Cézanne from something else. And Guillaumin, whom you mention,
                    he has so much style and a personal way of drawing. Anyway, I’ll do as I
                    can.</p>
                <p>Now that most of the leaves have fallen the landscape looks more like the north,
                    and then I really feel that if I went back to the north I would see it more
                    clearly than before.</p>
                <p>Health is a big thing, and a lot depends on it, as regards work too.</p>
                <p>
                    <good_health>Fortunately those abominable nightmares no longer torment
                        me.</good_health>
                </p>
                <p>I hope to go to Arles in the next few days.</p>
                <p>I’d very much like Jo to see The evening, I think that I’ll send you a
                    consignment shortly, but it’s drying very badly because of the dampness of the
                    studio. Here the houses have scarcely any cellar or foundations, and one feels
                    the damp more than in the north.</p>
                <p>At home they’ll have moved by now, I’ll add 6 canvases for them to the next
                    consignment. Is it necessary to have them framed, perhaps not, for it isn’t
                    worth it. Above all, don’t frame the studies I send you from time to time, that
                    can be done later, pointless for them to take up too much room. <work
                        stage="finished" origin="new">I’ve also done a canvas for Mr Peyron, a view
                        of the house with a tall pine tree.</work>
                </p>
                <p>I hope that your health and Jo’s continue to be good.</p>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="family">I’m so happy that you’re no longer alone, and that
                        everything’s more normal than before.</unstress>
                </p>
                <p>Is Gauguin back, and what’s Bernard doing?</p>
                <p>More soon, I shake your hand firmly, and Jo’s, and our friends’, and believe
                    me</p>
            </body>
            <close>Ever yours,</close>
            <sig>Vincent</sig>
            <ps>
                <p>I’m trying to simplify the list of colours as much as possible – thus I very
                    often use the ochres as in the old days. </p>
                <p> I know very well that the studies drawn with long, sinuous lines from the last
                    consignment weren’t what they ought to become, however I dare urge you to
                    believe that in landscapes one will continue to mass things by means of a
                    drawing style that seeks to express the entanglement of the masses. Thus, do you
                    remember Delacroix’s landscape, Jacob’s struggle with the angel? And there are
                    others of his! For example the cliffs, and the very flowers you speak of
                    sometimes. Bernard really has found perfect things in there. Anyway, don’t be
                    too swift to adopt a prejudice against it. </p>
                <p>
                    <work origin="new" stage="middle">Anyway, you’ll see that there’s already more
                        character in a large landscape with pines, red ochre trunks defined by a
                        black line than in the previous ones.</work>

            <salutation>My dear Theo, </salutation>
            <body>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="family">I have to thank you very much for a consignment of
                        colours, which was also accompanied by an excellent woollen
                        waistcoat.</unstress> How kind you are to me, and how I’d like to be able to
                    do something good in order to prove to you that I’d like to be less ungrateful.
                    Your colours reached me at the right moment, for what I brought back from Arles
                    is almost exhausted. The thing is, I’ve been working this month in the olive
                    groves, for they’d driven me mad with their Christs in the garden, in which
                    nothing is observed. Of course there’s no question of me doing anything from the
                    Bible – and I’ve written to Bernard, and also to Gauguin, that I believed that
                    thinking and not dreaming was our duty, that I was therefore astonished when
                    looking at their work by the fact that they give way to that. For Bernard has
                    sent me photos of his canvases. The thing about them is that they’re sorts of
                    dreams and nightmares, that there’s some erudition there – one can see that it’s
                    someone who’s mad about the primitives – but frankly the English PreRaphaelites
                    did this much better, and then Puvis and Delacroix are much healthier than those
                    PreRaphaelites. So this doesn’t leave me cold, but it gives me an uncomfortable
                    feeling of a tumble rather than progress. Well, to shake this off, I’ve been
                    messing about in the groves morning and evening on these bright and cold days,
                    but in very beautiful, clear sunshine, and the result is 5 no. 30 canvases
                    which, with the 3 studies of olive trees that you have, at least constitute an
                    attack on the problem. The olive tree is variable like our willow or pollard in
                    the north. <work origin="new" stage="middle">You know that willows are very
                        picturesque, despite the fact that it appears monotonous, it’s the tree
                        typical of the country. Now what the willow is in our native country, the
                        olive tree and the cypress have exactly the same importance here. What I’ve
                        done is a rather harsh and coarse realism beside their abstractions, but it
                        will nevertheless impart the rustic note, and will smell of the soil.</work>
                    How I’d like to see the studies from nature by Gauguin and Bernard, the latter
                    tells me of portraits which doubtless would please me more. <work
                        stage="planned" origin="new">I hope I’ll get used to working in the cold –
                        in the morning there are very interesting effects of white frost and fog,
                        and I still have the great desire to do for the mountains and for the
                        cypresses what I’ve just done for the olive trees, have a really good go at
                        them.</work>
                </p>
                <p>The thing is, the olive tree and the cypress have rarely been painted, and from
                    the point of view of placing the paintings this ought to go to England, I know
                    well enough what they’re looking for over there. Whatever the case, I’m almost
                    sure that in this way I’ll do something passable from time to time. As I said to
                    Isaäcson, it’s really more and more my opinion that by working assiduously from
                    nature, without saying to oneself in advance, I want to do this or that, by
                    working as if one were making shoes, without artistic preoccupations, one won’t
                    always do well, but on the days when one thinks about it the least one finds a
                    subject that holds its own with the work of those who came before us. <stress
                        reason="career">One learns to know a country that’s basically quite
                        different from what it appears at first sight. On the contrary, one will say
                        to oneself, I want to finish my paintings better, I want to do them with
                        care; in the face of the difficulties of the weather, of changing effects, a
                        heap of ideas like this finds itself reduced to being impracticable, and I
                        end up resigning myself by saying, it’s experience and each day’s little bit
                        of work alone that in the long run matures and enables one to do things that
                        are more complete or more right. </stress>So slow, long work is the only
                    road, and all ambition to be set on doing well, false. For one must spoil as
                    many canvases as one succeeds with when one mounts the breach each morning. To
                    paint, the tranquil, regulated life would therefore be absolutely necessary, and
                    at present what can one do when one sees that Bernard, for example, is always
                    put under pressure, pressure, pressure by his parents. He can’t do as he wants,
                    and many others with him. One says to oneself, I shan’t paint any more, but what
                    will one do then? <stress reason="money">Ah – a more expeditious painting
                        process should be invented, less expensive than oil and yet
                        durable.</stress> A painting... it will end up becoming as commonplace as a
                    sermon, a painter like someone who’s a century behind the times. It’s a shame,
                    though, that it should be so. Now if the painters had better understood Millet
                    as a man – now some like Lhermitte and Roll have grasped him – things wouldn’t
                    be so. One must work as hard and with as few pretensions as a peasant if one
                    wants to last. And instead of putting on grandiose exhibitions, it would have
                    been better to address oneself to the common people, and work so that everyone
                    may have paintings or reproductions at home, which are lessons like the work of
                    Millet.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="money">I’m completely at the end of my canvas, and when you can
                        please send me 10 metres.</stress>
                    <work origin="new" stage="planned">Then I’m going to attack the cypresses and
                        the mountains.</work> I think that this must be the centre of the work I’ve
                    done here and there in Provence, and then we can conclude the stay here when
                    it’s convenient. Which isn’t urgent, for Paris only distracts, after all. I
                    don’t know, though, not always being a pessimist – <work stage="planned"
                        origin="new">I keep telling myself that I still have it in my heart to paint
                        a bookshop one day with the shop window yellowpink, in the evening, and the
                        passersby black – it’s such an essentially modern subject</work>. Because it
                    also appears such a figurative source of light. I say, that would be a subject
                    that would look good between an olive grove and a wheatfield, the sowing of
                    books, of prints. I have that very much in my heart to do, like a light in the
                    darkness. Yes, there’s a way of seeing Paris as beautiful. But anyway, bookshops
                    aren’t hares, and there’s no hurry, and I have a good will to work here for
                    another year, which will probably be wiser.</p>
                <p>Mother must have been in Leiden for a good fortnight by now.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>
                    <work origin="new" stage="finished">Yesterday I sent three packets by parcel
                        post containing studies which I hope you’ll receive in good order.</work> I
                    really must thank you for the 10 metres of canvas, which have just arrived.</p>
                <p>
                    <work stage="finished" origin="new">Among the studies you’ll find the following,
                        which are for our mother and sister. Olive trees – Bedroom – Reaper –
                        Working with plough – Wheatfield with cypresses – Orchard in blossom –
                        Portrait.</work>
                </p>
                <p>The remainder is above all autumn studies and I think the best one is the yellow
                    mulberry tree against a very blue sky. Then the study of the house and of the
                    park, of which there are two variants. <work origin="new" stage="middle">The
                        studies on no. 30 canvases weren’t yet dry and will follow later. They’re
                        giving me a lot of trouble, and sometimes I find them very ugly, sometimes
                        they look good to me – perhaps you’ll have the same impression when you see
                        them. There are a dozen of them, so it’s more substantial than what I’ve
                        just sent.</work>
                </p>
                <p>In spite of the cold I’m continuing to work outside up to now, and I think that
                    it’s good for me and for the work.</p>
                <p>
                    <work stage="finished" origin="new">The last study I did is a view of the
                        village – where people were at work – under enormous plane trees – repairing
                        the pavements. So there are piles of sand, stones and the gigantic
                        treetrunks – the yellowing foliage, and here and there glimpses of a
                        housefront and little figures.</work>
                    <stress reason="family">I often think of you and Jo, but with a feeling as if
                        there was an enormous distance from here to Paris and as if it were years
                        since I saw you.</stress> I hope that your health is good, for myself I
                    can’t complain, I feel absolutely normal, so to speak, but without ideas for the
                    future, and truly I don’t know what it’s going to be, and perhaps I’m avoiding
                    going into this question deeply, sensing that I can do nothing about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <work origin="new" stage="middle">I’ve finished, or almost, the copy of The
                        diggers too.</work>
                </p>
                <p>You’ll see that there are no more impastos in the large studies. I prepare the
                    thing with sorts of washes with spirits, and then proceed with touches or
                    hatchings of colour with spaces between them. This imparts atmosphere and uses
                    less paint.</p>
                <p>If I want to send this letter off today I must hurry, so handshake in thought and
                    warm regards to Jo.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo, </salutation>
            <body>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="friendship">Yesterday I was pleasantly surprised by a visit
                        from Mr Salles who, I believe, had had a letter from you. I was completely
                        well when he came so we were able to talk calmly.</unstress> But I’m most
                    confused that he should have put himself out for me, the more so because I hope
                    that I’ve regained my presence of mind for a while. For the moment it seems to
                    me that the best thing will be to carry on here. I’ll see what Mr Peyron says
                    when I have a chance to speak to him; he’ll probably say that he absolutely
                    cannot guarantee anything in advance, which seems quite right to me.</p>
                <p>Today I’m dispatching a few canvases, the following:<work origin="new"
                        stage="finished">Ploughed field with background of mountains – it’s the same
                        field of the reaper from this summer and can be a pendant to it; I think
                        that one will set off the other.</work>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <work stage="finished" origin="new">The ravine. This is the study done on a day
                        when the mistral was blowing – I had wedged my easel in place with large
                        stones – the painting of this isn’t dry, it’s in a tauter drawing style, and
                        there’s more suppressed passion and it has more colour.</work>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <work origin="new" stage="finished">This can go with another study of mountains,
                        summer effect, with a road in the foreground and a black hovel.</work>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <work stage="finished" origin="new">Women picking olives – I’d intended this
                        painting for our mother and sister so that they might have something a
                        little studied.</work>
                </p>
                <p>I also have a repetition of it for you, and the study (more coloured with more
                    solemn tones) from nature.</p>
                <p>
                    <work origin="new" stage="finished">The fields. Fields of young wheat with
                        background of lilac mountains and yellowish sky.</work>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <work stage="finished" origin="new">Olive trees. Orange and green sunset sky
                        (there’s also a variant of it here with figures)</work>.</p>
                <p>ditto, neutral effect.</p>
                <p>ditto ,, ,,.</p>
                <p>
                    <work origin="new" stage="finished">The tall plane trees, the main street or
                        boulevard of StRémy, study from nature – I have a repetition of it here
                        which is perhaps more finished.</work>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <work stage="finished" origin="new">Copy after Millet, The diggers.</work>
                </p>
                <p>ditto <work origin="new" stage="finished">The evening.</work> I was forgetting
                    the rain. Please don’t look at them without putting them on stretching frames
                    and framing them in white.</p>
                <p>That’s to say, you’ll remove the nails from other canvases and mount these on the
                    stretching frames, one by one if you like, to appreciate the effect. For the
                    colourings absolutely need to be set off by the white frame to judge the
                    ensemble. Thus the rain, the grey olive trees, one can scarcely see them without
                    the frame.</p>
                <p>This will somewhat fill the hole left by the canvases that have gone off to the
                    Vingtistes – you must ask Tanguy to remove the nails from other canvases and to
                    mount these on stretching frames so that they dry all the way through.</p>
                <p>In your previous letter you talk of Hugo’s drawings – I’ve just seen a volume of
                    Michelet’s (illustrated) Histoire de France. I saw admirable drawings in it by
                    Vierge which were completely like something by Victor Hugo, astonishing things.
                    Do you know that? When you see Mr Lauzet ask him if he knows them, there’s also
                    a resemblance with Hervier’s talent, but more complete, with more dramatic
                    figures and effects – it also resembles the illustrations for The life of
                    Frederick the Great by Menzel. Most curious.</p>
                <p>I think that Vierge has also gone to Charenton, but how that fellow has worked.
                    At one time Boggs had a magnificent wood engraving of his, probably published by
                    L’Illustration, Seabathing – a crowd of men and women – drawing in the manner of
                    Doré, who one day did precisely the same subject very well on a page also
                    published by L’Illustration – but then with Vierge there’s Daumier’s rich
                    execution in full.</p>
                <p>I hope that Jo’s health and yours are good, and that you no longer have any
                    anxiety on my account.</p>
                <p>Write to me if you can soon after receiving the canvases. Good handshake in
                    thought to you and your wife.</p>

                <location>Saint-Rémy-de-Provence</location>, Wednesday, <date>12 February
                    1890</date>.</head>
            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>I was in the middle of writing to you to send you the reply for Mr Aurier when
                    your letter arrived. <unstress reason="family">Am very pleased that Jo and the
                        newborn are well and that she expects to be able to get up in a few days
                        from now.</unstress> Then what you write about our sister also interests me
                    a great deal. I consider that she was lucky to see Degas at his home. I still
                    think that she would above all make a good doctor’s wife. Anyway, one can’t
                    exactly force these things, nevertheless it’s good to have one’s eyes open if
                    the opportunity were to present itself.</p>
                <p>And so Gauguin has come back to Paris – I’m going to copy my reply to Mr Aurier
                    to send it to him, and you can let him read the article from the Mercure. For
                    really I consider that one should say things like that about Gauguin, and about
                    me nothing except very secondarily.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="friendship">Gauguin wrote to me that he’d exhibited in Denmark
                        and that this exhibition had been very successful. To me it seems a shame
                        that he didn’t continue here a bit longer. The two of us together would have
                        worked better than myself all alone this year. And at present we’d have a
                        little cottage of our own to stay in and work, and could even accommodate
                        others.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>Did you notice in that newspaper you sent me an article on the fruitfulness of
                    certain artists. Of Corot, Rousseau, Dupré; do you remember how many times when
                    Reid was there that we talked about that, even of the necessity to produce a
                    lot.</p>
                <p>And that shortly after I came to Paris I said to you that before I had two
                    hundred canvases I wouldn’t be able to do anything. What would appear to some
                    people to be working too fast is in reality completely the ordinary run of
                    things, the normal state of regular production, considering that a painter must
                    work really just as hard as a shoemaker, for example. Would it not be a good
                    idea to send Reid, and perhaps also Tersteeg, or rather C.M., a copy of Aurier’s
                    article?</p>
                <p>The thing is that it seems to me that we ought to take advantage of it to try to
                    place something in Scotland, either now or later.</p>
                <p>
                    <work origin="new" stage="finished">I think you’ll like the canvas for Mr
                        Aurier, it’s in terribly thick impasto and worked like certain Monticellis,
                        I’ve kept it for almost a year.</work>
                </p>
                <p>But I consider that I must try to give him something good for that article, which
                    is in itself a very artistic thing; and it really serves us well for the day
                    when we, like everyone, will be obliged to try and recover what the paintings
                    cost.</p>
                <p>Everything beyond that leaves me quite cold, but recovering the money it costs to
                    produce, that’s the very condition of being able to continue.</p>
                <p>
                    <work stage="middle" origin="new">For the Impressionists’ exhibition in March I
                        hope to send you a few more canvases which are drying at the moment. If they
                        didn’t arrive in time you would have to make a choice from those that are at
                        père Tanguy’s. I’ve tried to copy Daumier’s Drinkers and Doré’s
                        Penitentiary, it’s very difficult.</work>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <work origin="new" stage="planned">In the next few days I hope to begin on
                        Delacroix’s Good Samaritan and Millet’s Woodcutter.</work>
                </p>
                <p>Aurier’s article would encourage me, if I dared let myself go, to risk emerging
                    from reality more and making a kind of tonal music with colour, as some
                    Monticellis are. But the truth is so dear to me, trying to create something true
                    also, anyway I think, I think I still prefer to be a shoemaker than to be a
                    musician, with colours. In any event, trying to remain true is perhaps a remedy
                    to combat the illness that still continues to worry me. Lately my health is
                    quite good, however, and I’d dare to believe that if I were to spend a while
                    with you that would have a lot of effect upon me to counteract the influence
                    that the company I have here necessarily exerts. But it seems to me that there’s
                    no hurry about this, and that we must consider calmly if this is the moment to
                    spend money on the journey. Perhaps by sacrificing the journey one could be
                    useful to Gauguin or Lauzet.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="money">A few days ago I bought a suit that cost me 35 francs, I
                        must pay for it towards the end of March. With this I’ll have sufficient for
                        the year, for when I came here I also bought a suit for around 35 francs,
                        and it has served me all year. But I’ll need a pair of shoes and a few pairs
                        of drawers in March as well.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>All things considered, life here isn’t very expensive, I think that in the north
                    one would spend rather more.</p>
                <p>And that’s why – even if I came to you for a while – the best policy might still
                    be to continue the work here. I don’t know – and either is good to me – but we
                    mustn’t hurry to move.</p>
                <p>And don’t you think that in Antwerp, if we put Gauguin’s plan into practice, one
                    would have to maintain a certain rank, furnish a studio, in short do as the
                    majority of established Dutch painters do? It’s not as simple as it appears, and
                    would fear for him as well as for myself a regular siege by the established
                    artists, and he would have the same story as he had before in Denmark. Anyway,
                    we’d have to begin to say to ourselves that it’s still through the same
                    procedure that the established painters can cause troubles for adventurers, as
                    we’d be in Antwerp, and even oblige them to decamp. And as for the dealers
                    there, we mustn’t count on them at all.</p>
                <p>The academy there is better, and they work more vigorously there than in Paris.
                    And then Gauguin is still in Paris at the moment, his reputation is holding up
                    there, and if he leaves for Antwerp he could find that it’s rather difficult to
                    come back to Paris. Going to Antwerp I would fear for Gauguin rather than for
                    myself, for naturally I can get by in Flemish, I resume the studies of peasants
                    I began before and abandoned with much regret – there’s no need to tell you that
                    I have a great love of the Kempen. But I foresee that for him the battle could
                    be very tough. I think that you’ll tell him the pros and cons of this absolutely
                        as<stress reason="friendship"> I would tell him, I’ll write to him one of
                        these days, especially to send him the reply to Mr Aurier’s article, and I’d
                        think that if he wanted we could still work here together if his steps to
                        find a position were to come to nothing.</stress> But he’s skilful, and
                    perhaps he’ll come through it in Paris itself, and if he holds on there for his
                    reputation he does well, for he always has this, that he was the first one of
                    all to work in the heart of a tropical land. And one will necessarily come back
                    to that matter. Above all, give him my warm regards, and if he wants he can take
                    the repetitions of the Sunflowers and the repetition of the Berceuse in exchange
                    for something of his that would give you pleasure.</p>
                <p>
                    <work stage="planned" origin="existing">If I came to Paris I would have to
                        rework several canvases done in the beginning here, I wouldn’t have any lack
                        of work then.</work> Warm regards to Jo, and good handshake in thought.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>
                    <bad_health>Today I wanted to try and read the letters that had come for me, but
                        I wasn’t yet clearheaded enough to be able to understand them.</bad_health>
                </p>
                <p>However, I’m trying to answer you straightaway, and am hoping that it will lift
                    within a few days from now. Above all I hope that you’re well, and your wife and
                    your child.</p>
                <p>Don’t worry about me, even if it should last a little longer, and write the same
                    thing to those at home and give them my warm regards.</p>
                <p>Warm regards to Gauguin, who wrote me a letter for which I thank him very much,
                    I’m terribly bored but must try to be patient. Once again warm regards to Jo and
                    to her little one, and handshake in thought.</p>
            </body>

                <p>
                    <bad_health>I’m picking up this letter again to try and write, it will come
                        little by little, it’s just that my mind has been so affected – without
                        pain, it’s true – but totally stupefied. </bad_health>I must tell you that
                    there are – as far as I can judge – others who have this like me; who having
                    worked during a period of their life are reduced to powerlessness even so. One
                    doesn’t easily learn anything good between four walls, that’s understandable,
                    but nevertheless it’s true that there are also people who can no longer be left
                    at liberty as if they had nothing wrong with them. And so I almost or entirely
                    despair of myself. Perhaps, perhaps I would indeed get better in the country for
                    a time.</p>
                <p>
                    <work origin="new" stage="middle">Work was going well, the last canvas of the
                        branches in blossom, you’ll see that it was perhaps the most patiently
                        worked, best thing I had done, painted with calm and a greater sureness of
                        touch. </work>And the next day done for like a brute. Difficult to
                    understand things like that, but alas, that’s how it is. I have a great desire
                    to get back to my work, though, but Gauguin also writes that he, who is
                    nevertheless robust, also despairs of being able to continue. And isn’t it true
                    that we often see the story of artists like that. So, my poor brother, take
                    things as they are, don’t grieve on my account, it will encourage me and support
                    me more than you think to know that you’re running your household well. Then,
                    after a time of trial, perhaps days of serenity will return for me too. But in
                    the meantime I’ll send you some canvases soon. Russell also wrote to me, and I
                    think it’s good to have written to him so that he doesn’t forget us completely –
                    for your part speak of him from time to time so that people may know that
                    although he works in isolation he’s a very good man, and I think he’ll do good
                    things as one used to see in England, for example. He’s right a thousand times
                    over to barricade himself in a little.</p>
                <p>Give my regards to the Pissarros, later I’m going to read your letters more
                    calmly, and hope to write again tomorrow or the day after.</p>

            <salutation>My dear brother,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>
                    <good_health>Today, as Mr Peyron had come back, I read your kind letters, then
                        the letters from home as well, and that did me an enormous amount of good in
                        giving me back a little energy, or rather the desire to climb back up again
                        from the dejected state I’m in. </good_health>I thank you very much for the
                    etchings –<unstress reason="environment"> you’ve chosen some of the very ones
                        that I’ve already liked for a long time, the David, the Lazarus, the
                        Samaritan, and the large etching of the wounded man, and you’ve added the
                        blind man and the other very small etching, </unstress>the last one so
                    mysterious that I’m afraid of it and dare not wish to know what it is. I didn’t
                    know it, the little goldsmith. But the Lazarus! Early this morning I looked at
                    it and I remembered not only what Charles Blanc says of it, but indeed even that
                    he doesn’t say everything about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="environment">The unfortunate thing is that the people here are
                        too curious, idle and ignorant about painting for it to be possible for me
                        to practise my profession. </stress>This is what one could always observe,
                    that you and I made an effort here in the same direction as some others who
                    weren’t understood either, and were bitterly saddened by circumstances. If ever
                    you go to Montpellier you would see that what I tell you here is true.</p>
                <p>Now, rather, you propose coming back to the north, and I accept.</p>
                <p>I’ve had too hard a life to kick the bucket as a result, or to lose the power to
                    work.</p>
                <p>So Gauguin and Guillaumin, the two of them, want to do an exchange for <work
                        origin="new" stage="finished">the landscape of the Alpilles. Besides, there
                        are two of them, only I think that the one finished last, which I’ve just
                        sent, is done with more determination and is more accurate in
                        expression.</work>
                </p>
                <p>I’m perhaps going to try to work from the Rembrandts,<work stage="planned"
                        origin="new"> above all I have an idea to do the man at prayer in the range
                        of tones running from bright yellow to violet.</work>
                </p>
                <p>Included is Gauguin’s letter, do what you think best as regards the exchange,
                    take the ones you like for yourself; I’m sure that our taste is increasingly
                    becoming the same.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="career">Ah, if I’d been able to work without this bloody
                        illness! How many things I could have done, isolated from the others,
                        according to what the land would tell me.</stress> But yes – this journey is
                    well and truly finished. Anyway, what consoles me is the great, the very great
                    desire that I have to see you again, you, your wife and your child, and so many
                    friends who have remembered me in my misfortune, as, for that matter, I don’t
                    stop thinking of them either.</p>
                <p>I’m almost sure that I’ll soon get better in the north, at least for quite a long
                    time, while still apprehensive of a relapse in a few years’ time – but not
                    immediately. That’s what I imagine after having observed the other patients
                    here, some of whom are considerably older than I am or, among the young ones,
                    were more or less idlers – students. Anyway, what do we know about it?</p>
                <p>Fortunately the letters from our sister and mother were very calm. Our sister
                    writes very well, and describes a landscape or an aspect of the town as if it
                    were a page from a modern novel. I always urge her to busy herself with domestic
                    rather than artistic things, for I know that she’s already too sensitive, and at
                    her age would have difficulty in finding the way to artistic development. I’m
                    really afraid that she too will suffer from a thwarted artistic will. But she’s
                    so energetic that she’ll make up for it. <stress reason="environment">I talked
                        with Mr Peyron about the situation, and told him that it was almost
                        impossible for me to bear my fate here, that not knowing anything very clear
                        regarding the line to take,</stress> it seemed preferable to me to return to
                    the north.</p>
                <p>If you think this is a good idea, and if you suggest a date when you expect me
                    over there in Paris, I would have someone from here accompany me part of the
                    way, as far as Tarascon or Lyon. Then you would wait for me, or have someone
                    wait for me, at the station in Paris. Do what seems best to you. For the time
                    being I would leave my furniture behind in Arles. <unstress reason="friendship"
                        >It’s with friends, and I’m sure they’d send it the day I wanted it.
                    </unstress>But the carriage and packing would be almost what it’s worth. I
                    consider this as a shipwreck, this journey, well, one can’t do as one wants, and
                    as one ought to either. <unstress reason="environment">Once I got out a little
                        into the park I recovered all my clarity for work, I have more ideas in my
                        head than I could ever put into action, but without it dazzling
                        me.</unstress> The brushstrokes go like a machine. So based on that I dare
                    believe that in the north I would rediscover my confidence once freed from
                    surroundings and circumstances which I neither understand nor wish to
                    understand. It was very kind of Mr Peyron to write to you, he’s writing to you
                    again today, I leave him regretting that I have to leave him. Good handshake to
                    you and to Jo, I thank her very much for her letter.</p>

            <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>
                    <good_health>Once again I’m writing to you to say that I’m staying
                        well</good_health>, yet<stress reason="environment"> I feel a little worn
                        out by this long crisis, </stress>and I dare believe that the planned move
                    will refresh my ideas more.</p>
                <p>I think that it’ll be best for me to go myself to see this doctor in the country
                    as soon as possible; then we can soon decide if I’m going to lodge with him or
                    temporarily at the inn; and thus we’ll avoid an overlong stay in Paris, a thing
                    that I would fear. You remember that 6 months ago I told you after a crisis that
                    if it happened again I would ask you to let me move? <bad_health>We’re at that
                        point – although I don’t feel capable of passing judgement on the way they
                        have of dealing with the patients here – it’s enough that I feel that what
                        remains to me of reason and capacity for work is absolutely in danger.
                    </bad_health>While, on the contrary, I’m confident that I can prove to this
                    doctor you speak of that I still know how to work logically, and he’ll treat me
                    accordingly, and since he likes painting there’s sufficient chance that a solid
                    friendship will result from it.</p>
                <p>I don’t think Mr Peyron will oppose a very prompt departure. Besides, I tell
                    myself that the pleasure of spending a few days with you will do me a lot of
                    good. And from that moment on we can really count on a period of relative
                    health. So don’t delay in taking the necessary steps so that this doesn’t drag
                    on. Once I’m there I can send for my bed, which is in Arles.</p>
                <p>
                    <stress reason="environment">Besides, I would move anyway, preferring to be in
                        an asylum where the patients worked to this awful idleness here, which
                        really seems to me quite simply a crime.</stress> Anyway, you’ll tell me
                    that this is seen more or less everywhere, and that there’s even plenty of it in
                    Paris. Whatever the case, I hope that we’ll see each other again very soon.</p>
                <p>The etchings you sent me are really beautiful. Opposite this I’ve scribbled a
                    croquis after a painting I’ve done of three figures which are in the background
                    of the Lazarus etching.</p>
                <p>
                    <work origin="new" stage="finished">The dead man and his two sisters.The cave
                        and the corpse are violet, yellow, white. The woman who is taking the
                        handkerchief from the resurrected man’s face has a green dress and orange
                        hair, the other has black hair and a striped garment. Green and pink. Behind
                        a countryside, blue hills, a yellow rising sun. The combination of colours
                        would thus itself speak of the same thing expressed by the chiaroscuro of
                        the etching.</work> If I were still to have at my disposal the model who
                    posed for the Berceuse and the other whose portrait you’ve just received after
                    Gauguin’s drawing, then certainly I’d try to execute it in a large size, this
                    canvas, the personalities being what I would have dreamed of as characters. But
                    leaving aside subjects of this kind, there will still remain the study from life
                    of peasants and landscapes when I’m back in the north.</p>
                <p>As regards the order for colours. Should I remain here for another few days,
                    please send off part of it at once. If, however, I leave in the next few days –
                    which I hope – you can keep it in Paris.</p>
                <p>In any event, write to me in the next few days; I hope that you’ll have received
                    the canvases in good order. <work stage="finished" origin="new">I’ve done
                        another one of a nook of greenery which seems to me to have some
                        freshness.</work>
                    <work origin="new" stage="middle">I’ve also attempted a copy of Delacroix’s Good

            <salutation>My dear brother,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>
                    <unstress reason="career">Thanks very much for your registered letter containing
                        150 francs, which arrived this morning. I also received canvases and colours
                        from Tasset Lhote (were those from Tanguy in the same consignment?), and I
                        can’t thank you too much for them, for if I didn’t have my work I’d have
                        sunk far deeper long since.</unstress> A<good_health>t the moment the
                        improvement is continuing, the whole horrible crisis has disappeared like a
                        thunderstorm, and I’m working here with calm, unremitting ardour to give a
                        last stroke of the brush.</good_health>
                    <work origin="new" stage="middle">I’m working on a canvas of roses on bright
                        green background and two canvases of large bouquets of violet Irises, one
                        lot against a pink background in which the effect is harmonious and soft
                        through the combination of greens, pinks, violets. On the contrary, the
                        other violet bouquet (ranging up to pure carmine and Prussian blue) standing
                        out against a striking lemon yellow background with other yellow tones in
                        the vase and the base on which it rests is an effect of terribly disparate
                        complementaries that reinforce each other by their opposition. </work>These
                    canvases will take a good month to dry, but the man who works here will take
                    care of sending them after my departure.</p>
                <p>I’m planning to leave as soon as possible this week, and I’m starting to pack my
                    trunk today.</p>
                <p>I’ll send you a telegram from Tarascon.</p>
                <p>Yes, it seems to me, too, that there’s been a very long period between the day
                    when we said our goodbyes at the railway station and these present days. But –
                    strange thing again that, just as that day we were so struck by Seurat’s
                    canvases, these last days here are once again like a revelation of colour to me.
                    My dear brother, I feel I have more confidence in my work than when I left, and
                    it would be ungrateful of me to speak ill of the south, and I confess that it’s
                    with great sorrow that I turn my back on it.</p>
                <p>If your work prevented you from coming to get me at the station, or if it was at
                    a difficult time or if the weather was too bad, don’t worry, I’d certainly find
                    my way, and I feel so calm that it would greatly astonish me if I lost my
                    composure. How much I want to see you again, and meet Jo and the baby.</p>
                <p>It’s likely that I’ll arrive in Paris around 5 o’clock in the morning. But
                    anyway, the telegram will tell you precisely.</p>
                <p>The day I leave depends on my having packed my trunk and finished my canvases,
                    I’m working on the latter with so much enthusiasm that packing my trunk seems
                    more difficult to me than doing the paintings. Anyway it won’t be long. I’m very
                    glad that it hasn’t dragged on, which is always lamentable when one makes a
                    resolution. I’m very much looking forward to seeing the Japanese prints, and
                    also I don’t at all disdain seeing the Salon, in which it seems to me that
                    there’ll be interesting things all the same, although having read Le Figaro’s
                    account, indeed it leaves me more or less cold.</p>
                <p>Warm regards to Jo, and good handshake in thought.</p>

            <salutation>Dear brother and sister,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Jo’s letter was really like a gospel for me, a deliverance from anguish which I
                    was caused by the rather difficult and laborious hours for us all that I shared
                    with you. It’s no small thing when all together we feel the daily bread in
                    danger, no small thing when for other causes than that we also feel our
                    existence to be fragile. O<bad_health>nce back here I too still felt very
                        saddened, and had continued to feel the storm that threatens you also
                        weighing upon me.</bad_health>
                    <stress reason="family"> What can be done – you see I usually try to be quite
                        goodhumoured, but my life, too, is attacked at the very root, my step also
                        is faltering. I feared – not completely – but a little nonetheless – that I
                        was a danger to you, living at your expense – </stress>but Jo’s letter
                    clearly proves to me that you really feel that for my part I am working and
                    suffering like you.</p>
                <p>
                    <work origin="new" stage="finished">There – once back here I set to work again –
                        the brush however almost falling from my hands and – knowing clearly what I
                        wanted I’ve painted another three large canvases since then. They’re immense
                        stretches of wheatfields under turbulent skies, and I made a point of trying
                        to express sadness, extreme loneliness. </work>You’ll see this soon, I hope
                    – for I hope to bring them to you in Paris as soon as possible, since I’d almost
                    believe that these canvases will tell you what I can’t say in words, what I
                    consider healthy and fortifying about the countryside.</p>
                <p>
                    <work stage="planned" origin="new">Now the third canvas is Daubigny’s garden, a
                        painting I’d been thinking about ever since I’ve been here.</work>
                </p>
                <p>I hope with all my heart that the planned journey may provide you with a little
                    distraction.</p>
                <p>I often think of the little one, I believe that certainly it’s better to bring up
                    children than to expend all one’s nervous energy in making paintings, but what
                    can you do, I myself am now, at least I feel I am, too old to retrace my steps
                    or to desire something else. <bad_health>This desire has left me, although the
                        moral pain of it remains.</bad_health>
                </p>
                <p>I very much regret not having seen Guillaumin again, but it pleases me that he’s
                    seen my canvases.</p>
                <p>If I’d waited for him I would probably have stayed to talk with him in such a way
                    as to miss my train.</p>
                <p>Wishing you luck and good heart and relative prosperity, please tell Mother and
                    Sister sometime that I think of them very often, besides this morning I have a
                    letter from them and will reply shortly.</p>

                    <stress reason="money"> My money won’t last me very long this time, as on my
                        return I had to pay the baggage costs from Arles.</stress> I retain very
                    good memories of this trip to Paris. A few months ago I little dared hope to see
                    our friends again. I thought that Dutch lady had a great deal of talent. </p>
                <p> Lautrec’s painting, portrait of a female musician, is quite astonishing, it
                    moved me when I saw it. </p>

            <salutation>My dear brother,</salutation>
            <body>
                <p>Thanks for your letter of today and for the 50franc note it contained.</p>
                <p>I’d perhaps like to write to you about many things, but first the desire has
                    passed to such a degree, then I sense the pointlessness of it.</p>
                <p>I hope that you’ll have found those gentlemen favourably disposed towards
                    you.</p>
                <p>As regards the state of peace in your household, I’m just as convinced of the
                    possibility of preserving it as of the storms that threaten it. I prefer not to
                    forget the little French I know, and certainly wouldn’t see the point of delving
                    deeper into the rights or wrongs in any discussions on one side or the other.
                    It’s just that this wouldn’t interest me.</p>
                <p>Things go quickly here – aren’t Dries, you and I a little more convinced of that,
                    don’t we feel it a little more than those ladies? So much the better for them –
                    but anyway, talking with rested minds, we can’t even count on that.</p>
                <p>
                    <good_health>As for myself, I’m applying myself to my canvases with all my
                        attention, I’m trying to do as well as certain painters whom I’ve liked and
                        admired a great deal.</good_health>
                    <stress reason="friendship">What seems to me on my return – is that the painters
                        themselves are increasingly at bay.</stress>
                </p>
                <p>Very well. But has the moment to make them understand the utility of a union not
                    rather passed already? On the other hand a union, if it were formed, would go
                    under if the rest went under. Then you’d perhaps tell me that dealers would
                    unite for the Impressionists; that would be very fleeting. Anyway it seems to me
                    that personal initiative remains ineffective, and having done the experiment,
                    would one begin it again?</p>
                <p>I noted with pleasure that the Gauguin from Brittany that I saw was very
                    beautiful, and it seems to me that the others he’s done there must be too.</p>
                <p>
                    <work origin="new" stage="middle">Perhaps you’ll see this croquis of Daubigny’s
                        garden – it’s one of my most deliberate canvases – to it I’m adding a
                        croquis of old thatched roofs and the croquis of 2 no. 30 canvases depicting
                        immense stretches of wheat after the rain.</work> Hirschig asked me to ask
                    you please to order the attached list of colours for him from the same colourman
                    you send me. Tasset can send them directly to him, cash on delivery, but then he
                    would have to be given the 20%.</p>
                <p>Which would be simplest.</p>
                <p>Or you’d put them into the consignment of colours for me, adding the invoice or
                    telling me how much they cost, and then he’d send you the money. Here one can’t
                    find anything good in the way of colours.</p>
                <p>I’ve simplified my own order to a very bare minimum.</p>
                <p>Hirschig is beginning to understand a little, it has seemed to me, he’s done the
                    portrait of the old schoolmaster, which he gave him, good – and then he has
                    landscape studies which are a little like the Konings at your place as regards
                    colour. It will become completely like that, perhaps, or like the things by
                    Voerman that we saw together.</p>
                <p>More soon. Look after yourself, and good luck in business . Warm regards to Jo,
                    and handshakes in thought.</p>
