      <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
      <body><p>On the occasion of the first of May I wish you not too bad a year, and above all good
            health.</p>
      <p>How I’d like to be able to pass on some physical strength to you, I have a feeling of
            having too much of it at the moment. <bad_health>Which doesn’t prevent my mind from not yet being at
            all what it ought to be.</bad_health></p>
      <p>How right Delacroix was, who lived on bread and wine alone, and who succeeded in finding a
            way of life in harmony with his profession. <stress reason="money">But the inevitable question of money always
            remains – Delacroix had a private income. Corot too.</stress></p>
      <p>And Millet – Millet was a peasant and the son of a peasant. You’ll perhaps read with some
            interest the article I’m cutting out of a Marseille newspaper, because in it one
            glimpses Monticelli, and I find the description of the painting of a corner of the
            cemetery extremely interesting. But alas, it’s another stilllamentable story.</p>
      <p>How sad it is to think that a painter who succeeds, even half succeeds, in his turn pulls
            along half a dozen artists who are even greater failures than himself.</p>
      <p>However, think of Pangloss, think of Bouvard and Pécuchet, I know, then even that can be
            explained, but those people perhaps don’t know Pangloss, or else one forgets everything
            one knows about him under the inevitable bite of real despairs and great pains.</p>
      <p>And what’s more, under the name of optimism we fall back into a religion which to me has
            the look of being the rear end of a kind of Buddhism. Nothing bad about that, quite the
            opposite, if you like.</p>
      <p>I don’t much like the article on Monet in Le Figaro, how much better that other article in
            Le 19ième Siècle was! There one saw the paintings, and this one contains only banalities
            that make me melancholy. </p>
      <p><work mention="vague">Today I’m packing up a crate of paintings and studies.</work></p>
      <p>There’s one which is flaking, onto which I’ve stuck newspapers – it’s one of the best and I
            think that when you look at it you’ll see more clearly what my studio, now foundered,
            could have been. This study, as well as a few others, was spoiled by damp during my
            illness.</p>
      <p><stress reason="environment">The water from a flood rose up to a few feet from the house and, more importantly, when I
            came back water and saltpetre were oozing from the walls because the house had been
            without a fire during my absence.</stress></p>
      <p><stress reason="career">That had an effect on me, not only the studio having foundered, but even the studies which
            would have been the memories of it damaged, it’s so final, and my urge to found
            something very simple but durable was so strong.</stress> <bad_health>It was fighting against insurmountable
            odds, or rather it was weakness of character on my part, for I still have feelings of
            grave remorse difficult to define. I think that was the cause of my crying out so much
            during the crises, that I wanted to defend myself and could no longer manage to.</bad_health> For it
            wasn’t for me, it was for the very painters like the unfortunate one spoken of in the
            enclosed article that this studio could have been of use.</p>
      <p>Anyway, there have been more than us before, Bruyas in Montpellier gave an entire fortune
            to it and an entire existence and without the least apparent result.</p>
      <p>Yes – a cold room in a municipal museum where one sees a deeply saddened face and lots of
            fine paintings, where certainly one is moved, but alas moved as in a cemetery. </p>
      <p>However, it would be difficult for one to walk in a cemetery demonstrating more clearly the
            existence of that Hope that Puvis de Chavannes painted.</p>
      <p>The paintings fade like flowers – thus even some Delacroixs had suffered, the magnificent
            Daniel, the Odalisques (quite different from those in the Louvre, it was in a single
            purplish range), but how that impressed me, those paintings that were fading there,
            little understood, it’s true, by the majority of visitors who look at Courbet and
            Cabanel and Victor Giraud &amp;c.</p>
      <p>What are we, we painters? Well, I think that Richepin is often right, for example, when
            going at it pointblank he simply sends them back to the madhouse in his blasphemies.</p>
      <p><stress reason="money">Now, though, I assure you that I know no hospital where one would want to take me for
            nothing, even supposing that I would take upon myself the expenses of my painting and
            would leave all my work to the hospital.</stress></p>
      <p>And that is perhaps, I don’t say a great but anyway a small injustice. I would be resigned
            if I thought that. <unstress reason="family">If I was without your friendship I would be sent back without remorse
            to suicide, and however cowardly I am, I would end up going there.</unstress> <bad_health>There, as you will
            see I hope, is the point where we’re permitted to protest against society and to defend
            ourselves.</bad_health></p>
      <p>You can be reasonably sure that the Marseille artist who committed suicide did not at all
            commit suicide from drinking absinthe, for the simple reason that nobody will have
            offered him any and that he wouldn’t have had </p>
      <p> the means to buy any. Besides, it won’t have been solely for his pleasure that he drank,
            but because being ill already he kept himself going that way.</p>
      <p><stress reason="career">Mr Salles has been to StRémy – they don’t want to allow me painting outside the
            establishment,</stress> <stress reason="money">nor to take me for less than 100 francs.</stress></p>
      <p>So this information is bad indeed. If I could get out of it by enlisting for 5 years in the
            Foreign Legion, I think I’d prefer that.</p>
      <p>For on the one hand being locked up, not working I would recover with difficulty, on the
            other hand we’d be made to pay 100 francs a month all through a madman’s long life.</p>
      <p>It’s serious, and what can one do, let’s think about it. But will they want to take me on
            as a soldier? I feel very tired by the conversation with Mr Salles, and I don’t quite
            know what to do. I myself advised Bernard to do his military service, so is it so
            astonishing that I should think of going to Arabia myself as a soldier.</p>
      <p><stress reason="family">I say this just in case; you shouldn’t blame me too much if I go. The rest is so vague and
            so strange</stress>. <stress reason="money">And you know how doubtful it is that one ever recovers what it costs to do
            painting.</stress> Besides, it seems to me that physically I am well.</p>
      <p>If I can’t work there except under supervision! and in the establishment – is it by God
            worth paying money for that!</p>
      <p>Certainly in the barracks I could then work as well and even better.</p>
      <p>Anyway, I’m thinking, do the same, let’s be aware that everything always happens for the
            best in the best of worlds, that isn’t impossible. I shake your hand very firmly.</p></body>
      <close>Ever yours,</close>
