    <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
    <body><p><unstress reason="friendship">Although I have nothing very, very unexpected to tell you I still want to let you know that
        last Monday I saw our friend Roulin again.</unstress> There was good reason for it too — the whole of
        France having shivered. Certainly in our own eyes the election and its results and its
        representatives are only symbols. But one thing that has been proved once again is that
        worldly ambitions and glories pass — but that up to now the beating of the human heart
        remains the same and as much in touch with the past of our buried fathers as with the
        generation to come.</p>
    <p><unstress reason="friendship">This morning I had a very friendly letter from Gauguin to which I replied without delay.</unstress> <work origin="existing" stage="finished">When
        Roulin came I had just finished the repetition of my sunflowers, and I showed him the two
        examples of the Berceuse between these four bouquets.</work></p>
    <p>Roulin sends you his warm regards.</p>
    <p>On Sunday in Marseille he was present at the crowd’s demonstration when the election result
        was telegraphed from Paris.</p>
    <p>Like Paris, Marseille was moved to the very depth of the depths of the souls of the common
        people, all together and taciturn. Ah well, who will now dare order any cannon, machine gun
        or Lebel rifle to fire when so many hearts have been given in advance to serve as stoppers
        for the cannons?</p>
    <p>All the more so since certainly the victorious politicians of this great day today, Rochefort
        and Boulanger, are with one common accord more ambitious for the cemetery than for any
        throne.</p>
    <p>Anyhow, that was our interpretation of the event, not just Roulin’s and mine but that of many
        others. We were very moved all the same. Roulin told me that he almost wept when he saw that
        silent Marseille crowd, and that he hadn’t recovered his composure until he turned round and
        saw some very, very old friends, who hesitated to recognize him, by sheer chance. They then
        went off to have supper together until late into the night. </p>
    <p>Although he was very tired he wasn’t able to resist the desire to come to Arles to see his
        family again and, almost falling over with tiredness and very pale, he came to shake our
        hands. <work mention="vague">I could just show him the two examples of the portrait of his wife, which pleased
        him.</work></p>
    <p><bad_health>From what people tell me I’m very obviously looking better; on the inside my heart is a
        little too full of so many diverse emotions and hopes, for it astonishes me that I’m getting
        better.</bad_health></p>
    <p><unstress reason="friendship">Everyone here is good towards me, the neighbours &amp;c., good and attentive as in one’s
        native country.</unstress></p>
    <p>I know already that several people here would ask me for portraits if they dared ask for
        them. As Roulin, poor povertystricken devil and lowly employee as he is, is held in very,
        very great esteem here, people found out that I had done all his family.</p>
    <p>My dear brother, in times to come we may indeed fall into suffering again, into errors, into
        misfortune, I don’t deny it.</p>
    <p>But we’ll always have worked in this 89 here with the French we love so much, as on their
        side, too, they make us feel the fatherland. </p>
    <p> Now we have experienced that, at any rate.</p>
    <p>Don’t talk to your fiancée about this matter between us, leave me as I’ve asked you, to work
        until the last day of March. <work origin="new" stage="planned">And from now until then I’ll have done a few Impressionist
        canvases, come on.</work> <work origin="new" stage="middle">Today I started work on a third Berceuse. I do know that it’s neither
        drawn nor painted as correctly as a Bouguereau, which I almost regret, as I seriously have
        the desire to be correct — but although it isn’t therefore fated to be a Cabanel or a
        Bouguereau, I yet hope that it’s French.</work></p>
    <p><unstress reason="environment">The weather today has been magnificent with no wind, and I wanted so much to work that I’m
        astonished by it, as I hadn’t expected it any more.</unstress></p>
    <p><bad_health>I’ll end this letter like the one to Gauguin by telling you that there are indeed still signs
        of the previous overexcitement in my words, but that there’s nothing surprising about that,
        since in this good Tarascon country everyone is a touch cracked.</bad_health></p>
    <p>Good handshake, to De Haan and Isaäcson as well.</p></body>
    <close>Ever yours,</close>
    <sig>Vincent</sig>
    <ps><p>I’ll expect your letter as early as possible after 1 February.</p></ps>
