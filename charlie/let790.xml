      <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
      <body><p><stress reason="friendship">If I’m writing to you again today it’s because I’m enclosing a few words that I’ve written
            to our friend Gauguin, feeling sufficient calm return to me these last few days for my
            letter not to be absolutely absurd, it seemed to me. Besides, there’s no proof that by
            overrefining one’s scruples of respect or feeling one thereby gains respectfulness or
            good sense.</stress> <good_health>That being so, it does me good to talk with the pals again, even if at a
            distance.</good_health> And you – my dear fellow – how are things, and so write me a few words one of
            these days – for I can imagine that the emotions which must move the forthcoming father
            of a family, emotions of which our good father so loved to speak, must be great and of
            sterling worth in you, as in him, but for the moment are almost impossible for you to
            express in the rather incoherent mixture of the petty vexations of Paris. Realities of
            this sort must anyway be like a good gust of the mistral, not very soothing, but
            healthgiving. <good_health>As for me, it gives me very great pleasure I can assure you, and will
            contribute greatly to bringing me out of my moral fatigue and perhaps from my
            listlessness</good_health>. </p>
      <p><unstress reason="family">Anyway, there’s enough to bring back the taste for life a little when I think that I myself
            am going to be promoted uncle of this boy planned by your wife. I find it quite funny
            that she’s so convinced that it’s a boy, but anyway, we’ll see.</unstress></p>
      <p>Anyway, in the meantime I can do nothing but fiddle with my paintings a little. <work origin="new" stage="middle">I have one
            on the go of a moonrise over the same field as the croquis in the Gauguin letter, but in
            which stacks replace the wheat. It’s dull ochreyellow and violet.</work> Anyway, you’ll see in
            a while from now.</p>
      <p><work origin="new" stage="middle">I also have a new one with ivy on the go.</work> Above all, dear fellow, I beg of you, don’t fret
            or worry or be melancholy on my account, the idea that you would do so, certainly in
            this necessary and salutary quarantine, would have little justification when we need a
            slow and patient recovery. If we manage to grasp that, we spare our forces for this
            winter. <stress reason="environment">I imagine that winter must be quite dismal here, anyway will however have to try
            and occupy myself.</stress> <work origin="existing" stage="middle">I often imagine that I could retouch a lot of last year’s studies
            from Arles this winter.</work></p>
      <p><work origin="existing" stage="middle">Thus, having kept back these past few days a large study of an orchard which was very
            difficult (it’s the same orchard of which you’ll find a variation in the consignment,
            but quite a vague one), I’ve set to reworking it from memory, and have found a way
            better to express the harmony of the tones.</work> </p>
      <p><work mention="vague">Tell me, have you received any drawings from me? I sent you some once, by parcel post, half
            a dozen, and then later ten or so.</work> If by chance you haven’t received them, they must
            have been at the railway station for days and weeks.</p>
      <p>The doctor was telling me about Monticelli, that he had always considered him eccentric,
            but as for mad, he had only been a little that way towards the end. Considering all the
            miseries of M’s last years, is it any surprise that he bowed beneath a weight that was
            too heavy, and is one right in trying to deduce from that that he failed in his work,
            artistically speaking? I dare to believe not. There was some very logical calculation
            about him, and an originality as a painter, so it remains regrettable that one wasn’t
            able to sustain it so as to make its blossoming more complete.</p>
      <p><work origin="new" stage="finished">I enclose a croquis of the cicadas from here.</work></p>
      <p>Their song in times of great heat holds the same charm for me as the cricket in the
            peasant’s hearth at home. My dear fellow – let’s not forget that small emotions are the
            great captains of our lives, and that these we obey without knowing it. If it’s still
            hard for me to regain courage over faults committed and to be committed, which would be
            my recovery, let’s not forget from that moment on that neither our spleens and
            melancholies nor our feelings of good nature and good sense are our sole guides, and
            above all not our final custodians, and that if you yourself also find yourself facing
            hard responsibilities to venture, if not to take, my word let’s not be too concerned
            with each other, while it so happens that life’s circumstances in situations so far
            removed from our youthful conceptions of the life of the artist would render us brothers
            after all, as being companions in fate in many respects. Things are so closely connected
            that here one sometimes finds cockroaches in the food as if one were really in Paris, on
            the other hand it can happen in Paris that you sometimes have a real thought of the
            fields. It’s certainly not much, but it’s reassuring anyway. So take your fatherhood as
            a good fellow from our old heaths would take it, those heaths that remain ineffably dear
            to us through all the noise, tumult, fog, anguish of the towns, however timid our
            tenderness may be. That’s to say, take your fatherhood there, from your nature as an
            exile and a foreigner and a poor man, henceforth basing himself with the poor man’s
            instinct on the probability of the real existence of a native country, of a real
            existence at least of the memory, even while we’ve forgotten every day. Thus sooner or
            later we find our fate. But certainly for you, as well as for me, it would be a little
            hypocritical to forget completely our good humour, the confident sloppiness we had as
            the poor devils we were as we came and went in that Paris, so strange now – and to place
            too much weight upon our cares.</p>
      <p><good_health>Truly, I’m so pleased with the fact that if sometimes there are cockroaches in the food
            here, in your home there is wife and child.</good_health></p>
      <p>Besides, it’s reassuring that Voltaire, for example, left us free to believe not absolutely
            all of what we imagine. <stress reason="family">Thus while sharing your wife’s concerns about your health I’m
            not going so far as to believe what momentarily I was imagining, that worries about me
            were the cause of your relatively rather long silence in respect of me, although this is
            so well explained when one thinks of how preoccupying a pregnancy must necessarily be.</stress>
            But it’s very good and it’s the path where everyone walks in life. More soon, and good
            handshake to you and to Jo.</p></body>
      <close>Ever yours,</close>
      <sig>Vincent.</sig>
      <ps><p>In haste, but didn’t want to delay sending the letter for our friend Gauguin, you must have
            the address.</p></ps>
