      <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
      <body>
            <p>Thanks very much for your letter. First, it gives me very great pleasure that you,
                  for your part, had also already thought of père Pissarro.</p>
            <p> You’ll see that there are other possibilities, if not there then elsewhere. Now
                  business is business, and you ask me to answer categorically – and you’re right to
                  do so – if I would consent to go into an asylum in Paris in the event of moving
                  immediately for this winter.</p>
            <p>I answer yes to that, with the same calmness and for the same reasons as I entered
                  this one – even though this asylum in Paris might not be ideal, which might easily
                  be the case, for the opportunity to work isn’t bad here, and work my only
                  distraction.</p>
            <p>But that being said, I’ll point out to you that in my letter I gave a very serious
                  motive as a reason for wishing to move.</p>
            <p>And I insist on repeating it – I’m astonished that with the modern ideas I have, I
                  being such an ardent admirer of Zola, of De Goncourt and of artistic things which
                  I feel so much, I have crises like a superstitious person would have, and that
                  mixedup, atrocious religious ideas come to me such as I never had in my head in
                  the north.</p>
            <p><stress reason="environment">On the assumption that, very sensitive to surroundings, the already prolonged stay in
                  these old cloisters which are the Arles hospital and the home here would be
                  sufficient in itself to explain these crises – then – even as a stopgap – it might
                  be necessary to go into a lay asylum at present.</stress></p>
            <p>Nevertheless, to avoid doing or appearing to do anything rash, I declare to you,
                  after having thus warned you of what I might desire at a given moment – that is, a
                  move – I declare to you that I feel sufficiently calm and confident to wait </p>
            <p> a while longer to see if there’ll be a new attack this winter.</p>
            <p>But if then I was to write to you: I want to get out of here, you wouldn’t hesitate
                  and it would be arranged in advance, for you would know then that I’d have a
                  serious reason, or even several, to go into a home that wasn’t run like this one
                  by the nuns, however excellent they might be.</p>
            <p>Now if by some arrangement or another we might move sooner or later, then let’s begin
                  as if almost nothing was wrong, at the same time being very prudent and ready to
                  listen to the least thing that Rivet has to say, but let’s not set ourselves
                  immediately to taking overly official measures as if it were a lost cause.</p>
            <p>As regards eating a lot, I’m doing so – but if I was my doctor I would forbid it.</p>
            <p><unstress reason="career">Not seeing any good for myself in really enormous physical strength, for if I absorb
                  myself in the idea of doing some good work and wanting to be an artist and nothing
                  but that, that would be the most logical thing.</unstress></p>
            <p><unstress reason="family">Mother and Wil, each for their part after Cor’s departure, have changed surroundings
                  – they were darned right. Grief mustn’t build up in our souls like the water of a
                  swamp.</unstress> But it’s sometimes both costly and impossible to move.</p>
            <p>Wil wrote very well, it’s a great grief for them, Cor’s departure.</p>
            <p>It’s funny, just at the moment when I was making that copy of the Pietà by Delacroix
                  I discovered where that canvas has gone. It belongs to a queen of Hungary or
                  another country around there who has written poems under the name of Carmen Sylva.
                  The article which talked of her and of the painting was by Pierre Loti, who made
                  one feel that this Carmen Sylva was as a person yet more touching than what she
                  writes – and yet she </p>
            <p> writes things like this: A woman without a child is like a bell without a clapper –
                  the sound of the bronze would perhaps be very beautiful, but no one will hear
                  it.</p>
            <p><work mention="vague">At present I have 7 copies out of ten of Millet’s Travaux des champs.</work></p>
            <p>I can assure you that it interests me enormously to make copies, and that not having
                  any models for the moment it will ensure, however, that I don’t lose sight of the
                  figure.</p>
            <p>What’s more, it will give me a studio decoration for myself or another.</p>
            <p><work origin="new" stage="planned">I would like also to copy the Sower</work> and <work origin="new" stage="planned">the Diggers.</work></p>
            <p>There’s a photo of the Diggers after the drawing.</p>
            <p>And Lerat’s etching of the Sower at DurandRuel’s.</p>
            <p>In these same etchings is the Field under the snow with a harrow. Then The four times
                  of the day, there are examples of them in the collection of wood engravings.</p>
            <p>I would like to have all of this, at least the etchings and the wood engravings. It’s
                  a study I need, for I want to learn. Although copying may be the old system, that
                  absolutely doesn’t bother me at all. I’m going to copy Delacroix’s Good Samaritan
                  too.</p>
            <p><work origin="new" stage="finished">I’ve done a portrait of a woman – the orderly’s wife – which I think you’d like.</work> <work origin="existing" stage="finished">I’ve
                  done a repetition of it which wasn’t as good as the one from life.</work></p>
            <p>And I fear that they’ll take the latter, I would have liked you to have it. It’s pink
                  and black.</p>
            <p><work origin="new" stage="finished">Today I’m sending you my portrait of myself, you must look at it for some time –
                  you’ll see, I hope, that my physiognomy has grown much calmer, although the gaze
                  may be vaguer than before, so it appears to me.</work></p>
            <p>I have another one which is an attempt from when I was ill. But I think this one will
                  please you more, and I’ve tried to create something simple, show it to père
                  Pissarro if you see him.</p>
            <p> You’ll be surprised what effect the Travaux des champs take on in colour, it’s a
                  very intimate series of his.</p>
            <p>What I’m seeking in it, and why it seems good to me to copy them, I’m going to try to
                  tell you. We painters are always asked to compose ourselves and to be nothing but
                  composers.</p>
            <p>Very well – but in music it isn’t so – and if such a person plays some Beethoven
                  he’ll add his personal interpretation to it – in music, and then above all for
                  singing – a composer’s interpretation is something, and it isn’t a hard and fast
                  rule that only the composer plays his own compositions.</p>
            <p><good_health>Good – since I’m above all ill at present, I’m trying to do something to console
                  myself, for my own pleasure.</good_health></p>
            <p>I place the blackandwhite by Delacroix or Millet or after them in front of me as a
                  subject. And then I improvise colour on it but, being me, not completely of
                  course, but seeking memories of their paintings – but the memory, the vague
                  consonance of colours that are in the same sentiment, if not right – that’s my own
                  interpretation.</p>
            <p>Heaps of people don’t copy. Heaps of others do copy – for me, I set myself to it by
                  chance, and I find that it teaches and above all sometimes consoles.</p>
            <p>So then my brush goes between my fingers as if it were a bow on the violin and
                  absolutely for my pleasure. <work origin="new" stage="finished">Today I attempted the Sheep shearer in a colour scale
                  ranging from lilac to yellow. They are small canvases, around no. 5.</work></p>
            <p>I thank you very much for the consignment of canvases and colours. On the other hand,
                  I’m sending you a few canvases with the portrait, the following</p>
            <p><work origin="existing" stage="finished">Moonrise (wheatsheaves)</work></p>
            <p><work origin="existing" stage="finished">Study of fields</work></p>
            <p><work origin="existing" stage="finished">,, of olive trees</work></p>
            <p><work origin="existing" stage="finished">Night study</work></p>
            <p><work origin="existing" stage="finished">The mountain</work></p>
            <p><work origin="existing" stage="finished">Field of green wheat</work></p>
            <p><work origin="existing" stage="finished">Olive trees</work></p>
            <p><work origin="existing" stage="finished">Orchard in blossom</work></p>
            <p><work origin="existing" stage="finished">Entrance to a quarry</work></p>
            <p>The first four canvases are studies that don’t have the effect of an ensemble like
                  the others. Myself I quite like the Entrance to a quarry which I did when I felt
                  this attack beginning, because to my taste the dark greens go well with the ochre
                  tones, there’s something sad in them that’s healthy, and that’s why it doesn’t
                  annoy me. That’s perhaps also the case with the Mountain. People will tell me that
                  mountains aren’t like that, and that there are black contours as wide as a finger.
                  But anyway it seemed to me that it expressed the passage in Rod’s book – one of
                  the very rare passages of his in which I find something good – on a lost land of
                  dark mountains in which one noticed the darkish huts of goatherds, where
                  sunflowers bloomed.</p>
            <p>The olive trees with white cloud and background of mountains, as well as the Moonrise
                  and the Night effect –</p>
            <p>These are exaggerations from the point of view of the arrangement, their lines are
                  contorted like those of the ancient woodcuts. The olive trees are more in
                  character, just as in the other study and I’ve tried to express the time of day
                  when one sees the green beetles and the cicadas flying in the heat.</p>
            <p>The other canvases – the Reaper &amp;c. aren’t dry. And now in the bad season I’m
                  going to make a lot of copies, for really I must do more figure work. It’s the
                  study of the figure that teaches one to grasp the essential and to simplify.</p>
            <p>When you say in your letter that I’ve never done anything but work, no – that’s not
                  right – <stress reason="career">I myself am very, very discontented with my work, and the only thing that
                  consoles me is that experienced people say that one must paint for 10 years for
                  nothing.</stress> But what I’ve done is only those 10 years of unfortunate studies that
                  didn’t come off. Now a better period could come, but I’ll have to strengthen the
                  figure work, and I must refresh my memory by very close study of Delacroix,
                  Millet. Then I’ll try to sort out my drawing. Yes, every cloud has a silver
                  lining, it gives one more time for study.</p>
            <p><work mention="vague">I’m also adding a study of flowers to the roll of canvases – not much, but anyway I
                  don’t want to tear it up.</work></p>
            <p>All in all the only things I consider a little good in it are the Wheatfield, the
                  Mountain, the Orchard, the Olive trees with the blue hills and the Portrait and
                  the Entrance to the quarry, and the rest says nothing to me, because it lacks
                  personal will, feeling in the lines. Where these lines are close together and
                  deliberate the painting begins, even if it may be exaggerated. That’s what Bernard
                  and Gauguin feel a little bit, they won’t ask for the correct shape of a tree at
                  all, but they absolutely insist that one says if the shape is round or square –
                  and my word, they’re right –</p>
            <p>Exasperated by certain people’s photographic and inane perfection. They won’t ask for
                  the correct tone of the mountains but they’ll say: for Christ’s sake, were the
                  mountains blue, then chuck on some blue and don’t go telling me that it was a blue
                  a bit like this or like that, it was blue wasn’t it? Good – make them blue and
                  that’s enough! Gauguin is a genius sometimes when he explains that, but as for the
                  genius Gauguin has, he’s very timid about showing it, and it’s touching how he
                  likes to say something really useful to young folk. What an odd fellow all the
                  same.</p>
            <p>It gives me great pleasure that Jo is well, and I think you’ll feel much more in your
                  element thinking of her pregnancy, and naturally having concerns about it too,
                  than if you were alone without these family concerns. For you’ll feel more in
                  nature.</p>
            <p>When one thinks of Millet and Delacroix, what a contrast. Delacroix without a wife,
                  without children, Millet completely in his family, more than anyone.</p>
            <p>And yet what similarities there are in their work.</p>
            <p>So Jouve has still kept his big studio and he’s working on decorations.</p>
            <p><stress reason="friendship">That one came very close to being an excellent painter. It’s money troubles with him,
                  in order to eat he’s forced to do a thousand things other than painting, which
                  costs him more money than it brings in when he makes something beautiful.</stress></p>
            <p>And he quickly loses his touch for drawing with the brush. This probably comes from
                  the old training method, which is the same as the current one – in the studios –
                  they fill in outlines. And Daumier was always painting his face in the mirror to
                  learn how to draw!</p>
            <p>Do you know what I think about quite often – what I used to say to you back in the
                  old days, that if I didn’t succeed I still thought that what I had worked on would
                  be continued. Not directly, but one isn’t alone in believing things that are true.
                  And what does one matter as a person then? I feel so strongly that the story of
                  people is like the story of wheat, if one isn’t sown in the earth to germinate
                  there, what does it matter, one is milled in order to become bread.</p>
            <p>The difference between happiness and unhappiness, both are necessary and useful, and
                  death or passing away... it’s so relative – and so is life.</p>
            <p>Even in the face of an illness that’s unsettling or worrying, this belief is
                  absolutely unshaken.</p>
            <p>I’d have liked to see those Meuniers.</p>
            <p>Well, let it be understood that if I were to write to you again expressly and briefly
                  that I wanted to come to Paris, I would have a reason for that, which I’ve
                  explained above, that in the meantime there’s no great hurry, and I’m quite
                  confident, after warning you, to wait for the winter and the crisis which may
                  recur then. But if I have another fit of religious exaltation, then no delay, I’d
                  like to leave immediately without giving a reason. Only we have no right, at least
                  it would be indiscreet, to meddle in the nuns’ management or even to criticize
                  them. They have their own belief and ways of doing good to others, sometimes it
                  works very well. But I don’t warn you lightly. And it isn’t to regain more freedom
                  or something else that I don’t have. So let’s wait very calmly until an
                  opportunity presents itself to find a place.</p>
            <p>It’s a great advance that my stomach is working well, and so I don’t think that I’ll
                  be as sensitive to the cold. Then I know what to do when the weather is bad, as I
                  have this plan to copy several things that I like.</p>
            <p>I’d very much like to see Millet reproductions in schools, I think there would be
                  children who became painters if only they saw good things.</p>
            <p>Give my warm regards to Jo, and handshake, more soon. </p>
