      <head>5 and 6 September 1889</head><salutation>My dear brother,</salutation>
      <body>
            <p>Although I’ve already written to you, there are still many things you have told me
                  and to which I haven’t yet replied. <stress reason="money">First that you’ve
                        rented a room in Tanguy’s house and that my canvases are there, that’s most
                        interesting – provided you’re not paying a lot for it – the expenses still
                        continuing and the canvases still taking their time to bring anything back
                        in, that often frightens me.</stress></p>
            <p><unstress reason="family">Be that as it may, I think it’s a very good step, and I
                        thank you for it, as for so many other things.</unstress>
                  <stress reason="career">It’s curious that Maus has the idea of inviting young
                        Bernard and me for the next Vingtistes exhibition, I would really like to
                        exhibit there, while feeling my inferiority alongside so many Belgians who
                        have an enormous amount of talent.</stress> That Mellery, for instance, is a
                  great artist. And he’s also been holding up for a number of years now. <work
                        mention="vague">But I would do my best to try to do something good this
                        autumn. I’m working nonstop in my room,</work>
                  <good_health>which is doing me good and driving away, I imagine, these abnormal
                        ideas.</good_health></p>
            <p><work origin="existing" stage="finished">Thus I’ve redone the canvas of the
                        Bedroom.</work> That study is certainly one of the best – sooner or later it
                  will definitely have to be lined. It was painted so quickly and dried in such a
                  way that, as the thinner evaporated immediately, the painting doesn’t adhere at
                  all firmly to the canvas. This will also be the case with other studies of mine
                  that were painted very quickly and with a thick impasto. Besides, this thin canvas
                  perishes after a while and can’t take a lot of impasto.</p>
            <p>You’ve taken some excellent stretching frames, damn it, if I had some like that here
                  to work on that would be better than these strips of wood from here that warp in
                  the sun.</p>
            <p>People say – and I’m quite willing to believe it – that it’s difficult to know
                  oneself – but it’s not easy to paint oneself either. Thus I’m working on two
                  portraits of myself at the moment – for want of another model – </p>
            <p> because it’s more than time that I did a bit of figure work. <work origin="existing"
                        stage="middle">One I began the first day I got up, I was thin, pale as a
                        devil. It’s dark violet blue and the head whiteish with yellow hair, thus a
                        colour effect.</work></p>
            <p><work origin="new" stage="middle">But since then I’ve started another one,
                        threequarter length on a light background.</work></p>
            <p><work origin="existing" stage="middle">Then I’m retouching some studies from this
                        summer – anyway I’m working from morning till night.</work></p>
            <p><stress reason="family">Are you well – darn it, I really wish for you that you were 2
                        years further on, and that these early days of marriage, however beautiful
                        they may be at times, were behind you. I believe so firmly that a marriage
                        becomes good above all in the long run, and that then one recovers one’s
                        temperament. So take things with a certain northern phlegm and take care of
                        yourselves, both of you.</stress>
                  <bad_health>This bloody life in the fine arts is exhausting, so it
                        seems.</bad_health></p>
            <p><good_health>Strength is coming back to me day by day, and once again it seems to me
                        that I already have almost too much of it. For to remain hardworking at the
                        easel it isn’t necessary to be a Hercules.</good_health></p>
            <p>What you told me about Maus having been to see my canvases has made me think a lot
                  about Belgian painters lately and during my illness. Then memories come to me like
                  an avalanche, and I try to rebuild for myself that whole school of modern Flemish
                  artists to the point of being as homesick as a Swiss.</p>
            <p>Which isn’t good, for our path is – onward – and retracing one’s steps is forbidden
                  and impossible. That’s to say that one could think about it without getting lost
                  in the past through an overmelancholy nostalgia.</p>
            <p>Anyway, Henri Conscience isn’t a perfect writer at all, but here and there, more or
                  less everywhere, what a painter! And what kindness in what he said and wished for.
                  All the time I have a preface in my head – (the one to Le conscrit) to one of his
                  books in which he says that he’d been very ill and that in his illness, despite
                  all his efforts, he had felt his affection for mankind withering away, and that
                  long walks out in the open fields brought his feelings of love back to him.</p>
            <p>This inevitability of suffering and despair – anyway, here I am again, recovered for
                  a period – I’m thankful for it.</p>
            <p>I’m writing you this letter bit by bit in intervals when I’m tired of painting. Work
                  is going quite well – <work origin="existing" stage="middle">I’m struggling with a
                        canvas begun a few days before my indisposition. A reaper, the study is all
                        yellow, terribly thickly impasted, but the subject was beautiful and
                        simple.</work> I then saw in this reaper – a vague figure struggling like a
                  devil in the full heat of the day to reach the end of his toil – I then saw the
                  image of death in it, in this sense that humanity would be the wheat being reaped.
                  So if you like it’s the opposite of that Sower I tried before. But in this death
                  nothing sad, it takes place in broad daylight with a sun that floods everything
                  with a light of fine gold. Good, here I am again, however I’m not letting go, and
                  I’m trying again on a new canvas. <good_health>Ah, I could almost believe that I
                        have a new period of clarity ahead of me.</good_health></p>
            <p>And what should I do – continue here for these months, or move – I don’t know.
                        <bad_health>The thing is, when the crises present themselves they aren’t
                        amusing, and to risk having an attack like that with you or others is
                        serious.</bad_health></p>
            <p><work mention="vague">My dear brother – I’m still writing to you between bouts of
                        work – I’m ploughing on like a man possessed, more than ever I have a pentup
                        fury for work,</work>
                  <good_health>and I think that this will contribute to curing me.</good_health></p>
            <p><bad_health>Perhaps something will happen to me like the thing E. Delacroix speaks of
                        – “I found painting when I had neither teeth nor breath left”, in this sense
                        that my sad illness makes me work with a pentup fury – very slowly – but
                        from morning till night without respite – and – this is probably the secret
                        – work for a long time and slowly.</bad_health> What do I know about it, but
                  I think that I have one or two canvases on the go that aren’t too bad, first the
                  reaper in the yellow wheat, and the portrait on a light background.<stress
                        reason="career"> This will be for the Vingtistes, if indeed they remember me
                        when the time comes. Now, it would be absolutely the same to me, if not
                        preferable, if they forget me.</stress></p>
            <p>Since I myself don’t forget the inspiration that I gain from giving free rein to my
                  memories of certain Belgians. That’s the positive thing, and the rest is so
                  secondary.</p>
            <p>And here we are in September already, we’ll soon be in the middle of autumn, and then
                  winter.</p>
            <p><bad_health>I’ll carry on working very hard, and then if the crisis returns towards
                        Christmas we’ll see, and once that’s over then I wouldn’t see any
                        disadvantage in sending the management here to all the devils and coming
                        back to the north for a fairly long time. Leaving now would perhaps be too
                        unwise, when I consider a new crisis likely in the winter, i.e. in 3
                        months.</bad_health></p>
            <p><stress reason="environment">I haven’t set a foot outside for 6 weeks, not even in
                        the garden.</stress></p>
            <p>I’ll try, though, next week, when I’ve finished the canvases in progress.</p>
            <p>But another few months and I’ll be so flabby and stupefied that a change will
                  probably do a lot of good.</p>
            <p>That, for the moment, is my idea on the subject, of course it isn’t a fixed idea.</p>
            <p><stress reason="friendship">But am of the opinion that we shouldn’t put ourselves out
                        any more with the people of this establishment than with the owners of a
                        hotel. We’ve rented a room from them for a certain amount of time, and
                        they’re well paid for what they give, and that’s absolutely all.</stress>
            </p>
            <p>Not to mention the fact that perhaps they’d like nothing better than for the
                  situation to be chronic, and one would be culpably stupid if one gave in to them
                  on that.</p>
            <p><stress reason="money">For my taste, they make far too many enquiries about not only
                        what I but you earn &amp;c.</stress></p>
            <p>So let’s give them the slip. Without quarrelling.</p>
            <p>I’m still continuing this letter between times. <work origin="new" stage="middle"
                        >Yesterday I began the portrait of the chief orderly,</work>
                  <work origin="new" stage="planned">and perhaps I’ll also do his wife, for he’s
                        married and lives in a little farmhouse a stone’s throw from the
                        establishment.</work></p>
            <p>A most interesting figure. There’s a beautiful etching by Legros of an old Spanish
                  nobleman, if you remember it that will give you an idea of the type. He was at the
                  hospital in Marseille during 2 episodes of cholera, anyway he’s a man who has seen
                  an enormous number of people die and suffer, and there’s an indefinable
                  contemplation in his face, such that I can’t help recalling the face of Guizot –
                  for there’s something of that one in this head – but different. But he’s a man of
                  the people, and simpler. Anyway, you’ll see it if I succeed in it and if I do a
                  repetition of it.</p>
            <p><bad_health>I’m struggling with all my energy to master my work, telling myself that
                        if I win this it will be the best lightning conductor for the
                        illness.</bad_health>
                  <stress reason="friendship">I take great care of myself by carefully shutting
                        myself away; it’s selfish if you like, not to become accustomed to my
                        companions in misfortune here instead, and to go to see them,</stress>
                  <stress reason="career">but anyway I feel none the worse for it, for my work is
                        progressing and we have need of that, for it’s more than necessary that I do
                        better than before, which wasn’t sufficient.</stress></p>
            <p>Isn’t it better that if I were to come back from here again, sooner or later, I come
                  back decidedly capable of doing a portrait that has some character, than to come
                  back as I left? It’s coarsely expressed, for I really feel that one can’t say ‘I
                  can do a portrait’ without telling a lie, because that is infinite. But anyway
                  you’ll understand what I want to say, that I must do better than before.</p>
            <p><good_health>At the moment my mind is functioning regularly and I feel absolutely
                        normal – and if I think rationally at present about my condition with the
                        hope of having in general between the crises</good_health> – if,
                  unfortunately, it’s to be feared that this will always recur from time to time –
                  of having periods of clarity and work between times – if I think rationally </p>
            <p> at present about my condition then certainly I tell myself that I mustn’t have the
                  idée fixe of being ill. But that I must continue my little career as a painter
                  firmly. To remain for good in an asylum from now on would probably be exaggerating
                  things.</p>
            <p>I was reading in Le Figaro a few days ago a story of a Russian writer who lived with
                  a nervous illness from which he, moreover, sadly died, which caused him terrible
                  attacks from time to time.</p>
            <p><bad_health>And what can one do, there’s no remedy, or if there is it’s to work
                        passionately. I dwell on that more than I should. And all in all I prefer to
                        have a proper illness like this than to be as I was in Paris when it was
                        brewing.</bad_health></p>
            <p><work origin="existing" stage="finished">Also you’ll see this when you put the
                        portrait with the light background which I’ve just finished beside those I
                        did of myself in Paris, that at present I look healthier than then, and even
                        a great deal more so.</work>
            </p>
            <p>I’m even inclined to believe that the portrait will tell you better than my letter
                  how I am, and that it will reassure you – it cost me some trouble.</p>
            <p>And then the reaper is working too I think – it’s very, very simple.</p>
            <p><work mention="vague">At the end of the month you can rely on 12 no. 30 canvases I
                        dare say, but there will be almost the same ones twice, the study and the
                        final painting.</work></p>
            <p><unstress reason="environment">Anyway later – perhaps my journey into the south will
                        bear fruit however, because the difference of the stronger light, the blue
                        sky, that teaches one to see, and then above all and even only when one sees
                        that for a long time.</unstress></p>
            <p>The north will certainly appear completely new to me, but I’ve looked so much at the
                  things that I’ve become strongly attached to them, and </p>
            <p>
                  <bad_health>I’ll remain melancholy for a long time.</bad_health></p>
            <p>I’m thinking of a funny thing. Modern art is discussed in Manette Salomon, and some
                  artist or other speaking of ‘what will remain’ says: what will remain are ‘the
                  landscape artists’ – that had a grain of truth, because Corot, Daubigny, Dupré,
                  Rousseau – Millet as a landscape painter, that lasts, and when Corot says on his
                  deathbed: in a dream I saw landscapes with completely pink skies, it was charming;
                  then – very good – in Monet, Pissarro, Renoir we see those completely pink skies,
                  so the landscape painters do last well, that was darned true. Let’s leave aside
                  the figure painting of Delacroix, of Millet.</p>
            <p>Afterwards, what are we beginning to glimpse timidly at the moment that is original
                  and lasting – the portrait. That’s something old, one might say – but it’s also
                  brand new. We’ll talk more about this – but let’s still continue to seek out
                  portraits, above all of artists, like the Guillaumin and Guillaumin’s portrait of
                  a young girl, and take good care of my portrait by Russell, which means a lot to
                  me.</p>
            <p>Have you framed the Laval portrait, you haven’t told me what you thought of it I
                  think, I found it marvellous, that gaze through the pincenez, such an honest
                  gaze.</p>
            <p>The will that I have to do portraits these days is terribly strong, anyway Gauguin
                  and I used to chat about that and about similar questions in such a way as to
                  stretch our nerves to the extinction of all vital warmth.</p>
            <p>But out of that, however, a few good paintings must emerge I dare think, and we’re
                  seeking them and they must, I imagine, be doing good work in Brittany. <unstress
                        reason="friendship">I’ve received a letter from G., I think I’ve already
                        told you, and I’m very curious to see what they’re doing one
                  day.</unstress></p>
            <p>I must ask you for the following painting items. 10 metres canvas</p>
            <p>Large tubes 6 tubes zinc white</p>
            <p>,, ,, 2 ,, emerald green</p>
            <p>2 ,, cobalt</p>
            <p>Small tubes</p>
            <p> 2 Carmine</p>
            <p> 1 vermilion</p>
            <p>1 Large tube crimson lake</p>
            <p>6 fitch brushes, black hair.</p>
            <p>Then I’ve promised the orderly here an issue of Le Monde Illustré, Issue 1684, 6 July
                  1889, in which there’s a very pretty engraving after DemontBreton.</p>
            <p><work origin="existing" stage="finished">Phew – the reaper is finished, I think it
                        will be one that you’ll place in your home – it’s an image of death as the
                        great book of nature speaks to us about it – but what I sought is the
                        ‘almost smiling’. It’s all yellow except for a line of violet hills – a
                        pale, blond yellow.</work> I myself find that funny, that I saw it like that
                  through the iron bars of a cell.</p>
            <p>Ah well, do you know what I hope for once I set myself to having some hope, it’s that
                  the family will be for you what nature is for me, the mounds of earth, the grass,
                  the yellow wheat, the peasant. That’s to say that you find in your love for people
                  the wherewithal not only to work but the wherewithal to console you and restore
                  you when one needs it. <stress reason="family">So please don’t let yourself be
                        exhausted too much by business matters but take good care of yourselves,
                        both of you – perhaps in a nottoodistant future there’s still some
                        good.</stress></p>
            <p><work origin="new" stage="planned">I really want to redo the reaper one more time for
                        Mother, if not I’ll make her another painting for her birthday, that will
                        come later, for I’ll send it with the rest.</work></p>
            <p>For I’m sure that Mother would understand it – for it’s indeed as simple as one of
                  those coarse wood engravings that one finds in country almanacs.</p>
            <p><work origin="existing" stage="planned">Send me the canvas as soon as you can, because I
                        want to do some more repetitions for the sisters too, and if I undertake new
                        autumnal effects I’ll have the wherewithal to fill my time from one end to
                        the other for this month.</work></p>
            <p>I’m eating and drinking like a wolf at present. I must say that the doctor is very
                  kindly towards me.</p>
            <p>Yes, I think it’s a good idea to go and make a few paintings for Holland, for Mother
                  and the two sisters that will make three, i.e. <work stage="planned" origin="existing"
                        >the reaper,</work>
                  <work origin="existing" stage="planned">the bedroom,</work>
                  <work origin="existing" stage="planned">the olive trees,</work>
                  <work origin="existing" stage="planned">wheatfield and cypress,</work> that will make
                  four even, for then I have yet another person for whom I’ll make one too. I’ll
                  work on that with as much pleasure and more calm than for the Vingtistes, that
                  goes without saying, since I’m feeling strong you can be sure that I’m going to
                  try to get through a lot of work. I’m taking the best there are from 12 subjects,
                  so they’ll still have things that are a little studied and chosen. And then there
                  is good in working for people who don’t know what a painting is.</p>
            <p>Good handshake to you and Jo.</p>
      </body>
      <close>Ever yours,</close>
      <sig>Vincent</sig>
      <ps>
            <p> I’m opening this letter once more to tell you that I’ve just seen Mr Peyron, I
                  hadn’t seen him for 6 days. He tells me that he’s planning to go to Paris this
                  month and that he’ll see you then. That gives me pleasure, for he has, there’s no
                  doubt about it, a lot of experience, and I think he’ll tell you what he thinks of
                  it quite frankly.</p>
            <p><bad_health>To me he only said – ‘let’s hope that it won’t recur’, but anyway I’m
                        counting on it recurring for quite a long time, for a few years at
                        least.</bad_health>
                  <good_health>But I’m also counting on the fact that work, far from being
                        impossible for me, can go along steadily in the meantime, and is even my
                        remedy.</good_health> And so I say once more – excluding Mr Peyron the
                  doctor absolutely – that as regards the management here we should probably be
                  polite, but that we should limit ourselves to that but bind ourselves to
                  nothing.</p>
            <p>It’s very serious that wherever I were to stay here for a little longer I would
                  perhaps come up against popular prejudices – I don’t even know what these
                  prejudices are – which would make my life with them unbearable.</p>
            <p>But anyway, I’m awaiting what Mr Peyron will say to you, myself I have no idea what
                  his opinion is. <work origin="existing" stage="middle">I worked this afternoon on
                        the portrait of the orderly, which is progressing.</work> If it weren’t very
                  much tempered – completely – by an intelligent gaze and an expression of kindness
                  – he would be a real bird of prey. He really is a southern type.</p>
            <p>I’m curious if Mr Peyron’s planned journey will indeed take place this time, I’m very
                  curious to know what may come of it.</p>
            <p><unstress reason="career">With another year’s work, perhaps I’ll arrive at a feeling
                        of selfsecurity from the artistic point of view. And that’s always something
                        worth seeking.</unstress></p>
            <p>But for that I must have good luck. What I dream of in my best moments aren’t so much
                  dazzling colour effects as the halftones once again.</p>
            <p>And certainly the visit to the Montpellier museum contributed to turning my thoughts
                  in that direction. For what touched me there more than the magnificent Courbets,
                  which are marvels, the young ladies of the village, the sleeping spinner – were
                  the portraits of Bruyas by Delacroix and by Ricard, then the Daniel, Delacroix’s
                  odalisques, all in halftones. For these odalisques are something quite different
                  from those in the Louvre. It’s above all purplish.</p>
            <p>But in these halftones what choice and what quality!</p>
            <p>It’s time for me to send off this letter at last – I could tell you in two pages what
                  it contains, i.e. nothing new. But anyway, I don’t have time to redo it.</p>
            <p><stress reason="money">Good handshake once again, and if it doesn’t put you out too
                        much let me have the canvas as soon as possible.</stress></p>
            <p>Ever yours,</p>
            <p>V.</p>
