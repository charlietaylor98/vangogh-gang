        <p>When the Lord’s Supper is next celebrated here I’ll attend it, you should do the same in
            The Hague, let us go as true participants in the Lord’s Supper.</p>
        <p>And take this piece of rye bread too, and eat it, as I do, with our thoughts turned
            toward our Father’s house and to the things we heard and saw there.</p>
        <p>And believe me</p>
    </body>
    <close>Your most loving and affectionate brother</close>
    <sig>Vincent</sig>
    <ps>
        <p>And pray: Lord, bless this food!</p>
        <p>Herewith Ecce Homo, send me Mater Dolorosa. Adieu, old boy, a handshake in thought.</p>
