    <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
    <body>
        <p>I sincerely wish you the best in the new year, I wish you well and may you be blessed in
            all things. Wonderful to have seen each other again, how beautiful it was that morning
            you left, and how often we’ll think back on that trip to Chaam.</p>
        <p><stress reason="family">Ma’s eye is hurting a lot again, she has a bandage on;</stress> Pa delivered such a beautiful
            sermon again this morning.</p>
        <p><stress reason="family">And now this evening New Year’s Eve again, if only you were here.</stress></p>
        <p>Now then, there’s something I must tell you: a couple of days ago Mr Braat of Dordrecht
            paid a visit to Uncle Vincent and they spoke about me, and Uncle asked Mr B. whether he
            would have a place for me, if I should wish it. Mr B. thought he might have a place, and
            said that I should come sometime to talk about it. So I went there early yesterday
            morning; Pa and Ma and I, too, thought it was something we shouldn’t let pass without
            seeing what it was.</p>
        <p>Agreed that after the New Year I should go to him for a week, after that we’ll see.</p>
        <p><unstress reason="career">There are many things that make it desirable, first and foremost my being back in Holland
            near Pa and Ma, and also you and the others. Moreover, the salary would certainly be a
            little better than with Mr Jones, and especially with an eye to later, when a man has
            need of more, one is obliged to think of such things.</unstress></p>
        <p><good_health>As far as the other thing is concerned, for these reasons I won’t give it up. Pa’s spirit
            is so great and manysided, and at all events I hope that something of it will develop in
            me.</good_health> The change means that now, instead of teaching those boys, I’ll be working in a
            bookshop.</p>
        <p><stress reason="family">How often we’ve longed to be together, and how terrible it is to feel so far away from
            one another in cases of illness or anxiety, as we felt, for example, during your
            illness, and then the feeling that lack of money may very well stand in the way of our
            being together in times of need.</stress></p>
        <p>It’s quite possible, then, that I’ll go there.</p>
        <p>Yesterday evening I was at Uncle Vincent’s to tell him that I’d just been to Dordrecht,
            <unstress reason="environment">it was a stormy evening, you can imagine how beautiful the road to Princenhage was with
            the dark clouds with their silver linings. I also went briefly to the Roman Catholic
            church, where evening Mass was under way, it was a beautiful sight, all those peasants
            and their wives with their black clothes and white caps, and the church looked so
            friendly in the evening light.</unstress> You must also tell Mr Tersteeg straightaway that I’ll be
            going there for a week to see how it goes, let His Hon. read this letter, if you will,
            and be sure to give him and his wife my best wishes for a happy New Year. I’m writing in
            great haste, Anna and the girls and Cor went to Princenhage, and Pa wanted me to go with
            them. Aunt came back with them in the carriage and I went for a walk with Willem
            Carbentus. Now, old boy, dear brother, what good days those were when we were all
            together, have a good New Year’s Eve and believe me</p>
    </body>
    <close>Your loving brother</close>

    <ps>
        <p>More soon – adieu. If you write, send your letter to Dordrecht.</p>
