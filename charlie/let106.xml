  <head>8 March 1877. God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with
    the temptation also make a way to escape.Let none of these things move thee.</head>
  <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
  <body>
    <p>Thanks for your letter, be of good heart, and He shall strengthen thine heart. Today I
      received a long letter from home in which Pa asked me if it would suit us both to go to
      Amsterdam next Sunday to visit Uncle Cor. If it’s all right with you, then I’ll come to you in
      The Hague on Saturday evening on the train that arrives a few minutes after 11, and in the
      morning we’ll take the first train to Amsterdam and stay till evening.</p>
    <p><unstress reason="family">We ought to do it, Pa seems very keen on the idea, then we’ll be together again next Sunday.
      It is possible, isn’t it, for me to stay with you that night?</unstress> Otherwise I’ll go to the
      Toelast. Write a postcard now if you agree, let us stick close together.</p>
    <p>Herewith a few words for Uncle Cor, add something to it if you like. It’s already late, <unstress reason="environment">this
      afternoon I took a walk, because I felt such a need to, first around the Grote Kerk, then the
      Nieuwe Kerk, and then up onto the dyke where all those mills are that one sees in the distance
      if one walks along the railway tracks. There is so much in that singular landscape and
      vicinity that speaks and seems to say ‘be of good courage, fear not’.</unstress></p>
    <p>There are days in one’s life when all members suffer because one member suffers, and where
      there is true ‘godly sorrow,’ God is not far, He who will hold us. If we believe that, let us,
      in those days, fervently desire and ask for things we should like to see happen, that we might
      also be heard. <stress reason="career">Would you also ask for me that a way be found for me to devote my life, more so
      than is now the case, to the service of Him and the gospel? I continue to insist and I believe
      that I’ll be heard, I say this in all humility and bowing myself down, as it were. It is such
      an import and such a difficult matter, and yet I desire it.</stress> One might say it isn’t humanly
      possible, but if I think about it more seriously and delve beneath the surface of what is
      humanly impossible, then truly my soul waiteth upon God, for it is possible for Him who
      speaks, and it is done, who commands, and it stands, and it stands fast. <bad_health>O Theo, Theo, old
      boy, if only it might happen to me and that deluge of downcastness about everything which I
      undertook and failed at, that torrent of reproaches I’ve heard and felt, if it might be taken
      away from me and if I might be given the opportunity and the strength and the love required to
      develop and to persevere and to stand firm in that for which my Father and I would offer the
      Lord such heartfelt thanks.</bad_health> A handshake in thought and regards to everyone at the Rooses’, ask
      it for me in this thy day, and believe me</p>
