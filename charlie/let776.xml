      <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
      <body>
            <p>Your letter which I’ve just received gives me great pleasure. You tell me that J.H.
                  Weissenbruch has two paintings in the exhibition — but I thought he was dead — am
                  I mistaken? He certainly is one hell of an artist and a good man, with a big heart
                  too.</p>
            <p>What you say about the Berceuse gives me pleasure; it’s very true that the common
                  people, who buy themselves chromos and listen with sentimentality to barrel
                  organs, are vaguely in the right and perhaps more sincere than certain
                  menabouttown who go to the Salon.</p>
            <p><work mention="vague">Gauguin, if he’ll accept it, you shall give him a version of the Berceuse that wasn’t
                  mounted on a stretching frame, and to Bernard too, as a token of friendship.</work></p>
            <p><work mention="vague">But if Gauguin wants sunflowers it’s only absolutely fair that he gives you something
                  that you like as much in exchange. Gauguin himself above all liked the sunflowers
                  later, when he had seen them for a long time.</work></p>
            <p>You must know, too, that if you put them in this order:</p>
            <p><work mention="vague">that is, the Berceuse in the middle and the two canvases of the sunflowers to the
                  right and the left, this forms a sort of triptych. And then the yellow and orange
                  tones of the head take on more brilliance through the proximity of the yellow
                  shutters. And then you will understand that what I was writing to you about it,
                  that my idea had been to make a decoration like one for the far end of a cabin on
                  a ship, for example. Then as the size gets bigger, the summary execution gets its
                  raison d’être. The middle frame is then the red one. And the two sunflowers that
                  go with it are those surrounded by strips of wood.</work></p>
            <p>You see that this framing of simple laths does quite well, and a frame like that
                  costs only very little. It would be perhaps good to frame the green and red
                  vineyards, the sower and the furrows and the interior of the bedroom with them
                  too. </p>
            <p><work origin="new" stage="middle">Here’s a new no. 30 canvas, commonplace again, like one of those chromos from a penny
                  bazaar that depict eternal nests of greenery for lovers.</work></p>
            <p>Thick treetrunks covered with ivy, the ground also covered with ivy and periwinkle, a
                  stone bench and a bush of roses, blanched in the cold shadow. In the foreground a
                  few plants with white calyxes. It’s green, violet and pink.</p>
            <p>It’s just a question — which is unfortunately lacking in chromos from a penny bazaar
                  and barrel organs — of putting in some style.</p>
            <p><unstress reason="environment">Since I’ve been here, the neglected garden planted with tall pines under which grows
                  tall and badly tended grass intermingled with various weeds, has provided me with
                  enough work, and I haven’t yet gone outside.</unstress></p>
            <p><unstress reason="environment">However, the landscape of StRémy is very beautiful, and little by little I’m probably
                  going to make trips into it.</unstress> <unstress reason="career">But staying here as I am, the doctor has naturally
                  been in a better position to see what was wrong, and will, I dare hope, be more
                  reassured that he can let me paint.</unstress></p>
            <p><good_health>I assure you that I’m very well here, and that for the time being I see no reason at
                  all to come and board in Paris or its surroundings.</good_health> <unstress reason="environment">I have a little room with
                  greygreen paper with two watergreen curtains with designs of very pale roses
                  enlivened with thin lines of bloodred. These curtains, probably the leftovers of a
                  ruined, deceased rich man, are very pretty in design. Probably from the same
                  source comes a very worn armchair covered with a tapestry flecked in the manner of
                  a Diaz or a Monticelli, redbrown, pink, creamy white, black, forgetmenot blue and
                  bottle green.</unstress></p>
            <p><unstress reason="environment">Through the ironbarred window I can make out a square of wheat in an enclosure, a
                  perspective in the manner of Van Goyen, above which in the morning I see the sun
                  rise in its glory.</unstress> </p>
            <p><unstress reason="career">With this — as there are more than 30 empty rooms — I have another room in which to
                  work.</unstress></p>
            <p>The food is soso. It smells naturally a little musty, as in a cockroachridden
                  restaurant in Paris or a boarding school. As these unfortunates do absolutely
                  nothing (not a book, nothing to distract them but a game of boules and a game of
                  draughts) they have no other daily distraction than to stuff themselves with
                  chickpeas, haricot beans, lentils and other groceries and colonial foodstuffs by
                  the regulated quantities and at fixed times.</p>
            <p>As the digestion of these commodities presents certain difficulties, they thus fill
                  their days in a manner as inoffensive as it’s cheap. <good_health>But joking apart, the fear of
                  madness passes from me considerably</good_health> <bad_health>upon seeing from close at hand those who are
                  affected with it, as I may very easily be in the future.</bad_health></p>
            <p>Before I had some repulsion for these beings, and it was something distressing for me
                  to have to reflect that so many people of our profession, Troyon, Marchal, Meryon,
                  Jundt, M. Maris, Monticelli, a host of others, had ended up like that. I wasn’t
                  even able to picture them in the least in that state.</p>
            <p><good_health>Well, now I think of all this without fear, i.e. I find it no more atrocious than if
                  these people had snuffed it of something else, of consumption or syphilis, for
                  example.</good_health></p>
            <p>These artists, I see them take on their serene bearing again, and do you think it’s a
                  small thing to rediscover ancient members of the profession.</p>
            <p>Joking apart, that’s what I’m profoundly grateful for.</p>
            <p><unstress reason="friendship">For although there are some who howl or usually rave, here there is much true
                  friendship that they have for each other. They say, one must suffer others for the
                  others to suffer us, and other very true reasonings that they thus put into
                  practice. And between ourselves we understand each other very well, I can, for
                  example, chat sometimes with one who doesn’t reply except in incoherent sounds,
                  because he isn’t afraid of me. </unstress></p>
            <p>If someone has some crisis the others look after him, and intervene so that he
                  doesn’t harm himself.</p>
            <p>The same for those who have the mania of often getting angry. Old regulars of the
                  menagerie run up and separate the fighters, if there is a fight.</p>
            <p>It’s true that there are some who are in a more serious condition, whether they be
                  filthy, or dangerous. These are in another courtyard. Now I take a bath twice a
                  week, and stay in it for 2 hours, then my stomach is infinitely better than a year
                  ago, so I only have to continue, as far as I know. <unstress reason="money">I think I’ll spend less here
                  than elsewhere, since here I still have work on my plate, for nature is
                  beautiful.</unstress></p>
            <p><good_health>My hope would be that at the end of a year I’ll know better than now what I can do
                  and what I want. Then, little by little, an idea will come to me for beginning
                  again.</good_health> Coming back to Paris or anywhere at the moment doesn’t appeal to me at all,
                  I feel that I’m in the right place here. In my opinion, what most of those who
                  have been here for years are suffering from is an extreme sluggishness. Now, my
                  work will preserve me from that to a certain extent.</p>
            <p><unstress reason="environment">The room where we stay on rainy days is like a 3rdclass waiting room in some stagnant
                  village, all the more so since there are honourable madmen who always wear a hat,
                  spectacles and travelling clothes and carry a cane, almost like at the seaside,
                  and who represent the passengers there.</unstress></p>
            <p><work mention="vague">I’m obliged to ask you for some more colours, and especially some canvas. When I send
                  you the 4 canvases of the garden I have on the go you’ll see that, considering
                  that life happens above all in the garden, it isn’t so sad.</work> <work origin="new" stage="finished">Yesterday I drew a
                  very large, rather rare night moth there which is called the death’s head, its
                  coloration astonishingly distinguished: black, grey, white, shaded, and with
                  glints of carmine or vaguely tending towards olive green; it’s very big.</work></p>
            <p> To paint it I would have had to kill it, and that would have been a shame since the
                  animal was so beautiful. <work mention="vague">I’ll send you the drawing of it with a few other drawings
                  of plants.</work></p>
            <p>You could take the canvases which are dry enough at Tanguy’s or at your place off the
                  stretching frames and then put the new ones you consider worthy of it onto these
                  stretching frames. Gauguin must be able to give you the address of a liner for the
                  Bedroom who won’t be expensive.<stress reason="money"> This I imagine must be a 5franc restoration, if
                  it’s more then don’t have it done, I don’t think that Gauguin paid more when he
                  quite often had canvases of his own, Cézanne or Pissarro lined.</stress></p>
            <p> <good_health>Speaking of my condition, I’m still so grateful for yet another thing. I observe in
                  others that, like me, they too have heard sounds and strange voices during their
                  crises, that things also appeared to change before their eyes. And that softens
                  the horror that I retained at first of the crisis I had, and which when it comes
                  to you unexpectedly, cannot but frighten you beyond measure. Once one knows that
                  it’s part of the illness one takes it like other things. Had I not seen other mad
                  people at close hand I wouldn’t have been able to rid myself of thinking about it
                  all the time. For the sufferings of anguish aren’t funny when you’re caught in a
                  crisis.</good_health> Most epileptics bite their tongues and injure them. Rey told me that he
                  had known a case where someone had injured his ear as I did, and I believe I’ve
                  heard a doctor here who came to see me with the director say that he too had seen
                  it before. <good_health>I dare to believe that once one knows what it is, once one is aware of
                  one’s state and of possibly being subject to crises, that then one can do
                  something about it oneself so as not to be caught so much unawares by the anguish
                  or the terror.</good_health> Now, this has been diminishing for 5 months, I have good hope of
                  getting over it, or at least of not having crises of such force. There’s one
                  person here who has been shouting and always talking, like me, for a fortnight, he
                  thinks he hears voices and words in the echo of the corridors, probably because
                  the auditory nerve is sick and too sensitive, and with me it was both the sight
                  and the hearing at the same time which, according to what Rey said one day, is
                  usual at the beginning of epilepsy.</p>
            <p>Now the shock had been such that it disgusted me even to move, and nothing would have
                  been so agreeable to me as never to wake up again. <good_health>At present this horror of life
                  is already less pronounced, and the melancholy less acute.</good_health> <bad_health>But I still have
                  absolutely no will, hardly any desires or none, and everything that has to do with
                  ordinary life, the desire for example to see friends again, about whom I think
                  however, almost nil. That’s why I’m not yet at the point where I ought to leave
                  here soon, I would still have melancholy for everything. And it’s even only in
                  these very last days that the repulsion for life has changed quite radically.
                  There’s still a way to go from there to will and action.</bad_health></p>
            <p>It’s a shame that you yourself are still condemned to Paris, and that you never see
                  the countryside other than that around Paris.</p>
            <p>I think that it’s no more unfortunate for me to be in the company where I am than for
                  you always the fateful things at Goupil &amp; Cie. From that point of view we’re
                  quite equal. For only in part can you act in accordance with your ideas. Since,
                  however, we have once got used to these inconveniences, it becomes second
                  nature.</p>
            <p><stress reason="money">I think that although the paintings cost canvas, paint &amp;c., at the end of the
                  month, however, it’s more advantageous to spend a little more thus, and to make
                  them with what I’ve learned in total, than to abandon them while one would have to
                  pay for board and lodging all the same anyway.</stress> <work mention="vague">And that’s why I’m making them. So
                  this month I have 4 no. 30 canvases and two or three drawings.</work></p>
            <p><stress reason="money">But no matter what one does, the question of money is always there like the enemy
                  before the troops, and one can’t deny it or forget it.</stress> </p>
            <p>I retain my duties in that respect as much as anyone. And perhaps some day I’ll be in
                  a position to repay all that I’ve spent, because I consider that what I’ve spent
                  is, if not taken from you at least taken from the family, so consequently I’ve
                  produced paintings and I’ll do more. That is to act as you too act yourself. If I
                  had private means, perhaps my mind would be freer to do art for art’s sake, now I
                  content myself with believing that in working assiduously even so, without
                  thinking of it one perhaps makes some progress.</p>
            <p>Here are the colours I would need</p>
            <p> 3 emerald green</p>
            <p> 2 cobalt</p>
            <p> 1 ultramarine</p>
            <p> 1 orange lead</p>
            <p> 6 zinc white</p>
            <p> 5 metres canvas</p>
            <p> large tubes.</p>
            <p>Thanking you for your kind letter, I shake your hand warmly, as well as your
                  wife’s.</p>
      </body>
