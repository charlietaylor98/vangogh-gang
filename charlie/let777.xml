      <head>Between 31 May and 6 June 1889</head>
      <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
      <body>
            <p><stress reason="money">I still have to ask you to send me a few ordinary brushes as soon as possible, of
                  more or less these sizes</stress></p>
            <p>Half a dozen of each please.</p>
            <p>I hope that you’re well and your wife too, and that you’ll enjoy a little of the good
                  weather. At least here we have splendid sunshine.</p>
            <p><good_health>As for me, my health is good, and as for the head it will, let’s hope, be a matter of
                  time and patience.</good_health></p>
            <p>The director had a few words with me to say that he’d received a letter from you, and
                  that he’d written to you. To me he says nothing and I ask nothing of him, which is
                  simplest. He’s a little gouty man — widowed a few years ago — who has very dark
                  spectacles. As the establishment is a little moribund, the man appears to take
                  only a rather halfhearted enjoyment in this profession, and besides there’s reason
                  enough for it.</p>
            <p>A new person has arrived who is so agitated that he breaks everything and shouts day
                  and night, he also tears the straitjackets and up to now he scarcely calms down,
                  although he’s in a bath all day long, he demolishes his bed and all the rest in
                  his room, overturns his food &amp;c. It’s very sad to see — but they have a lot of
                  patience here and will eventually get there, however. </p>
            <p><bad_health>New things become old so quickly — I think that if I came to Paris in the state of
                  mind I’m currently in, I wouldn’t make any distinction between a socalled dark
                  painting or a bright Impressionist painting, between a varnished painting in oils
                  and a matt picture done with thinned paint.</bad_health></p>
            <p>I mean by this that having reflected as time passed — I believe more than ever in the
                  eternal youth of the school of Delacroix, Millet, Rousseau, Dupré, Daubigny, just
                  as much as in the current one or even in artists to come. I scarcely believe that
                  Impressionism will ever do more than the Romantics, for example.</p>
            <p>It’s certainly a far cry between that and admiring people like Léon Glaize or
                  Perrault.</p>
            <p> <unstress reason="environment">This morning I saw the countryside from my window a long time before sunrise with
                  nothing but the morning star, which looked very big.</unstress> Daubigny and Rousseau did
                  that, though, with the expression of all the intimacy and all the great peace and
                  majesty that it has, adding to it a feeling so heartbreaking, so personal. These
                  emotions I do not detest.</p>
            <p><stress reason="career">I still have remorse, and enormously when I think of my work, so little in harmony
                  with what I’d have wished to do. I hope that in the long run it will make me do
                  better things, but we aren’t there yet.</stress></p>
            <p>I think that you would do well to wash the canvases that are quite quite dry with
                  water and a little spirits of wine to remove the oil and the thinner from the
                  impasto. The same for the night café and the green vineyard, and above all for the
                  landscape that was in the walnut frame. The night also (but that one has recent
                  retouchings which might run with the spirits of wine).</p>
            <p><unstress reason="environment">I’ve been here almost a whole month, not one single time have I had the slightest
                  desire to be elsewhere; just the will to work again is becoming a tiny bit
                  firmer.</unstress></p>
            <p>I don’t notice any very clear desire to be elsewhere in the others either, and this
                  may very well come from the fact that one feels too decidedly broken for life
                  outside.</p>
            <p>What I don’t really understand is their absolute idleness. But that’s the great
                  defect of the south, and its ruin. <unstress reason="environment">But what a beautiful land and what beautiful
                  blue and what a sun.</unstress> <stress reason="environment">And yet I’ve only seen the garden and what I can make out
                  through the window.</stress></p>
            <p>Have you read the new book by Guy de Maupassant, Fort comme la mort, what is its
                  subject? What I read last in this category was Zola’s Le rêve, I found the figure
                  of the woman, the embroiderer, very, very beautiful, and the description of the
                  embroidery all in gold. Precisely because it’s like a question of colour,
                  different yellows, whole and broken. But the figure of the man struck me as rather
                  lifeless, and the great cathedral also made me as melancholy as hell. Only that
                  lilac and dark blue repoussoir makes, if you will, the blonde figure stand out.
                  But anyway, there are already things by Lamartine like that.</p>
            <p><stress reason="career">I hope that you’ll destroy a heap of things that are too bad in the heap I sent, or
                  at least will only show the most passable ones.</stress></p>
            <p>As regards the exhibition of the Independents, it’s all the same to me, act as if I
                  wasn’t there at all. <work origin="existing" stage="finished">To not be indifferent and not exhibit something too mad,
                  perhaps the starry night and the landscape with yellow greenery which was in the
                  walnut frame.</work> Since these are two of contrary colours, </p>
            <p> and that might give others the idea of doing night effects better than I do.</p>
            <p>Anyway you must absolutely stop worrying with regard to me now. <work origin="new" stage="planned">When I receive the
                  new canvas and the colours I’ll go out a bit to see the countryside.</work></p>
            <p>Since it’s just the season when there are lots of flowers and thus colour effects, it
                  will perhaps be wise to send me another 5 metres of canvas in addition.</p>
            <p>For the flowers will be shortlived and will be replaced by the yellow wheatfields.
                  The latter, above all, I would like to capture better than in Arles. The mistral
                  (since there are a few mountains here) appears far less annoying than in Arles,
                  where you always get it at first hand.</p>
            <p>When you receive the canvases I’ve done in the garden you’ll see that I’m not too
                  melancholy here.</p>
            <p>More soon, good handshake in thought to you and to Jo.</p>
