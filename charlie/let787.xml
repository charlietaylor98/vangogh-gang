    <salutation>Dear brother and sister.</salutation>
    <body>
        <p><unstress reason="family">Jo’s letter tells me a very great piece of news this morning, I congratulate you on it,
            and am very pleased to hear it. </unstress>I was very touched by your reasoning when you say that
            as neither of you are in as good health as appears desirable on an occasion like this,
            you had a kind of doubt, and in any case a feeling of pity for the child to come
            traversed your soul. This child in this case, has it, even before its birth, been less
            well loved than the child of very healthy parents, whose first impulse would have been a
            keen joy? Surely not. We know so little about life that we’re not really in a position
            to judge between good and bad, just or unjust, and to say that one is unhappy because
            one suffers hasn’t been proved. You should know that Roulin’s child came to them smiling
            and very healthy, while the parents were at bay. So take it as it is, wait with
            confidence and possess your soul with a long patience as an old saying has it, and with
            good will. Let nature take its course.</p>
        <p>As to what you say about Theo’s health, my dear sister, while sharing your anxieties with
            all my heart I must nevertheless reassure you, precisely because I’ve seen that his
            health is changeable and uneven rather than weak, as is mine, for that matter.</p>
        <p>I very much like to believe that illnesses sometimes cure us, i.e. that when the illness
            comes to a crisis it’s a thing necessary to the recovery of a normal state of body. No,
            subsequent to the marriage he’ll regain his strength, still having the reserve of youth
            and power to restore him.</p>
        <p><unstress reason="family">I’m very pleased that he’s no longer alone, and truly I don’t doubt that he’ll regain his
            former temperament after a while. And then above all when he’s a father and the feeling
            of fatherhood comes to him, that will be a considerable gain.</unstress></p>
        <p>In my life as a painter, and above all when I’m in the country, it’s not so difficult for
            me to be alone, because in the country one feels the bonds that unite us all more
            easily. But in town, as he has done his ten consecutive years with the Goupils in Paris,
            it isn’t possible to live alone. So with patience it will return.</p>
        <p><work mention="vague">I’m going to Arles tomorrow to fetch the canvases that are still over there, which I’ll
            send you shortly. And I’m going to send you some as soon as possible to try to give you
            peasant thoughts, even though you’re in town.</work></p>
        <p>This morning I talked a little with the doctor here – he told me – which was absolutely
            what I had already thought – that one must wait a year before believing oneself to be
            cured, since the smallest thing could bring on another attack.</p>
        <p><unstress reason="money">Then he offered to take my furniture here so that we don’t have double expenses.</unstress> Tomorrow
            I’ll go and talk about that in Arles with Mr Salles.</p>
        <p> When I came here I left 50 francs with Mr Salles to settle up with the hospital in
            Arles, he’ll certainly have some over. But having again quite often needed various
            things, the surplus that Mr Peyron had here is exhausted. <stress reason="money">I’m a little surprised myself
            that in living with the greatest possible sobriety and regularity for the last 6 months,
            without having my independent studio, I’m not spending less or producing more than the
            previous, relatively less sober year.</stress> <bad_health>And inwardly I feel neither more nor less remorse
            &amp;c. if you like. Suffice to say that everything one calls good and bad is however
            quite relative, it seems to me. I live soberly here because I have the opportunity to. I
            drank before because I no longer knew how to do otherwise. Anyway it’s all the same to
            me!!! Sobriety, very calculated it’s true, nevertheless leads to a state of being in
            which thought, if you have any, flows more easily. Anyway it’s a difference like
            painting grey or coloured. I’m in fact going to paint more greyly.</bad_health></p>
        <p><stress reason="money">Only instead of paying money to a landlord we’re giving it to the asylum, I don’t see the
            difference – and it’s scarcely cheaper. The work is a thing apart, and has always cost
            me a lot.</stress></p>
        <p>I thank you very much for the consignment of colours and canvas, which I’m very pleased
            with. <work origin="new" stage="planned">I hope to go and redo the olive trees.</work> There are unfortunately very few vineyards
            here.</p>
        <p>My health is good, though, and I have a feeling quite similar to the one I had when I was
            much younger, when I was also very sober, too much so, I believe they used to say. But
            it’s all the same, I’ll try to get by.</p>
        <p>As regards being godfather to a son of yours, while first of all it could be a girl,
            truly, in the circumstances I would prefer to wait until I’m no longer here. Then Mother
            would certainly set her heart a little on him being called after our father, I for one
            would find that more logical in the circumstances.</p>
        <p><good_health>I enjoyed myself very much yesterday reading Measure for measure.</good_health> Then I read Henry VIII,
            in which there are such beautiful passages, like the one about Buckingham, and Wolsey’s
            words after his downfall.</p>
        <p>I think I’m lucky to be able to read or reread this at my leisure, and then I very much
            hope to read Homer at last. <unstress reason="environment">Outside the cicadas are singing fit to burst, a strident cry
            ten times louder than that of the crickets, and the scorched grass is taking on
            beautiful tones of old gold. And the beautiful towns of the south are in the state of
            our dead towns along the Zuiderzee, which were formerly lively. While in the downfall
            and the decline of things, the cicadas dear to good old Socrates have remained. And
            here, certainly, they’re still singing old Greek.</unstress></p>
        <p>If our friend Isaäcson heard them, his face would light up.</p>
        <p>What Jo writes about you always eating at home, that’s perfect. Anyway, I think that’s
            going very well, and once again, while sharing with all my heart all possible worries
            about Theo’s health, within me the hope predominates that in this case a more or less
            sickly condition is only the result of the efforts of nature to right itself. Patience.
            Mauve always claimed that nature was good, and even a lot more than one usually thought.
            Is there anything in his past that proves that he was wrong. His fits of melancholy in
            his last days, do you think? I myself would be inclined to believe otherwise.</p>
        <p>More soon, but I wanted to write to you straightaway that this morning’s news gives me
            great pleasure. Handshakes and</p>
    </body>
    <close>Ever yours,</close>
