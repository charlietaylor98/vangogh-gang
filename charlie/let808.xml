      <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
      <body>
            <p>I was longing for your letter and so I was very happy to receive it, and to see from
                  it that you’re well, as are Jo and the friends you speak of.</p>
            <p>I must ask you to send me the whites I asked for as soon as possible, and to add to
                  them some canvas, 5 metres or 10, whichever suits. Then I must begin by telling
                  you a piece of rather vexing news, as I see it. <stress reason="money">It’s that during the stay here
                  there have been a few expenses which I thought Mr Peyron had notified you about as
                  they occurred, which he told me the other day he hadn’t done, with the result that
                  it has mounted up to around 125 francs, deducting from it the 10 you sent by
                  postal order.</stress></p>
            <p>It’s for paint, canvas, frames and stretching frames, my trip the other day to Arles,
                  a piece of linen clothing, and various repairs.</p>
            <p>I’m using two colours here, lead white and ordinary blue, but in quite large
                  quantities, and the canvas, that’s for when I want to work on unprepared, stronger
                  canvas.</p>
            <p>This comes unfortunately just at this time when I would gladly have repeated my trip
                  to Arles etc.</p>
            <p><unstress reason="environment">That said, I’ll tell you that we’re having some superb autumn days, and that I’m
                  taking advantage of them.</unstress> <work origin="new" stage="finished">I have a few studies, among others a mulberry tree, all
                  yellow on stony ground standing out against the blue of the sky, in which study I
                  think that you’ll see that I’ve found Monticelli’s track.</work> <work mention="vague">You’ll have received the
                  consignment of canvases I sent you last Saturday.</work></p>
            <p>It surprises me a lot that Mr Isaäcson wants to do an article on studies of mine. I’d
                  willingly urge him to wait a little longer, his article would lose absolutely
                  nothing by it, and with another year of work I could hope to put more
                  characteristic things in front of him with more willpower in the drawing, more
                  knowledge of the Provençal south. </p>
            <p>Mr Peyron was very kind to talk of my case in those terms – I haven’t dared ask him
                  to go to Arles one of these days, which I’d very much like to do, believing that
                  he would disapprove. Not, though, that I suspected that he believed there was a
                  connection between my previous trip and the crisis that closely followed it. <stress reason="friendship">The
                  thing is that there are a few people over there whom I felt and once again feel
                  the need to see again.</stress></p>
            <p> While I don’t have here in the south, like good Prévost , a mistress who holds me
                  captive, I couldn’t help becoming attached to people and things.</p>
            <p>And now that I’m staying on here for the time being, and will most probably spend the
                  winter here – in the spring – in the fine season, shall I not stay here too? That
                  will depend on my health above all.</p>
            <p>What you say of Auvers is nevertheless a very agreeable prospect to me, and sooner or
                  later that ought to be fixed without seeking further. If I come to the north, even
                  supposing that there’s no room in this Doctor’s home, it’s probable that he would,
                  on père Pissarro’s recommendation and your own, find either board with a family or
                  quite simply at the inn. The main thing is to know the doctor so that, in the
                  event of a crisis, one doesn’t fall into the hands of the police and isn’t
                  forcibly carried off into an asylum.</p>
            <p>And I can assure you that the north will interest me like a brandnew country. </p>
            <p>But anyway, for the moment there’s therefore nothing that’s absolutely hurrying
                  us.</p>
            <p>I reproach myself for being so behind with my correspondence, I’d like to write to
                  Isaäcson, Gauguin and Bernard. But writing doesn’t always come, and what’s more,
                  work is pressing. Yes, I’d like to say to Isaäcson that he would do well to wait
                  longer, there isn’t yet that in it that I hope to attain if my health continues.
                  It’s not worth mentioning anything about my work at the moment. When I’m back, at
                  best it will form a kind of ensemble, ‘Impressions of Provence’.</p>
            <p>But what does he want to say now when the olive trees, the fig trees, the vineyards,
                  the cypresses must be more accentuated, all characteristic things, the same as the
                  Alpilles, which must get more character.</p>
            <p>How I’d like to see what Gauguin and Bernard have brought back.</p>
            <p><work origin="new" stage="finished">I have a study of two yellowed poplars on a background of mountains, and a view of
                  the park here, autumnal effect, some of the draughtsmanship of which is more naive
                  and more – at home.</work></p>
            <p>Anyway, it’s difficult to leave a land before having something to prove that one has
                  felt and loved it. </p>
            <p><work origin="new" stage="planned">If I come back to the north I plan to do a whole lot of Greek studies, you know,
                  painted studies with white and blue and only a little orange, just like in the
                  open air.</work></p>
            <p>I must draw and seek style. Yesterday at the almoner’s here I saw a painting that
                  made an impression on me. A Provençal lady with an intelligent, purebred face, in
                  a red dress. A figure like the ones Monticelli thought of.</p>
            <p>It wasn’t without great faults, but there was simplicity in it, and how sad it is to
                  see how much they have degenerated from it here, as we have from ours in
                  Holland.</p>
            <p>I’m writing to you in haste so as not to wait to answer your kind letter, hoping that
                  you’ll write again without delaying long.</p>
            <p>I’ve seen more very beautiful subjects for tomorrow – in the mountains.</p>
            <p>Kind regards to Jo and to our friends, above all when you get the chance thank père
                  Pissarro for his information, which will certainly be useful.</p>
            <p>Shaking both your hands, believe me</p>
      </body>
      <close>Ever yours,</close>
