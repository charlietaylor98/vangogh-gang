      <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
      <body>
            <p>Enclosed I’m sending you a letter from Mother, naturally you know all the news it
                  contains. I think it’s very logical of Cor to go there. What is different there
                  from staying in Europe is that down there one doesn’t have to undergo the
                  influence of our large cities, as one does here, so old that everything in them
                  seems to be in its dotage and tottering. So instead of seeing one’s vital forces
                  and natural, native energy evaporate in circumlocution, it’s possible that one
                  might be happier far from our society. Even if it were otherwise, the fact remains
                  that it’s to act uprightly and in accordance with his upbringing for him not to
                  hesitate to accept this position. So now it isn’t to tell you all this news that
                  you know that I’m sending you the letter. But it’s for you to observe in it a
                  little how remarkably firm and regular the writing is when one thinks that it’s
                  true what she says, that she’s ‘a mother approaching 70’. <unstress reason="family">And as you’ve already
                  written to me, and our sister has too, that she seems to have got younger, I see
                  it myself from this very clear writing and in her tighter logic in what she
                  writes, and the simplicity with which she appreciates facts. I believe now that
                  this rejuvenation has obviously come to her from the fact that she’s happy that
                  you’ve got married, which she’d wanted for so long; and I congratulate you that
                  your marriage can give you and Jo the rather rare pleasure of seeing your mother
                  growing young again.</unstress> <stress reason="family">It’s really for that that I’m sending you this letter.
                  Because, my dear brother, it’s sometimes necessary later to remember – and it’s so
                  timely that, at the very moment when she’ll have the great pain of being separated
                  from Cor – and it will be hard on her, that – she should be consoled by knowing
                  that you’re married. If the thing were possible you shouldn’t wait fully a whole
                  year before returning to Holland, for she’ll be longing to see you again, you and
                  your wife.</stress></p>
            <p>At the same time, having married a Dutchwoman, that could in a few years, sooner or
                  later, warm up business relations with Amsterdam or The Hague again.</p>
            <p><unstress reason="family">Anyway, once again I haven’t seen a letter from Mother indicating so much inner
                  serenity and calm contentment as this one – not for many years. And I’m sure that
                  this comes from your marriage. It’s said that pleasing one’s parents brings a long
                  life.</unstress></p>
            <p>I now thank you very much for the consignment of colours, deduct them from the order
                  placed since, but if it’s at all possible, not for the quantity of white. I thank
                  you also very cordially for the Shakespeare. It will help me not to forget the
                  little English I know – but above all it’s so beautiful.</p>
            <p>I’ve begun to read the series I know the least well, which before, being distracted
                  by something else or not having the time it was impossible for me to read, the
                  series of the kings. I’ve already read Richard II, Henry IV and half of Henry V. I
                  read without reflecting on whether the ideas of the people of that time are the
                  same as ours, or what becomes of them when one places them face to face with
                  republican or socialist beliefs &amp;c. But what touches me in it, as in the work
                  of certain novelists of our time, is that the voices of these people, which in
                  Shakespeare’s case reach us from a distance of several centuries, don’t appear
                  unknown to us. It’s so alive that one thinks one knows them and sees it.</p>
            <p>So what Rembrandt alone, or almost alone, has among painters, that tenderness in the
                  gazes of human beings we see either in the Pilgrims at Emmaus, or in the Jewish
                  bride, or in some strange figure of an angel as in the painting you had the good
                  fortune to see – that heartbroken tenderness, that glimpse of a superhuman
                  infinite which appears so natural then, one encounters it in many places in
                  Shakespeare. And then serious or gay portraits like the Six, like the traveller,
                  like the Saskia, it’s above all full of that. What a good idea Victor Hugo’s son
                  had of translating all of it into French so that it’s thus within the reach of
                  all. When I think of the Impressionists and of all these presentday questions of
                  art, how many lessons there are precisely for us in there.</p>
            <p>So from what I’ve just read the idea comes to me that the Impressionists are right a
                  thousand times over. Yet even they must think about it for a long time and always.
                  If it follows from that that they have the right or the duty to do themselves
                  justice, </p>
            <p> and if they dare call themselves primitives, certainly they’d do well to learn to be
                  primitive as people a little, too, before pronouncing the word primitive like a
                  title that would give them rights to whatsoever. But those who would be the cause
                  of the Impressionists being unhappy, well naturally the case for them is serious,
                  also when they make light of it.</p>
            <p>And then it would appear that waging a battle seven times a week couldn’t go on.</p>
            <p>It’s amazing, though, how L’abbesse de Jouarre, when you think of it, holds its own
                  even beside Shakespeare.</p>
            <p> I think that Renan treated himself to that in order to be able to say beautiful
                  words for once in full and at his ease, because these are beautiful words.</p>
            <p><work mention="vague">So that you may have an idea of what I have on the go I’m sending you ten or so
                  drawings today, all after canvases on the go.</work></p>
            <p><work origin="existing" stage="middle">The latest one begun is the wheatfield where there’s a little reaper and a big sun.
                  The canvas is all yellow with the exception of the wall and the bottom of purplish
                  hills.</work> <work origin="existing" stage="middle">The canvas with almost the same subject differs in coloration, being a
                  greyish green and a white and blue sky.</work></p>
            <p><stress reason="friendship">How I think of Reid as I read Shakespeare, and how I’ve thought of him several times
                  when I was iller than at present. Finding that I’d been infinitely too harsh and
                  perhaps discouraging towards him in claiming that it was better to love painters
                  than paintings.</stress> It isn’t up to me to make distinctions like that, not even when
                  faced with the problem that we see our living friends suffering so much from the
                  lack of enough money to feed themselves and pay for their colours, and on the
                  other hand the high prices that are paid for the canvases of dead painters. In a
                  newspaper I was reading a letter from a collector of Greek objects to one of his
                  friends, which contained this phrase ‘you who love nature, I who love all that the
                  hand of man has made, this difference in our tastes deep down creates the unity in
                  it’. And I found that better than my reasoning.</p>
            <p><work mention="vague">I have a canvas of cypresses with a few ears of wheat, poppies, a blue sky, which is
                  like a multicoloured Scottish plaid.</work> This one, which is impasted like the
                  Monticellis, <work mention="vague">and the wheatfield with the sun that represents extreme heat, also
                  thickly impasted,</work> <stress reason="friendship">I think that this would explain to him more or less, however,
                  that he couldn’t lose much by being our friend. But that’s true on our side too,
                  and precisely because we were perhaps right to disapprove of his method we ought
                  on our side to take a step towards reconciliation.</stress> Anyway, I daren’t yet write now
                  for fear of saying too many foolish things, but when I’m more certain of my pen
                  I’d very much like to write to him one day. It’s the same for other friends, but I
                  really have told myself that I should wait as long as possible before being able,
                  even in the best of circumstances, to arrive at this ‘being a little more certain
                  of myself’.</p>
            <p><work mention="vague">I still have canvases in Arles that weren’t dry when I left, I very much want to go
                  and get them one of these days in order to send them to you. There are half a
                  dozen of them. The drawings appear to me to have little colour this time, and this
                  is very probably due to the oversmooth paper.</work></p>
            <p><work origin="existing" stage="finished">Anyway, the Weeping tree</work> and <work origin="existing" stage="finished">the Courtyard of the hospital at Arles</work> are more
                  coloured, but that though will give you an idea of what I have on the go. The
                  canvas of the reaper will become something like the Sower of the other year.</p>
            <p>As later the books of Zola will remain beautiful precisely because they have
                  life.</p>
            <p><stress reason="family">What also has life is the fact that Mother is happy that you’re married, and I think
                  that this cannot be disagreeable to yourselves, you and Jo. But the separation
                  from Cor will be so hard for her that it’s difficult to imagine.</stress> It is precisely
                  in learning to suffer without complaining, learning to consider pain without
                  repugnance, that one risks vertigo a little; and yet it might be possible, yet one
                  glimpses even a vague probability that on the other side of life we’ll glimpse
                  justifications for pain, which seen from here sometimes takes up the whole horizon
                  so much that it takes on the despairing proportions of a deluge. Of that we know
                  very little, of proportions, and it’s better to look at a wheatfield, even in the
                  state of a painting. I shake your hands firmly and will have news of you soon I
                  hope. Good health to you both.</p>
