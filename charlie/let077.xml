    <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
    <body>
        <p>I arrived here safe and sound yesterday afternoon at 1 o’clock, and one of my first
            impressions was that the window of the notverylarge school looks out over the sea.</p>
        <p>It’s a boarding school and there are 24 boys between the ages of 10 and 14. </p>
        <p>Mr Stokes is out of town for a couple of days and so I haven’t seen His Honour yet, but
            he’s expected back this evening.</p>
        <p>There’s another assistant teacher, 17 years old. </p>
        <p>Yesterday evening and this morning we all took a walk by the sea. Herewith a bit of
            seaweed.</p>
        <p><unstress reason="environment">The houses on the seafront are mostly built of yellow
                brick in the style of those in Nassaulaan in The Hague (but taller), and have
                gardens full of cedars and other dark evergreen shrubs. There’s a harbour full of
                all kinds of ships, closed in by stone jetties running into the sea on which one can
                walk. And further out one sees the sea in its natural state, and that’s
                beautiful.</unstress>
            <stress reason="environment">Yesterday everything was grey.</stress></p>
        <p>I’m shortly going to unpack my trunks which have just been brought, and hang up some
            prints in my room. (The assistant teacher, 4 boys and I sleep in another house close
            by.)</p>
        <p>It’s the holidays just now, so I haven’t had to give any lessons yet. I’m anxious to see
            Mr Stokes. I must go out with the boys, adieu.</p>
