    <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
    <body>
        <p>Herewith you’ll find the 2 books I promised you. I’ve marked a few things in them, but
            you’ll certainly find many beautiful things in addition to these. As I wrote to you
            already, though, one starts to grow especially fond of them when one lives in the
            country itself.</p>
        <p><unstress reason="environment">It’s already Saturday evening again; the weather’s beautiful today: the sea is very calm
            and it’s low tide at the moment, the sky is a delicate whitish blue with a haze in the
            distance. Early this morning it was also beautiful, everything was clear, where now it’s
            more or less hazy</unstress>.</p>
        <p>This town has something very singular, one notices the sea in everything; but you know
            this special quality, too, because one finds it in The Hague and Scheveningen as well.
            Did you know that Anna has received an answer to her advertisements? This week she sent
            me 3 letters she’d received. I’m longing to hear what she’s decided. One of the letters
            came from Amsterdam, a situation as companion to an old lady, another letter was from
            Vaals and yet another from here in England. She may have received even more since
            then.</p>
        <p>She seems awfully eager for an opportunity to come into contact with families; in
            Amsterdam she would find this at once through Uncle Cor and Uncle Stricker.</p>
        <p>Do you still visit Uncle Cor now and then? <stress reason="family">Sometimes I long to see him so much; just
            yesterday I wrote to him.</stress> Keep him as your friend, there can’t be any harm in that.
            Sometime you must tell Mr Tersteeg about the school here. These are really happy days,
            the ones I’m spending here, day after day, and yet it’s a happiness and peacefulness
            that I don’t trust entirely, though one thing can lead to another.</p>
        <p><bad_health>A person isn’t easily satisfied, one moment he finds things far too good and the next
            he’s not satisfied enough. But I’m saying this by the by, we would do better not to talk
            about it, but rather continue quietly on our way.</bad_health> Have a good Sunday morning, and give
            my regards to everyone at the Rooses’, also to Mr and Mrs Tersteeg and Betsy, and in
            thought a handshake from</p>
