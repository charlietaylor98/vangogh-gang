    <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
    <body>
        <p>Van Iterson just came and surprised me, I think it’s nice that he came, but it’s as
            though he were a person from another world, so much lies between the time when we were
            in the firm together and now.</p>
        <p>Herewith the ‘Wijde wijde wereld’ and another little book, give one of them to
            Caroline.</p>
        <p>How much I’d like you to be able to see it here.</p>
        <p>I hope to walk to London on Saturday morning at 4 o’clock to visit Gladwell and others. I
            wish you could walk along with me.</p>
        <p>A hearty handshake in thought. Adieu, believe me,</p>
    </body>
    <close>Your most loving brother</close>
