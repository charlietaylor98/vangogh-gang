      <head>8 October 1889</head><salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
      <body>
            <p><work origin="existing" stage="finished">I’ve just brought back a canvas I’ve been working on for some time, once again of the
                  same field as the one of the reaper.</work> Now it’s mounds of earth and the background
                  parched lands, then the rocks of the Alpilles. A bit of bluegreen sky with small
                  white and violet cloud. In the foreground: A thistle and some dry grass. A peasant
                  dragging a bundle of straw in the middle. It’s another harsh study, and instead of
                  being almost entirely yellow it makes an almost completely violet canvas. Broken
                  and neutral violets.</p>
            <p>But I’m writing you this because I think that this will complement the reaper and
                  will make it easier to see what it is. For the reaper appears done at random, and
                  this with it will balance it. <work origin="existing" stage="finished">As soon as it’s dry I’ll send it to you with the
                  repetition of the bedroom.</work> I seriously ask you to show them together, if someone
                  or other comes to see the studies, because of the opposition of the
                  complementaries.</p>
            <p><work origin="new" stage="finished">Then this week I’ve done the entrance to a quarry, which is like a Japanese thing,
                  you’ll well remember that there are Japanese drawings of rocks where grasses and
                  little trees grow here and there.</work> There are moments between times when nature is
                  superb, autumnal effects glorious in colour, green skies contrasting with yellow,
                  orange, green vegetation, earth in all shades of violet, burnt grass where the
                  rains have nevertheless given a last vigour to certain plants, which again start
                  to produce little violet, pink, blue, yellow flowers. Things that make you quite
                  melancholy not to be able to render them.</p>
            <p>And the skies – like our northern skies, but the colours of the sunsets and sunrises
                  are more varied and more pure. As in works by Jules Dupré and Ziem.</p>
            <p><work origin="new" stage="finished">I also have two views of the park and the asylum in which this place appears most
                  agreeable.</work> I tried to reconstruct the thing as it may have been by simplifying and
                  accentuating the proud, unchanging nature of the pines and the cedar bushes
                  against the blue. </p>
            <p>Anyway – if they should happen to remember me – which I’m not keen on – there’ll be
                  enough to send something coloured to the Vingtistes. But I’m indifferent to that.
                  What I’m not indifferent to is that a man who is far superior to me, Meunier, has
                  painted the female thrutchers of the Borinage and the shift going to the pit and
                  the factories, their red roofs and their black chimneys against a delicate grey
                  sky – all things I’ve dreamed of doing, feeling that it hadn’t been done and that
                  it ought to be painted. And still, there’s an infinite number of subjects there
                  for artists, and one should go down into the depths and paint the light
                  effects.</p>
            <p><stress reason="career">If you haven’t yet sent the canvas and the colours, you should know that I now have
                  absolutely no canvas.</stress></p>
            <p><stress reason="money">And I was going to ask you if you would find it difficult to send the amount of what
                  I owe to Mr Peyron immediately, if it was possible for you then to send me about
                  fifteen francs by postal order, I would go to Arles one of these days.</stress></p>
            <p><stress reason="friendship">It often seems to me that if Gauguin had remained here he wouldn’t have lost
                  anything, for I clearly see, also in the letter he wrote me, that he isn’t
                  entirely at the top of his form.</stress> And I know well the cause of that – they’re too
                  hard up to find models, and living as cheaply as he thought possible at the
                  beginning won’t have lasted. However, with his patience, next year will perhaps be
                  dazzling. But then he won’t have Bernard with him if the latter does his military
                  service.</p>
            <p>Do you sense how much the figures of Jules Breton and Billet and others will remain?
                  Those people overcame the difficulty of models, and that’s a lot. And a painting
                  like that by Otto Weber from the good period (not the English) is bound to hold
                  its own. One swallow doesn’t make a summer, and one new idea doesn’t in any way
                  destroy works that have been done and perfected. That’s the terrible thing about
                  the Impressionists, that the development of the thing gets stuck, and that for
                  years they’re left facing obstacles that the preceding generation had overcome,
                  the difficulty of money and models. And so Breton, Billet and others really are
                  certain to mock it and be astonished and say: ‘come on, when are we going to see
                  your peasants and your peasant women?’ As for me, I feel ashamed and defeated.</p>
            <p><work origin="new" stage="finished">I’ve copied that woman with a child sitting beside a hearth by Mrs DemontBreton,
                  almost all violet,</work> I’m certainly going to continue copying, it will give me a
                  collection of my own, and when it’s </p>
            <p> sufficiently large and complete I’ll give the whole lot to a school.</p>
            <p>I can also tell you that next consignment you’ll become better acquainted with good
                  Tartarin’s Alpilles, which up to now – apart from the canvas of the mountains –
                  you haven’t yet seen unfold, except in the distant background of the canvases. <work origin="new" stage="finished">I
                  have a study, rougher than the previous one of the mountains. A very wild ravine
                  where a slender stream weaves its way along its bed of rocks.</work></p>
            <p>It’s all violet. I could certainly do an entire series of these Alpilles, for having
                  seen them for a long time now I’ve got used to it a little. You remember that fine
                  landscape by Monticelli that we saw at Delarebeyrette’s, of a tree on some rocks
                  against a sunset. There are a lot of effects like that at the moment, only I can’t
                  ever be outside at the time the sun sets, otherwise I would have tried it.</p>
            <p><unstress reason="family">Does Jo continue in good health? I think that all in all this year is happier for you
                  than the preceding ones.</unstress><good_health> As for me, my health has been good lately – I really
                  think that Mr Peyron is right when he says that strictly speaking I’m not mad, for
                  my thoughts are absolutely normal and clear between times, and even more than
                  before, but during the crises it’s terrible however, and then I lose consciousness
                  of everything.</good_health> But it drives me to work and to seriousness, as a coalminer who is
                  always in danger makes haste in what he does. Our mother and sister will be making
                  their preparations to move house.</p>
            <p>I’m enclosing a note for Isaäcson, Bernard and Gauguin. Naturally there’s no urgency
                  at all to get it to them. The first time they come to see you will suffice. In the
                  evenings I’m bored to death, my God the prospect of winter isn’t a cheery one.</p>
            <p>I hope that you’ll have received the canvases sent about ten days ago in good
                  order.</p>
            <p>I’m going off for a long hike in the mountains to look for sites. More soon – above
                  all send the paint and the canvas if it hasn’t been sent, for I’ve no canvas left
                  at all, nor any zinc white.</p>
            <p>Kind regards to Jo.</p>
