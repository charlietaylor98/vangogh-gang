            <p> Well, what do you say about Anna? <unstress reason="family">It surprised me, and it
                    seems to be serious too, and will certainly take place, one would venture to
                    say. It could be good.</unstress> The difficulties of holding a subordinate
                position, especially when one perseveres in it for a longer period, as she has in
                fact done for years in all honour and virtue, are very great and sometimes become a
                hard struggle, and the seemingly easy becomes extremely difficult. </p>
            <p>There’s nevertheless much poetry in it, and such years are a treasure not easily
                lost, and when one denies and humbles oneself, especially the first time, one has a
                wonderful feeling of inner peace, <bad_health>but I would understand very well if
                    the future was sometimes dark for her too</bad_health> – it might be sensible of
                her, for her part, to have already decided to take this step. And I also maintain
                that she truly loves him, I believe that and trust in it absolutely, otherwise
                things wouldn’t have gone this far. And so I sincerely hope that she won’t be
                disappointed but that this, with God’s guidance, will be the path to her lasting
                happiness. May the Lord grant that she find peace, that dear sister, and bless her,
                and give her good things in life. On this occasion I congratulate you, too, as I
                have Anna and Pa and Ma. </p>
            <p>How are you, old chap? I had wanted to write to you earlier and answer your last
                letter. I have a lot to do and the work isn’t easy.</p>
            <p><unstress reason="environment">Then again, I go to church a lot, there are beautiful
                    old churches here, and outstanding preachers, I often hear Uncle Stricker, and
                    what he says is very good, and he speaks with much warmth and feeling.
                </unstress>I’ve heard the Rev. Laurillard three times, you would like him too,
                because he paints, as it were, and his work is at once lofty and noble art. He has
                the feeling of an artist in the true sense of the word, as someone like Andersen had
                when he says, for example:</p>
            <p>Every evening came the moon and whispered in my ear, Telling of the quiet night and
                what its eye Had lit on from its watchpost in the sky. It who knows centuries –
                through ages did it roam, Casting, high above the Flood and crest of foam, On the
                floating ark a soft silver glow, Just as it now lights my lonely window Then, too,
                when the folk of Israel knelt down To weep by the waters of Babylon It illumined
                with sad twinkling down below The unstrung harp, hanging on the willow.</p>
            <p> The moon still shines now, and the sun and the evening star, which is fortunate, and
                they often speak of God’s Love and call to mind the words, lo, I am with you alway,
                even unto the end of the world. </p>
            <p>
                <work origin="new" stage="middle">Am busy making a summary of the history of the
                    Reformation</work>, there’s much that is stimulating and appealing in the
                history of those days. </p>
            <p>
                <unstress reason="environment">The room in the Trippenhuis where Rembrandt’s Syndics
                    are hanging is open again; coming from church yesterday I walked over there for
                    a while,</unstress> hanging right next to the Rembrandt is that portrait by Van
                der Helst. </p>

        <body>
            <p>Many happy returns of the day.</p>
            <p>It really was important news in your last letter — and I think you’ll be glad that
                the situation has at least become clearer.</p>
            <p>Am really looking forward to your next letter.</p>
            <p>As regards the work, <work origin="new" stage="middle">I’m doing a fairly large
                    painting of a weaver — the loom straight on from the front — the little figure a
                    dark little silhouette against the white wall.</work>
                <work stage="middle" origin="existing">And at the same time also the one I started
                    in the winter, a loom on which a piece of red cloth is being woven — there the
                    loom is seen from the side. </work><work origin="new" stage="middle">I’ve also
                    started on two others of effects on the heath. And a thing with Pollard
                    birches.</work></p>
            <p>I’ll have a lot more hard graft on those looms — but in reality the things are such
                almighty beautiful affairs — all that old oak against a greyish wall — that I
                certainly believe it’s right that they should be painted. We must make sure that we
                get them so that the colour and tone match with other Dutch paintings, though. <work
                    stage="planned" origin="new"> I hope to start on two more of weavers soon, where
                    the figure will appear very differently, that’s to say where the weaver isn’t
                    sitting behind it but is arranging the threads for the cloth.</work> I’ve seen
                them weaving by lamplight in the evening, which creates very Rembrandtesque effects.
                Nowadays they have a sort of hanging lamp — but I’ve just got a little lamp from a
                weaverlike the one in The evening by Millet, for instance. This is what they used to
                work by.</p>
            <p>I recently also saw coloured pieces woven in the evening — where I’ll take you
                sometime should you come here. When I saw it, they were also just arranging the
                threads, so dark, bowed figures against the light, which stood out against the
                colour of the piece. Great shadows cast on the white walls by the laths and beams of
                the loom.</p>
            <p>Regards — do write soon if you can.</p>

        <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
        <body>
            <p>Thanks for your letter and 150 francs enclosed. I also received the two new
                Lhermittes today. He’s a master of the figure. He’s able to do what he likes with it
                — conceiving the whole neither from the colour nor from the local tone, but rather
                proceeding from the light — as Rembrandt did — there’s something astonishingly
                masterly in everything he does — in modelling, above all things, he utterly
                satisfies the demands of honesty.</p>
            <p>A great deal is said about — Poussin. Bracquemond talks about him, too. The French
                call Poussin their greatest ever painter among the old masters. Well it’s certain
                that what’s said about Poussin, whom I know so very little about, I find in
                Lhermitte and in Millet. But with this distinction, that it seems to me Poussin is
                the original grain, the others are the full ear. For my part, then, I rate today’s
                    superior.<stress reason="environment">This last fortnight I’ve had a great deal
                    of trouble with the reverend gentlemen of the priesthood, who gave me to
                    understand — of course with the best of intentions and, no less than others,
                    believing that it was their duty to interfere — who gave me to understand that I
                    shouldn’t be too familiar with people beneath my station — who, having spoken to
                    me in those terms, spoke in a very different tone to the ‘people of lower
                    station’, that’s to say with threats that they mustn’t allow themselves to be
                    painted.</stress> This time I simply went straight to the burgomaster and told
                him exactly what had happened, and pointed out that this was none of the priests’
                business and that they should stick to their own province of more abstract things.
                In any event, I’m not encountering any more opposition for the time being, and I
                think it quite possible that that’s how it will remain. A girl I’d often painted was
                having a child and they thought it was mine, although it wasn’t me. However, knowing
                the facts of the matter from the girl herself and it being a case in which a member
                of the priest’s congregation in Nuenen had behaved extremely badly, they can’t get
                their teeth into me, at least not this time. But you see that it isn’t easy to paint
                people at home and draw them as they go about their business. Anyway — they won’t
                easily win in this case, and this winter I do hope to keep the very same models, who
                are of the old Brabant stock through and through.</p>
            <p>
                <work stage="finished" origin="new">Even so, I have a few more new drawings.</work>
            </p>
            <p>But now, in the last few days, I could not get anyone in the fields. Fortunately for
                me, the priest isn’t yet, but is nonetheless beginning to become, quite unpopular.
                It’s a bad business, though, and if it were to continue I’d probably move. You’ll
                ask what’s the point of being a disagreeable person — sometimes you have to be. If
                I’d discussed it meekly they’d have ground me down without mercy. And when they
                hinder me in my work, sometimes the only way I know is an eye for an eye, a tooth
                for a tooth. The priest went so far as to promise the people money if they didn’t
                allow themselves to be painted — however, the people replied very pertly that they’d
                rather earn it from me than go cap in hand to him. But you see, they only do it for
                the sake of earning money and I don’t get anything done for nothing around here. You
                ask me whether Rappard has ever sold anything. I know he’s flusher at present than
                before, that for a long time, for instance, he had a nude model day after day, that
                for the purposes of a painting of a brickworks he’s now rented a small house
                actually on the spot and altered it so that he had light from above — I know that
                he’s been on another trip through Drenthe and that he’s also going to Terschelling.
                That all of this is pretty expensive, and the money for it has to come from
                somewhere. That although he may have money of his own, he must be earning as well,
                because otherwise he couldn’t do what he’s doing. It may be that his family is
                buying or friends, that’s possible, but at any rate somebody must be.</p>
            <p>But this evening I’m much too occupied with Lhermitte’s drawings to go on writing any
                more about other things.</p>
            <p>When I think about Millet or about Lhermitte — then — I find modern art as great — as
                Michelangelo and Rembrandt — the old infinite, the new infinite too — the old
                genius, the new genius. Perhaps someone like Chenavard doesn’t see it like this —
                but for my part I’m convinced — that in this regard one can believe in the
                present.</p>
            <p>The fact that I have a definite belief as regards art also means that I know what I
                want to get in my own work, and that I’ll try to get it even if I go under in the
                attempt. </p>

        <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
        <body>
            <p>
                <stress reason="family">What very much distresses me in our conversation is that
                    when I say that I fear it will be tight for you this year, you reply: ‘that you
                    observe that I’d like to see that’, ‘that you see very well that you can’t rely
                    on me’, ‘that you know very well that I would be returning you no thanks for
                    your pains’. This is not so, and it distresses me that this is how you see
                    it.</stress>
                <stress reason="money"/>
            </p>
            <p>My suggestion has been this — don’t regard my little painting business as dead weight
                and don’t treat it harshly, for the reason that it could prove to be a little boat
                in a disaster when the big ship is lost. My suggestion is and remains — let’s at any
                rate keep that little boat in good condition and ready to sail, whether the storm
                comes or my anxiety proves to be unfounded. At the moment I’m a little vessel which
                you have in tow and once in a while can only seem to you to be dead weight. Which,
                by the way — as dead weight — you can leave behind by cutting the rope if you want
                to. But in this case I, who am the skipper of my small craft, ask that far from
                having the towrope cut, my little craft should be caulked and provisioned so that it
                may do better service in time of need.</p>
            <p>Should you doubt the good faith of this request, then for my part I can do nothing
                but repeat it more emphatically. <stress reason="money">For I notice that on the
                    side of the paint bill, my own little craft is springing leaks here and
                    there.</stress></p>
            <p><good_health>I’m plugging these leaks as much as I can, though, and am not yet losing
                    my coolheadedness. Am not desperate either.</good_health> But since we’ll
                perhaps both be in the same storm, I speak emphatically and, I believe, in both our
                interests.</p>
            <p>I can sum up your answer to my question thus: ‘there may be a storm coming but, even
                in that case, don’t count on either caulking or provisions, and be aware that I may
                be compelled by the force of circumstances to cut the towrope’.I can take this
                answer as a warning, but only in so far as it’s not accompanied by suspicion of my
                good faith.</p>
            <p>But — by means of this letter I cry out to you again that my request for
                reinforcement may prove to be in both our interests, and I’m not doing it just out
                of selfishness, as you assume. <stress reason="money">That in the event of a storm,
                    I in all events am willing but perhaps also able to be of some use and service
                    to you, but that this will be impossible in the event that my own craft fills
                    with water (which I’m trying to prevent, though) before the moment in question.
                    I’m trying to prevent that myself, though, but still I wouldn’t cry out to you
                    without necessity. I’m not afraid in the face of danger either, but nonetheless
                    I try to be prepared in case disaster strikes.</stress></p>
            <p>If it seems to you unfounded that I urge that we should gradually let my, but I would
                rather say our little painting business become the heart of a business that we could
                go on to undertake together, <unstress reason="career">for my part I insist that it
                    can and will become something if we can remain sufficiently united.</unstress>If
                I don’t have the same ideas as you, don’t suspect me of bad faith or base intentions
                anyway, either towards you or towards those at home. I do nothing to those at home
                that I have no right to do, since I absolutely and always keep out of their affairs.
                Don’t ask for or urge advice, keep entirely to my own territory — and even keep my
                feelings about their affairs to myself too, since we don’t understand one another’s
                interests anyway.</p>
            <p>And to you I speak now, and will go on speaking, as someone whose business is in
                paintings to someone else whose business is in paintings, and I will not intrude on
                the other territory.</p>
            <p>And the question that I started to discuss with you is this: even if the slump is
                severe, and even if we both have to take great trouble, we must see to it that we
                keep an energetic hand on the little painting business that belongs to you as well
                as to me. I say, it might be a boat that could possibly be of service to you in the
                storm, although I wish for the storm as little as you can wish for it.</p>

        <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
        <body>
            <p> I feel the need to write to you again, because I often think of you and long so much
                for Christmas, when we hope to see each other again. Well, the dark days before
                Christmas are already in sight, and behind them lies Christmas, just like the kindly
                light from the houses behind the rocks and the water that breaks against them on a
                dark evening. </p>
            <p> The Christmas celebration was always a bright spot for us, and may it remain so. </p>
            <p>
                <stress reason="career">An entrance exam has been held at the university here for
                    the first time — it’s here in the city that I’ll sit the exam as well. In
                    addition to the usual 4 subjects of Latin, Greek, algebra and geometry, they
                    also tested history, geography and Dutch.</stress>
            </p>
            <p> Have taken pains to find a teacher of Algebra and Geometry and have succeeded,
                namely a cousin of Mendes, Teixeira de Mattos, a teacher at the Jewish School for
                the Poor. He gives me hope that we’ll have met the requirements by around October of
                next year. If I should then pass the exam, things will have gone very well
                    indeed.<stress reason="career">Because when I started they said that 2 years
                    would be necessary for the first 4 subjects mentioned, whereas if I should pass
                    in October, I’ll have done more in an even shorter time. May God give me the
                    wisdom I need and grant me my heart’s desire, namely to complete my studies as
                    soon as possible and to be inducted into a living and the practical duties of a
                    minister. Doing that work, and being devoted to it, I believe one would be doing
                    what God wants one to do.</stress>
            </p>
            <p> The preparatory studies (i.e. those preceding the actual theological study and
                practice in preaching and speaking) more or less comes down to the history,
                languages and geography of Greece, Asia Minor (which can be taken to include
                Palestine) and Italy. <stress reason="career">So I have to study these just as
                    diligently as a dog gnaws a bone</stress>, and similarly I should like to know
                the languages, history and geography of the northern countries, i.e. those around
                the North Sea and the English Channel. </p>
            <p> Have finally succeeded in making a map of Asia Minor, Greece and Italy, fairly large
                (which now includes Paul’s travels as well), and also one of England which finally
                has something of what I wanted it to have, at least Mendes sees it in it, namely
                that it was not drawn without feeling and love. (I put in the names from a map in
                the Atlas Antiquus of SprunerMenke that Mendes has, because it’s one to be used for
                history.) Come on, do your best to take a look at that atlas sometime, likewise the
                one by Stieler in particular. Because it is artistry. (SprunerMenke, Atlas
                Antiquus.)On Sunday I heard the Rev. Ten Kate on John XIV:16 (In my Father’s house
                are many mansions: Whosoever says that, what our Father’s house holds in memories
                for us, what it promises us). He ended with: The hour is coming in which the dead
                shall hear the voice of the Son of the people and shall stand up, they that have
                done good, unto the Resurrection of the Eternal Life. Blessed are the homesick, for
                they shall come home. The church was so packed that I stood. </p>
            <p> Spent two evenings at Uncle Cor’s, once to look at old books (including volumes of
                L’Illustration in which I found many old acquaintances, that is really an
                interesting magazine, among other things an old portrait of Dickens and a woodcut by
                De Lemud, ‘The cup of coffee’, a young man with rather severe and sharp features and
                a serious expression who looks exactly as though he were thinking about that passage
                from The imitation, On the monastic life, or as though he were contemplating some
                difficult but good work or plan, as only a soul in need can. Such work isn’t always
                the worst, but what one does in sorrow, as it were, lives on. Happy the man who is
                instructed by Truth itself, not by signs and passing words, but as it is in itself,
                are good words). </p>
            <p> Then I was also at Uncle Cor’s on Aunt’s birthday, i.e. last Friday, they played
                cards that evening, and because I can’t I sat there reading A. Gruson, Histoire des
                croisades (Panthéon classique 50 cmes). That’s a very beautiful little book, I would
                almost say that here and there it was written with the sentiment of Thijs Maris
                (herewith, among other things, a page that struck me), such as when he paints an old
                castle on a rock with autumnal woods at twilight, with the black fields with a
                peasant ploughing with a white horse in the foreground, and it also made me think of
                Michelet and Carlyle. </p>
            <p> I should like so much for Pa to know that etching of A young citizen of the year V.
                Do you approve of giving it on Pa’s birthday or before then, along with some small
                photos of the Revolution, so that it forms a whole from which Pa can see what we
                often think about? </p>
            <p> Perhaps you already know that there have been sad tidings today from Brussels, that
                Pa has already gone there. Uncle Jan, who received a telegram containing this news
                from Ma, telegraphed Pa and received the answer ‘Condition unchanged don’t come yet
                I’m here’. Uncle Jan and Uncle Cor were already set to go there together, now
                they’re awaiting further notice from faithful Pa. Will there then finally be an end
                to that long and terrible suffering? </p>
            <p> Goodbye Theo, write soon, old boy, if you can, may God preserve our health and give
                us the clarity of mind and the strength and vigour we need every day. Uncle Jan,
                Uncle Cor and the Stricker family send you their regards, and accept a hearty
                handshake in thought from </p>

            <p> That news about Uncle Hein comes while I’m writing this.Paul Stricker will in all
                likelihood have to return to Holland because of his health. A good letter from Johan
                van Gogh, and Willem is also doing relatively well, but does have to look after

        <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
        <body>
            <p> I feel the need to write to you again, let me have a word from you too, if you have
                time. </p>
            <p> This morning I went to the early sermon, and the text was Eph. 5:14, Awake thou that
                sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light. <unstress
                    reason="environment">When I left here it was raining, and also when leaving the
                    church, though during the sermon the sun had been shining brightly through the
                    windows.</unstress>
            </p>
            <p> Pa had to lead the early service today in Etten, and afterwards Pa had to go to
                Zundert. </p>
            <p> After that I heard dear Uncle Stricker in the Oudezijdskapel on the words ‘Beware of
                the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees’, which is a warning not to become
                too attached to outward forms and ceremonies without truly sincere religious feeling
                of the heart, as opposed to a life without belief in the things that are higher than
                those in this life. There were very few people in the church, apart from the orphan
                boys and orphan girls with their red and black clothes, who filled a large part of
                the little old church nonetheless. If you come here again I hope to take you there,
                that Oudezijdskapel is in a very narrow street, Zeedijk, near the part of Buitenkant
                called ‘the old taryards’ and near Warmoesstraat. It’s a very nice part of town and
                reminds one of the heart of London, like Booksellers’ Row or some such place. May it
                be granted me in time to speak as I have heard so many do, and hear each Sunday
                again. I’m doing my best to become skilled at it with all the power in me. </p>
            <p> Last week I spent an evening at the old Rev. Meijjes’s and met his son there, the
                Rev. Jeremie Meijjes with his wife, a daughter of Professor Tilanus, and two of his
                sons – one of them attends the gymnasium here and the other is training to be an
                engineer. The latter helped to build those roofs here at the dockyard (underneath
                which the ships are built, where we went with Uncle that afternoon you were here),
                as well as the new Kattenburg bridge. It was a pleasant evening and we talked about
                all kinds of foreign matters. He’s a very gifted man and has a pure talent and a
                great faith, heard him in the Westerkerk. Saw him coming from the pulpit and walking
                through the church after the sermon, and that tall, noble figure and that tired,
                pale face and that noble head, the hair already showing some grey, made a great
                impression on me. To be tired in such a way from that work, that is a blessing. </p>
            <p> Today you’ll perhaps go to Scheveningen, have a good Sunday, how I’d like to visit
                your little room. Heard from home that you’ll probably go to see Mauve again soon in
                his house in the dunes, and will stay overnight, I can imagine you sitting there,
                and I also know what you’ll discuss. Last week Mendes told me about a very
                interesting part of the city, namely the area extending from the Leidsepoort (thus
                close to Vondelpark) to the Hollandsche Spoor station. Went there yesterday, I knew
                part of it already, and you do too, I think, namely the part near the station. There
                are a great many mills, sawmills, workers’ houses with little gardens, old houses
                too, of all kinds, and very populous, and the area is crisscrossed by all kinds of
                small canals and waterways full of barges, and all kinds of picturesque bridges and
                so on. It must certainly be a wonderful thing to be a minister in such a district. </p>
            <p> This study is difficult, old chap, but I must persevere, and to that end may He help
                me of Whom it is written: If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth
                to all men liberally, and upbraideth not. </p>
            <p> Ma wrote in her last letter something about ‘Anna’s house’, which is a new
                expression that doesn’t sound bad, she’ll perhaps be very happy one of these days,
                may she have made a good choice and one not to be repented of. The best we can do
                for the time being is, I think, simply be very happy about it. </p>
            <p> If you should happen to visit Mauve and Jet one of these days, give them my warm
                regards and spend some pleasant hours together, and bid goodday to the dunes and the
                sea for me. And tell Mauve that the photograph of his drawing, the plough in the
                field, is hanging in my little room and constantly reminds me of him. </p>
            <p> Are you reading something beautiful? I’d like so much to start reading a great many
                books but may not, if you can get hold of John Halifax do read it again, even though
                we read it with nostalgia, still, let us not say ‘that is not for me’, because it’s
                good to go on believing in everything that’s good and noble. I heard that the man
                whose life and character prompted the book to be written died recently, he was
                called Harper and ran a large bookshop in London. I once met the painter Millais on
                the street in London, <good_health>just after I had been so happy to see various of
                    his paintings,</good_health> and that noble figure made me think of John
                Halifax. Millais once painted The lost penny, a young woman looking in the early
                morning twilight for the penny she has lost (there’s an engraving of it, the lost
                mite) and not the least beautiful of his work is an autumn landscape, Chill October. </p>
            <p>Adieu, old chap, accept in thought a hearty handshake, and believe me, after giving
                my regards to your housemates, in haste, because I have to go to church, </p>

            <p><good_health>I was delighted to learn from your letter to Pa and Ma that you plan to
                    go to London</good_health> on 4 Aug. and then to come on here from there. I’m
                again looking forward very much to your arrival and to finding out what you’ll think
                of the work that I’ve done since. <work origin="existing" stage="finished">The last
                    things I did are a couple of rather large studies of oxcarts, a black ox and a

            <p>
                <work origin="new" stage="middle">And have also been working again on the old tower
                    in the fields in the evening; I’ve made a larger study of it than my previous
                    ones — with the wheatfields around it.</work>
            </p>
            <p>Rappard sent me back the little book by Vosmaer that belongs to you — I started to
                read it but — is it just me? — find it almighty boring and actually written in an
                academic, sermonizing tone. Perhaps you will too when you look at it again. Have you
                read Sapho by Daudet? <unstress reason="environment">It’s very beautiful, and so
                    vigorous, and so close to life that the female figure lives, breathes, and one
                    can hear, literally hear the voice, and forgets that one is
                reading.</unstress></p>
            <p>You’ll also <work stage="finished" origin="new">see a couple more new weavers
                </work>when you come.</p>
            <p>Nature is certainly pure here — I’m still very pleased with the studio, too.We must
                visit some farms and weavers together when you come.</p>
            <p>Rappard’s plan is to come back again in October; he’s probably in Drenthe again
                now.</p>
            <p>Well, I write in some haste because I’m hard at work. <good_health>I work a good deal
                    early in the morning or in the evening, and then sometimes everything is so

        <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
        <body>
            <p>I’ve heard from that colourman — who tells me I can send the paintings. But that he
                wants me to send them as soon as possible because there are many strangers in The
                Hague at present.</p>
            <p>
                <stress reason="money">He’s quite right there. What I want to ask you is that you
                    try to send me enough for me to get the crate made and pay the carriage. Deduct
                    it next month, if you like — but I have nothing, and it’s important to me to get
                    my consignment off immediately.</stress>
            </p>
            <p><bad_health>Your visit really left me with a less than favourable
                    impression</bad_health> — I believe more than ever that more difficulties await
                you in the next few years than you imagine.</p>
            <p>I continue to insist that it’s somewhat fatal that your energy has evidently taken a
                different direction, rather than working on our getting our heads above water with
                the painting. And yet it’s such a short while ago that you wrote that you now had
                more confidence that my work was good. You take it as though I was doing you wrong
                or was hostile to you, now I most decidedly have rather a lot of remarks to make.
                And considerable concerns for the future. I can’t speak other than I did, can I?</p>
            <p>To my mind you don’t in the least belong among the rising men now. Take this amiss of
                me — if you will — and treat me as you will accordingly. </p>
            <p>I’m willing to take back my remarks should I see very different things in you, but
                that I made them during your visit — Yes. But even though you say today, ‘I’m
                selling 500,000 francs’ worth a year’ — this doesn’t make any impression on me at
                all, since I’m only too convinced of the precariousness of it all — you keeping up
                even a half or a fifth of that and delivering in the years ahead. It’s too up in the
                air for me, too little at ground level.</p>
            <p>And art itself is solid enough, that’s not the trouble.</p>
            <p>But, ‘to be a countinghouse will pass’ was said, not by me, but by someone whose
                words came dreadfully true. And I wish you were, or would become, a painter. I put
                it bluntly, more strongly than before, because I believe so firmly that the
                largescale art trade is, in many respects, too much like tulip mania.</p>
            <p>And the positions in it dependent on chance and whim. Make a miscalculation — make
                what may be an insignificant mistake — and — what’s left of that huge figure you’re
                turning over now? That figure depends on whim.</p>
            <p>And KNOWLEDGE of art, stripped bare, is related, more closely than you think, to the
                practice of art. TRADE in paintings is something very different when one is on one’s
                own from when one works for large distributors. And it’s the same with other things,
                too. Anyway — work hard — but — try to work sensibly too.</p>
            <p>The trouble you’ve taken together with me — for providing money is also taking
                trouble and there’s absolutely no getting away from it — this trouble has at least
                been an act of personal initiative, and of personal will and energy — but what am I
                to think or say of it if, little by little, with the decided weakening of the
                financial aid, something else weren’t to be put in its place? And now, above all, to
                my mind at any rate, it’s the time to try to push ahead with my work.</p>
            <p>I’ve also been looking for addresses in Antwerp, and will hear more precisely about
                them before long. Then I can probably send things there, too. But if you want these
                things, help me to bring them about. You said to me yourself, Where there is a will
                there is a way; well then, <stress reason="money">I’ll take you at your word a
                    little as to whether you’re really seeking for us to make progress. If I were to
                    ask for extravagant things and you refused, then so be it — but where they’re
                    the most essential, the very simplest necessities, and the lack just becomes
                    more and more, and worse and worse, then I think you’re taking economy too far,
                    and in this respect it’s very far from being useful.</stress></p>

            <p>Just a word about Serret and about Portier.<stress reason="money"> Tell them as it
                    is, that is that I did have studies ready, but that I had to pay a colourman who
                    was making it difficult for me just now.</stress> That in order to put a stop to
                it, I wrote to tell him that I put his paint in my studies, and that I asked him to
                take the trouble to sell something for me instead of nagging. That I’ll go through
                with it, and have to send him things.</p>
            <p>That as to the drawings which I said I’d show Serret, since I’m in a hurry to do
                things, I need them myself. But I do still think it’s of some importance that at any
                rate he knows that I really did have them when you came, and that you tell him that
                you saw them at my place, and then also tell him exactly what you think. I won’t
                influence your own opinion. That I’m sad about your thinking that this is all right,
                though, yes — that is so.</p>
            <p>But I don’t refuse to take such measures — and even if one of these colourmen wanted
                to sell off my bits and pieces, he would be welcome to go to those lengths. It’s
                certain that the paintdealing gentlemen wouldn’t blush to do it.</p>
            <p>However, I’m fed up with talking about it; I’ve said what I had to say — and you —
                you can deal with my suggestion as you see fit. </p>
            <p><stress reason="money">And if these fellows want to attack me and sell me up, since
                    they expressly threatened me with collection, and that over matters of less than
                    30 guilders, then I won’t be able to resist them and will let them do as they
                    please, but it will be as if it happens before your very eyes, since you’ve just
                    been here.</stress> That I can’t stop the work at the level I now am, that’s
                true. <stress reason="career">I need paint every day. I must make progress,</stress>
                and <stress reason="money">if I want to pay for what I need today, then an
                    outstanding bill from yesterday will have to wait.</stress> For your
                information, this is how it is with me for the rest of the year, precisely and in
                detail — <stress reason="money">I have to pay:three suppliers who are all pestering
                    me, one 45 guilders, the other 25 guilders, the other 30 guilders. These are the
                    exact sums outstanding on accounts which have of course been much higher over
                    the course of the year, but which I pay off in cash, as much as I possibly can
                    with the utmost effort.deficit therefore 100 guilders</stress></p>
            <p>
                <stress reason="money">Add to this rent in November 25 ,, _________ 125 guilders =
                    250 francs</stress>
            </p>
            <p>Suppose I get 4 x 150 francs from you for Sept. Oct. Nov. Dec.= 600 francs. That then
                leaves 350 francs to last from now until New Year. And then bear in mind that I have
                literally nothing left this month, and that I also have to live this month.</p>
            <p>So that from Aug. – 1 January, in other words almost 5 months, I have to live and
                paint on 350 francs. Which I can do on 150 francs a month, but not easily, but
                anyway it’s possible as a minimum.</p>
            <p>
                <stress reason="career">However, if in the course of 4 months 250 francs has to be
                    deducted to pay for paint and rent, well then, the work is hampered and
                    obstructed so much that one doesn’t know what to do, and would rather say to the
                    fellows sell my things then!</stress>
                <stress reason="career">But let me work! Without hesitation I’ve just thrown this
                    month in to calm the fellows down. But the hardship that’s caused is bad
                    enough.</stress>
            </p>
            <p>And my last word on the subject is that if my work were weak and awful, I would agree
                with you if you said — ‘I can’t do anything about it’.</p>
            <p>Well — since larger and smaller painted studies as well as new drawings were able to
                make you understand that we’re making progress with it, I’m not so sure whether ‘I
                can’t do anything about it’ should be your final word. Talk to Serret, talk to
                Portier about it — and say how much I want to keep working and how little
                opportunity I have myself to find art lovers, since painting the peasants means that
                once and for all the countryside, not the city is my place of work.</p>

    </letter>
    <letter>
        <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
        <body>
            <p><unstress reason="money">Thanks for the prompt dispatch of the money for this month,
                    arriving promptly like that actually helps me more.</unstress> Thanks, too, for
                the splendid woodcut after Lhermitte — one of the few things by him that I know, for
                I saw only these — a troop of girls in the wheat — an old woman in church — and a
                miner or some such in a little bar, and Harvest by him, and otherwise never
                anything, and nothing ever as much reflecting his actual manner as these
                woodcutters.</p>
            <p>If Le Monde Illustré prints a composition by him every month — this is part of a
                series of ‘Rural months’ — it would give me mighty great pleasure to collect this
                whole series, and I’d really like you to send them every time.</p>
            <p>Because obviously I never see anything here, and after all I do need to see something
                really beautiful now and then, and so another time feel free to keep back 20 francs,
                say, but send me things like this when they appear in the illustrated magazines.Now
                as to when you write that if I had something ready that I thought was good, you
                would try to enter it for the Salon — I appreciate your wanting to do this. </p>
            <p>This in the first place — and then further that if I’d known it 6 weeks earlier, I
                would have tried to send you something for this purpose.</p>
            <p>Now, though, I don’t have anything that I would care to send in. Recently, as you
                know, <work origin="existing" stage="finished">I’ve painted heads almost
                    exclusively. And they are studies in the true meaning of the word — that is,
                    they’re meant for the studio.</work></p>
            <p>Nonetheless, this very day I’ve started to make some that I’ll send you. </p>
            <p>Because I think it possible that it might be of use, when you meet a good many people
                on the occasion of the Salon, if you had something you could show — albeit only
                studies.So you’ll receive heads of an old and a young woman, and probably more than
                one of these two models. Given what you write of your feelings about various
                conceptions of heads, I think that these, which come straight out of a cottage with
                a mossgrown thatched roof, won’t appear to you to be absolutely inappropriate,
                although they’re studies and nothing else. If I’d known 6 weeks earlier, I would
                have made a woman spinning or spooling yarn — full length — of them.</p>
            <p>To return for a moment to that question of the female heads in the Jacquet genre, not
                the earlier ones but of the present day. The reaction against them — certainly with
                a motive — by people who paint heads of girls like our sisters, for instance — I can
                well understand that there are painters who do such things — Whistler did it well
                several times — Millais, Boughton — to mention only people by whom I saw something
                of the sort in the past. I know little by FantinLatour, but what I saw I thought
                very good. Chardinesque. And that’s a lot. For my part, though, I’m not the sort of
                character who has much chance of getting on a sufficiently intimate footing with
                girls of that sort that they’re willing to pose. Particularly not with my own
                sisters. And am possibly also prejudiced against women who wear dresses. And my
                province is more those who wear jackets and skirts.</p>
            <p>Though I think what you say about it is true — namely that it’s perfectly possible to
                paint them — and it has a raison d’être as a reaction against the presentday
                Jacquets and Van Beers.</p>
            <p>Just this, though — Chardin (let’s sum up the aim of the reaction in his name,
                FantinLatour, at least, would approve), Chardin was a Frenchman and painted French
                women. And in my view, respectable Dutch women like our sisters really do
                extraordinarily often lack the charm that the French frequently have.</p>
            <p>Consequently, the socalled respectable element among Dutch women isn’t really so very
                attractive — to paint or to think about. But certain common servant girls, on the
                other hand, are very Chardinesque.</p>
            <p>
                <stress reason="career">At present I’m painting not just as long as there’s light,
                    but even in the evening by lamplight in the cottages, if I can somehow make
                    things out on my palette, in order to capture if possible something of the
                    singular effects of lighting at night, for instance with a large shadow cast on
                    the wall.</stress>
            </p>
            <p>I’ve certainly not seen anything in the last few years as fine as those woodcutters
                by Lhermitte.</p>
            <p>How his little figures in that composition are felt and wanted.</p>
            <p>Thanks again for it.</p>
        </body>
        <close>Yours truly,</close>
        <sig>Vincent</sig>
        <ps>
            <p>The Chardinesque is, it seems to me, a singular expression of simplicity and of
                goodness — both through and through, and I find it a little hard to believe that one
                would find it in our sisters, say, either one of them. But if Wil were a Frenchwoman
                rather than a minister’s daughter, she could have it. But as good as always sails to
                the opposite point of the compass.</p>

    <letter>
        <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
        <body>
            <p> I feel the need to write to you without waiting too long, the reason being first of
                all that I must thank you for three things. <good_health>First of all, for your
                    excellent fourpage letter, with which you gave me the greatest
                    pleasure</good_health>, because it does one good to feel that a brother of his
                also walks and lives on earth, <stress reason="career">when one has a lot of things
                    to think about and a lot to do, one sometimes gets the feeling, where am I? what
                    am I doing? where am I going?</stress> — and one starts to grow dizzy — but then
                such a familiar voice, or rather familiar handwriting, makes one feel firm ground
                beneath one’s feet again, as it were. </p>
            <p> T<good_health>hen I must thank you for an issue of the Galerie Contemporaine about
                    E. Frère. It’s very interesting and I’m happy to have something by
                    him.</good_health> And I also thank you for the 10 postage stamps, it really is
                too much and you shouldn’t have done so much. A hearty handshake for everything. </p>
            <p> Now I have a few things to tell you about St Nicholas; I received a good letter from
                Etten with a money order for a pair of gloves enclosed. </p>
            <p> I already had some, however, so I bought something else with the money, namely
                another map by Stieler, namely Scotland alone. At present I can get them singly at
                Seyffardt’s, but there probably won’t always be that opportunity. I’ve drawn that
                map and so have it double, and because I did want to give Harry Gladwell a Christmas
                present I hope to send it to you for him, to enclose when a crate goes to Paris. one
                must build one’s house upon a rock, Scotland, Normandy and Brittany are really
                rather rocky, just take a look at that large map of Scotland when you get it. If I
                compare the work of studying to the building of a house, and these months to its
                foundation, then rocks accordingly lie at its base. </p>
            <p> But all of this by the by, now more about the evening in question. From Uncle Cor I
                received Bossuet, Or<good_health>aisons funèbres, in a very good and handy edition,
                    very complete, it includes, among other things, the fine sermon about Paul on
                    the text ‘for when I am weak, then am I strong’. It’s a noble book, you’ll see
                    it at Christmas, I was so happy with it that until today I’ve been carrying it
                    around in my pocket,</good_health> though it’s time I stopped that because
                something might happen to it. From Mendes I received the works of Claudius, also a
                good, solid book; I had sent him Thomae Kempensis de imitatione Christi and written
                in the front, There is neither Jew nor Greek in Him, neither bond nor free, neither
                male nor female: but Christ is all, and in all. From Uncle Stricker a box of cigars,
                you know what I did with them, they’re always so friendly at the Rooses’ and I’d
                already been wondering if I had anything to send when that box of cigars arrived as
                a godsend. And in the evening I found a letter from Uncle Jan lying on my table. Was
                then briefly at Vos and Kee’s, where Uncle and Aunt Stricker were as well, but
                couldn’t stay because I had a lesson from 810 with Teixeira. Uncle Jan spent the
                evening at Uncle Cor’s.Was at Uncle Stricker’s service this morning, i.e. in the
                Eilandskerk, Uncle Cor was there too. The text was ‘by Thy light shall we see
                light’. It’s always a nice walk to that Eilandskerk. This afternoon I took another
                walk around the little English church with those maps of those rocky countries,
                because I had a feeling that they were connected with that little church. </p>
            <p> ‘The Church of God stands on a rock’, those words were in this morning’s hymn, and
                that’s how Ruisdael painted it too, and Millet in the painting in the Luxembourg. </p>
            <p> It’s a good plan of yours to write those names etc. on the map of Brittany. Bring it
                along at Christmas, you know that I did that on the one I drew, then we can compare
                them. Be sure and do it, for that is good. </p>
            <p> You talk about my coming to The Hague again on my way to Etten, I should really like
                to, would it be possible to stay a night at the Rooses’? If so, then you do not have
                to write, then I’ll count on it being possible if necessary. I should like to see
                your room again and the tree with ivy, I hope that will be possible and that I can
                leave here early enough. </p>
            <p> I can’t tell you how much I long for Christmas. And may Pa be satisfied with what
                I’ve done. </p>
            <p>
                <unstress reason="environment"> It was such wonderful weather today, and so
                    beautiful among those thornhedges by the little church when night began to
                    fall.</unstress>
            </p>
            <p> Had a talk with Mendes this week, or rather last week, about ‘He who hate not, even
                his own life also, he cannot be my disciple’. He declared that expression too
                strong, but I maintained that it was the simple truth, and doesn’t Thomas a Kempis
                say it when he talks about knowing oneself and despising oneself? </p>
            <p>
                <bad_health>If we look at others who have done more and are better than we are, then
                    soon enough we come to hate our own life because it’s not as good as that of
                    others.</bad_health> Just look at a man like Thomas a Kempis, constrained by the
                love of Christ to write that little book, sincere and simple and true as few others
                were, either before or since. Or in another sphere, just take a look at the work of
                a Millet or that of a Stieler or The large oaks by Jules Dupré. They did it: ‘let
                your light shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your
                Father which is in heaven’, and Pa is such a man too; and however much we can do,
                you see, the best thing is to keep our sights on such people and to seek whether we
                too may perhaps find something. And to believe that it’s true what Pa said, that if
                someone asks ‘Lord, I should so much like to be earnest’, that it will be heard and
                granted by God. </p>
            <p> Have a good Sunday today, how I’d like to be with you, Uncle Jan has gone to Haarlem
                so I’m alone this evening, but still have to do as much as I possibly can. You have
                really given me such pleasure with that magazine on E. Frère. I once saw him myself
                at Goupil’s, he has something very unpretentious about him. ‘At last, he triumphed’
                it says in his biography, may it be so with us one day — that can happen and it is
                good to say: I never despair. </p>
            <p> A person doesn’t get it all at once, and most of those who have become something
                very good have gone through a long, difficult period of preparation that was the
                rock upon which their house was founded. </p>
            <p> Man is depraved by nature, at best a thief — but — with God’s guidance and blessing
                he can become something of higher worth, as there came for Paul a day on which he
                could say with frankness and trust to Herod, I would to God, that not only thou, but
                also all that hear me this day, were such as I am, except these bonds. </p>
            <p> Thanks for what you write about the lithographs. Something else — <good_health>you
                    also sent 2 pairs of Christus Consolator and pendant, I was very glad to get
                    them.</good_health> It could do no harm if you also had that map of Scotland,
                then you would have three things from that atlas, and the proverb says: all good
                things come in threes. So count on getting that one too, and by no means buy it
                yourself, had first wanted to send you this one that is now going to Gladwell, but I
                consider it my duty to let him hear from me now and again. I hope he’ll be able to
                go to Lewisham at Christmas. You know that painting by Cuyp in the museum here, an
                old Dutch family, when he saw that he stood looking at it for a long time and then
                spoke of ‘the house built on the rock’ and of his home in Lewisham. I, too, have
                memories of his father’s house and will not easily forget it. Much and strong and
                great love lives there under that roof, and its fire is in him still, it is not
                dead, but sleepeth. </p>
            <p>
                <stress reason="career">Now I have to hurry, for I have to get to work.</stress> So
                in all likelihood I’ll be coming to The Hague next week for a day, Thursday say,
                possibly later, I have to see how it fits in best with my work. From The Hague I
                hope to go to Dordrecht, and if it turns out that you can leave Saturday evening,
                we’ll meet each other at the station in Dordrecht. </p>
            <p> In that case I would even spend two nights at the Rooses’, if I’m going to The Hague
                anyway, it can’t hurt to stay a bit longer and call on some people. </p>
            <p> A pity, in a way, that Mauve is going to move, I hope that we’ll go there again
                together, like that evening last spring, it was really pleasant then. </p>
            <p> Now make sure they don’t go to any trouble at the Rooses’. If I can’t stay there
                you’ll know it without asking them and can write to me, and I’ll take it into
                account; if I can, tell them only the day before. </p>
            <p> I wish you the very best and blessings in your work. You’ll be busy, but actually
                one should be grateful for pressure and effort and all suchlike things more than for
                anything else, for it is only by long training in that that one develops. I
                sincerely hope that you’ll be able to leave Saturday, because at home they’d surely
                like us to be in Etten the Sunday before Christmas. So goodbye for now, if I hear
                nothing more from you I’ll come on Thursday or Friday, 20 or 21 December. </p>
            <p> I finally decided to hang up that page again from Bargue’s Cours de dessin, Anne of
                Brittany, yes, man is depraved by nature and at best a thief, but in the battle of
                life he can become a being of higher worth; a being of higher worth, those words
                sprang to mind when I had been looking for a long time at the expression on the face
                of that beautiful woman Anne of Brittany, the expression which explains why she also
                recalls the words ‘one of Sorrows and acquainted with grief; sorrowful yet always
                rejoicing’. </p>
            <p>Adieu, give my regards to your housemates, and believe me</p>

        <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
        <body>
            <p> Thanks for your last letter, I heard from home that you’ve already been to Mauve’s,
                that was undoubtedly a good day, I’ll certainly hear about it sometime, when the
                opportunity arises. Herewith a contribution for your collection, namely three
                lithographs after Bosboom and two by J. Weissenbruch, found them this morning at a
                Jewish bookseller’s. Is that one after Bosboom the church in Scheveningen? The other
                is the Grote Kerk in Breda, the third after his painting that was at the large
                exhibition in Paris. <good_health>Those two after Weissenbruch moved
                    me</good_health> – perhaps you already have them, but then again possibly not.
                Do go on collecting such prints, and books too. </p>
            <p> I’m now collecting Latin and Greek themes and all kinds of writings on history and
                so on. <work origin="new" stage="middle">Am working on one on the Reformation that’s
                    getting rather long. </work></p>
            <p>
                <stress reason="career">Recently spoke to a young man who had just done his entrance
                    examination for the Leiden college with a good result – it isn’t easy, he told
                    me what they asked him, but I do keep up my courage, and with God’s help I’ll
                    pass them,</stress> and the following examinations as well. Mendes has given me
                every reason to believe that at the end of three months we’ll be as far as he
                imagined we would be if everything went well. Still, Greek lessons in the heart of
                Amsterdam, in the heart of the Jewish quarter on a very warm and oppressive summer
                afternoon, with the feeling hanging over me that many difficult examinations will
                have to be taken, set by very learned and cunning professors, are rather more
                oppressive than a walk on the beach or in the Brabant wheatfields, which will
                certainly be beautiful now, on a day like that. But we must ‘strive on’ through
                everything, as Uncle Jan says. </p>
            <p> A couple of days ago a couple of children fell into the water near the Kattenburg
                bridge. Uncle saw it and commandeered the sloop of the Makasser that is in dock
                here. A little boy was pulled out; I went along with two ship’s doctors whom Uncle
                had sent over, and the men carrying the boy into a chemist’s shop made every effort
                to resuscitate the child, but to no avail. In the meantime it was recognized by the
                father, who’s a stoker at the dockyard, and the little body was taken home in a
                woollen blanket. The search went on for an hour and a half, as it was thought that a
                girl had fallen in as well, though happily that seems not to be the case. In the
                evening I went back to see the people, it was then already dark in the house, the
                little body lay so still on a bed in a side room, he was such a sweet little boy.
                    <bad_health>There was great sorrow, that child was the light of that house, as
                    it were, and that light had now been put out. Even though coarse people express
                    their grief in a coarse way and without dignity, as the mother did, among
                    others, still, one feels a great deal in such a house of mourning, and the
                    impression stayed with me the whole evening when I took a walk.</bad_health>
            </p>
            <p>
                <unstress reason="environment">Last Sunday morning I made a nice excursion, namely
                    first to the early sermon, the Rev. Posthumus Meijjes in the Noorderkerk, then
                    to Bickerseiland, where I walked on the dyke along the IJ until it was time for
                    church again, and then to the Eilandskerk where Uncle Stricker
                    preached.</unstress> Thus the time passes, and quickly too, already we’re almost
                at the end of the week again.How are you, old chap? So very often, daily, do I think
                of you. </p>
            <p> God help us, struggling, to stay on top, it is good that you associate with good
                artists; I, too, still cling to the memory of many of them. Overcome evil with good,
                it is written, and one can seek to do it – and to this end God can help and make our
                days bearable with much good in the meantime, and preserve us from too much
                selfreproach. </p>
            <p> When Uncle Jan commandeered the sloop and the doctors to go and help on the
                afternoon that accident happened, I saw him in his element. </p>
            <p> Now I must get to work, though I still have to fill this page. Anna is in Leiden, as
                you surely know, and will come here one of these days with our future brotherinlaw,
                am looking forward to seeing them very much, Pa wrote so cheerfully about last
                Sunday when they were in Etten and everything was good in his eyes, and they see
                rightly, <good_health>so let us view what has happened to our sister as a blessing
                    on our house, in which we all share; if one member be glad, let all the members
                    be glad with her.</good_health>
            </p>
            <p> Next week, or perhaps even tomorrow, Uncle and Aunt Pompe are coming to stay here,
                and also Fanny and Bet ’s Graeuwen, it’s been a long time since I’ve seen any of
                them. </p>
            <p> Am quite often up rather early in the morning, and when the sun rises over the yard
                and the workers come a while later it’s a wonderful sight from the window, and I
                should wish to have you here. <work origin="new" stage="planned">Will I later be
                    working on such a morning on a sermon on ‘He maketh His sun to rise on the evil
                    and on the good’, or on ‘Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and
                    Christ shall give thee light’, or on ‘It is a good thing to praise the Lord in
                    the morning’ and ‘It is a pleasant thing for the eyes to behold the sun’</work>
                – I hope so. </p>
            <p> All the same, <unstress reason="environment">it seems that the sun never shines so
                    beautifully as it does in a parsonage or in a church. It’s wonderful to work on
                    ‘the writings’ early in the morning.</unstress>
            </p>
            <p>If you have the time and a stamp and paper, then write again soon. Uncle Jan sends
                you his regards, that evening you described there in the dunes must have been
                pleasant. <unstress reason="environment">In Uncle Cor’s shop I recently saw The
                    Gospels by Bida, how beautiful it is, </unstress>how wonderful it must be to be
                a Christian labourer like that, but it’s impossible to put into words how beautiful
                it is, that’s it again, there is much in that work that reminds one of Rembrandt.
                And now a handshake in thought, and I sincerely wish you the best, and believe me
                ever</p>

        <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
        <body>
            <p>Thanks for your last letter, which I was glad to get. Yes, old boy, that etching
                after Jules Goupil is beautiful and forms, with all that’s associated with it, a
                fine and good whole that is a thing to keep in one’s heart. I rather envy your
                having read Carlyle, ‘French Revolution’, it’s not unknown to me but didn’t read all
                of it, I found parts of it in another book, namely by Taine. </p>
            <p>
                <work origin="new" stage="middle">Am busy making an extract from Motley, including
                    capture of Den Briel and siege of Haarlem, Alkmaar and Leiden, have drawn a map
                    to go with it,</work> so as to complete it. <work origin="new" stage="finished"
                    >Have also finished an extract from Bunyan’s Pilgrim’s progress.</work>
                <stress reason="career">Am working all the time, day in, day out, so some things do
                    get done.</stress>
            </p>
            <p> I keep my work together, everything <stress reason="career">aimed at getting through
                    the exams</stress>, I consult Mendes on everything, and model my studies on what
                he has done, for that is how I’d like to do it too. That history of the 80 Years’
                War is really wonderful, anyone would do well to make such a good fight of his life.
                    <stress reason="career">Truly life is a fight, and one must defend oneself and
                    resist and make plans and calculations with a cheerful and alert mind in order
                    to make it through and get ahead. It becomes no easier the further one gets in
                    life</stress>, and it has been rightly said: </p>
            <p>Does the road go uphill then all the way? ‘Yes to the very end’ And will the journey
                take all day long? ‘From morn till night, my friend.’</p>
            <p><good_health>But by fighting the difficulties in which one finds oneself, an inner
                    strength develops from within our heart,</good_health> which improves in life’s
                fight (one matures in the storm), if we always endeavour to keep that heart out of
                which are the issues of life, good and simple and rich toward God, to restore that
                and make it thus more and more, and to bear in mind the words that we must have a
                good conscience before God and before people. </p>
            <p> As we regard others so are we regarded by many eyes. It is from the conscience —
                God’s finest gift, and the proof that His eye is upon us, allseeing and allknowing,
                and also the assurance that He be not far from every one of us, but as our shade
                upon our right hand, and that He keeps us from the evil — that our light comes in
                the darkness of life and of the world. And if we feel an eye watching us, as it
                were, then it is good to gaze upward sometimes as though seeing Him who is
                invisible.I know that life of Frederick the Great illustrated by Menzel, that’s a
                good acquisition, do go on with that collection; I also know that woodcut after
                Jacque, The sheepfold, do bring those things home with you at Christmas. </p>
            <p> Have bought from the Jew that lithograph after L. Steffens of which you once showed
                me the painting, an old and a young priest conversing in a garden, it’s a good
                lithograph. The scene reminds me of a painting by Jacquand, photographed in the
                cartes de visite, it’s called ‘The new vicar’, I believe, it has the same sentiment,
                and also of The novice by G. Doré. </p>
            <p>
                <stress reason="career">Old boy, Latin and Greek and studying are
                difficult</stress>, but a<good_health>ll the same I feel very happy with it and am
                    doing the things I have longed for.</good_health> I’m no longer allowed to sit
                up late in the evenings, Uncle has very strictly forbidden it — yet the words
                written below the etching by Rembrandt stick in my mind, In medio noctis vim suam
                lux exerit (In the middle of the night the light diffuses its strength) and I make
                sure that a small gaslight goes on burning the whole night, and lie looking at it
                often in medio noctis, <good_health>thinking about my plan for work the following
                    day and considering how to go about that studying as well as
                    possible.</good_health> Hope in the winter to light the fire early in the
                morning (and while obeying Uncle yet letting the light shine in the night and
                darkness once in a while). The winter mornings have something special about them,
                Frère painted that in that workman, ‘A cooper’ (the etching is hanging in your room,
                I believe), among other things. </p>
            <p> Fill my soul with a holy bitterness that shall be agreeable to Thee, and I shall
                humbly spend all the years of my life in Thy service, in the bitterness of my soul,
                yea, even in Thy Service, O Man of sorrows and acquainted with grief. That is
                certainly a good prayer, and I thought of it when I told you in simplicity that it
                was good to steep oneself in coffee in everyday life. </p>
            <p> A person has needs, and requires strength and fortification to be able to work. And
                one must make do with what one has and fight with such weapons as are within one’s
                reach, and use the means at one’s disposal to make the most of it and gain from it. </p>
            <p> (You can see from my handwriting that it had grown dark, but now the lamp is on.)
                Ate hotchpot at Uncle Stricker’s one afternoon, and it occurred to me on that
                occasion to make that extract from Motley, I’ll show it to you at Christmas. Because
                here in town I’ve seen and walked over so awfully many doorsteps and church floors
                and flights of steps up to houses, it occurred to me to make those maps of rocky
                Scotland, and while colouring them in (green and red) I thought of those pickles
                that Uncle is so fond of and I’ve grown fond of too. A person’s soul is a singularly
                strange thing, and it is good, I think, to have one like a map of England made with
                love and to have in it as much as possible of that love which is holy and beareth
                all things and believeth all things and hopeth all things and endureth all things
                and never faileth.<good_health> That Love is the Light of the world, the true life
                    that is the light of men. The knowledge of languages is certainly a good thing
                    to have, and I follow after in the hope that I might also grasp something of
                    it.</good_health>
            </p>
            <p> When one eats a crust of black rye bread it’s certainly good to think of the words
                ‘Tunc justi fulgebunt ut sol in regnum Patris sui’ (Then shall the righteous shine
                forth as the Sun in the Kingdom of their Father), or also when one very often has
                muddy boots or wet, dirty clothes. May we all at sometime enter into that kingdom
                which is not of this world, where they do not marry and are not given in marriage,
                where the sun shall be no more thy light by day, neither for brightness shall the
                moon give light unto thee, but the Lord shall be an Everlasting Light, and God our
                glory, where the sun shall no more go down, neither shall the moon withdraw itself,
                for the Lord shall be thine Everlasting Light, and the days of mourning shall be
                ended and God shall wipe away all tears from the eyes. And so we can be leavened
                with the leaven of ‘sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing’, being what we are through God’s
                grace, having in the secret recesses of the heart the words ‘I never despair’
                because we have faith in God. And then ‘Set your face as a flint’ are really good
                words in many circumstances, and also ‘be like an iron pillar or like an old oak
                tree’. It’s also good to love thorns, such as the thornhedges around the little
                English church or the roses in the cemetery, they’re so beautiful these days, yes,
                if one could make oneself a crown of the thorns of life, not for the people but with
                which one is seen by God, then one would do well. </p>
            <p> I imagine you know the woodcuts by Swain, he’s a clever man, his studio is in such a
                nice part of London, not far from that part of the Strand where the offices of the
                illustrated magazines are (Ill. Lond. News, The Graphic, Seeley), not far from
                Booksellers’ Row either, full of all kinds of bookstalls and shops where one sees
                all kinds of things, from the etchings of Rembrandt to the Household edition of
                Dickens and Chandos classics, everything there has a green cast (especially in foggy
                weather in the autumn, or during the dark days before Christmas), and it’s a place
                that immediately reminds one of Ephesus, as it is described with such singular
                simplicity in Acts. (Similarly, the bookshops in Paris are also so interesting, in
                the Faubourg St Germain, for instance.) </p>
            <p>
                <stress reason="career">Old boy, how inexpressibly happy I’ll be if I manage to pass
                    my exams, if I conquer the difficulties it will be done in singleness of
                    heart,</stress> but also with prayer to God, for I so often pray fervently to
                Him for the wisdom I’m in need of, and that He may one day grant that I write and
                deliver many sermons, the more like our Father’s the better, and to complete a Work
                in my life to which end all things work together for good. </p>
            <p> I was at Uncle Cor’s on Monday evening, and also saw Aunt and the whole family, all
                send you their warm regards. Stayed rather a long time because I hadn’t seen Aunt
                for a long time and one offends so easily without meaning to by giving the
                impression of not appreciating and of neglecting people. Looked through that book at
                Uncle’s, the engraved oeuvre of C. Daubigny. Went from there to Uncle Stricker’s,
                Uncle was out but a son of the Rev. Meyboom was visiting (brother of Margreet), an
                officer in the Navy, and his girlfriend and a young man, Middelbeek, who has been in
                London for a while and is going back there.At 10 o’clock Uncle came home soaking
                wet, for it was raining quite a lot that evening, and I had a long talk with him and
                Aunt, because Mendes had paid them a visit a couple of days ago (one shouldn’t utter
                the word genius lightly, even if one believes that there is more of it in the world
                than many people think, but Mendes certainly is a very remarkable person, and I’m
                happy and grateful for my contact with him) and hadn’t given them a bad report,
                fortunately, but <stress reason="career">Uncle asked me if it wasn’t difficult, and
                    I admitted that it was very difficult and that I was doing my best to bear up
                    and to be alert in all kinds of ways.</stress> He gave me encouragement,
                however. But now there’s still that terrible algebra and geometry, anyway, we’ll see
                — after Christmas I have to have lessons in those as well, there’s nothing for it. </p>
            <p> I also cling to the church and to the bookshops, if I can think of an errand to do
                there I do it. Today, for instance, I was at Schalekamp’s and at C.L. Brinkman’s in
                Hartestraat (that shop of Schalekamp’s is an interesting sight) and bought a couple
                of maps from the Teachers’ Society, of which there are around 100 at a stuiver
                apiece, including the Netherlands in every possible historical period. (So often, in
                the past as well, a visit to a bookshop has cheered me up and reminded me that there
                are good things in the world.) </p>
            <p>
                <unstress reason="environment">Sunday morning I went to the early service and
                    afterwards to the French church, where I heard an outstanding sermon from the
                    Rev. Gagnebin</unstress>: the house at Bethany. ‘One thing is needful and Mary
                hath chosen that good part’. That Rev. Gagnebin has a pleasant appearance and a
                worthy head, and his face has something of the Peace of God which passeth all
                understanding. He does have something, I think, either of that priest in The last
                victims of the terror or of that humble and faithful manservant one sees in ‘The
                women of the boardinghouse’. </p>
            <p> That painting by Israëls you describe must be beautiful, I can picture it from your
                clear description. Saw a small painting of his at C.M.’s, also one by Mauve, very
                beautiful, shepherd with flock of sheep in the dunes. </p>
            <p> A good cheerful letter from home too, fortunately things seem to be going better in
                Princenhage. I’m longing not a little for Christmas, do bring one thing and another
                with you, as much as possible, it’s good for all of us. Don’t be in a hurry to send
                the tobacco; still have some, it’s a good and necessary aid to study. </p>
            <p> Wrote a long letter to Harry Gladwell that went off today, also sent your regards.
                If you have the time and the opportunity, think of Michelet, you know what, and J.
                Breton, but you know what it’s for and that there’s no hurry, and if necessary
                Christmas is soon enough. Now, I must get to work and the sheet of paper is nearly
                full, I wish you well, write if possible, I gave Uncle the receipt enclosed in your
                letter. Uncle sends you his regards, also Uncle and Aunt Stricker. Bid your
                housemates goodday from me, and should the opportunity arise also Mauve and his wife
                and the Tersteegs and Van Stockums (how is she?) and Haanebeeks, and Borchers if you
                run into him. Blessings on everything you do, I wish you strength and vigour in
                these autumn days, and let it be Christmas again with us together again before we
                know it, as it were, adieu, a handshake in thought, and believe me ever </p>

            <p>Saw 2 photos of Gabriel Max, the raising of Jairus’ daughter and a nun in a convent
                garden, the first one, in particular, was beautiful.Do you know an engraving after
                Landseer? It’s called The highlander, I believe, a highlander in a snowstorm on top

        <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
        <body>
            <p> It’s already late and everyone is already asleep, but I feel the need to write a few
                words to you again. You must persevere – you must go onward – as I must, too – we’re
                going through the same ordeal in many respects. </p>
            <p> In your last letter you write that you were thinking about moving elsewhere if
                possible, and you mention London and Paris. </p>
            <p> That might be good – oh, old boy, <good_health>how deeply I love those cities,
                    that’s to say I love much of what one meets with there,</good_health>
                <bad_health>there’s also much that I hate</bad_health> – or at least don’t love as
                much as the hedges of thornbush and the green grass and the little grey churches.
                What you’re thinking of is not bad at all. </p>
            <p> Be aware, though – we must both make sure that we survive the time between now and
                the age of 30 or so – and we must beware of sin – after all, we’re in the midst of
                life – well then, we must fight a good fight – and we must become men – which we
                aren’t yet, neither of us – there is something greater in store for us, my
                conscience tells me so, we are not what others are – well then, but we can endeavour
                to become so. You know what I want. <stress reason="career">If I may become a
                    clergyman, if I fulfil that position so that my work is equal to that of our
                    Father, then I shall thank God. </stress><good_health>I have good hope that I
                    shall succeed</good_health>, it was once said to me by someone who was further
                on in life than I, and who was no stranger in Jerusalem – I mean someone who had
                sought it himself and had also found it; it was once said to me: I believe that you
                are a Christian, you see, it was so good for me to hear those words. You too hold
                fast, no matter what you wish for yourself, to the thought of Christ and keep His
                saying, as you do. It is good to believe that there is a God who knows what we need,
                better than we know it ourselves, and who helps us when we need help. It is also
                good to believe that, just as in the olden days, now, too, an angel is not far from
                those who feel godly sorrow – not only from those who are almost angels themselves,
                but especially those who need help from a higher power to keep them from evil, from
                the evil that we know is in the world and not far from us, not far from those who
                have a broken heart and a contrite spirit. <bad_health>I’ve carefully read the story
                    of Elijah so often, and so often has it given me strength up to
                    now:</bad_health>And when he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and came
                to Beersheba, which belongeth to Judah, and left his servant there. But he himself
                went a day’s journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper
                tree: and he requested for himself that he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O
                Lord, take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers. And as he lay and
                slept under a juniper tree, behold, then an Angel touched him, and said unto him,
                Arise and eat. And he looked, and, behold, there was a cake baken on the coals, and
                a cruse of water at his head. And he did eat and drink, and laid him down again. And
                the Angel of the Lord came again the second time, and touched him, and said, Arise
                and eat; because the journey is too great for thee. And he arose, and did eat and
                drink, and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb
                the mount of God. And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and, behold,
                the word of the Lord came to him, and he said unto him, What doest thou here,
                Elijah? And he said, I have been very jealous for the Lord God of hosts: for the
                children of Israel have forsaken Thy covenant, thrown down Thine altars, and slain
                Thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to
                take it away. And He said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the Lord. And,
                behold, the Lord passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and
                brake in pieces the rocks before the Lord; but the Lord was not in the wind: and
                after the wind an earthquake; but the Lord was not in the earthquake: and after the
                earthquake a fire; but the Lord was not in the fire: and after the fire a still
                small voice. And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his
                mantle, and went out, and stood in the entering in of the cave. And, behold, there
                came a voice unto him, and said, What doest thou here, Elijah? And he said, I have
                been very jealous for the Lord God of hosts. And the Lord said unto him, ‘Go, return
                on thy way’.And that story does not stand alone, we read of the Angel who
                strengthened Him in Gethsemane, who was sorrowful, even unto death, of the Angel who
                woke Peter from his sleep in prison, of the Angel who appeared to Paul in the night
                and said ‘Fear not’. And we, although we saw no Angel, although we are not the same
                as those men of old, should we not know that there is strengthening from Above? </p>
            <p> This afternoon it was stormy and rained here, and I walked to the sea past the
                Jewish cemetery, a few days ago I also went for a walk there on Buitenkant near the
                Oosterspoor, where they’re working on the sand works. What a beautiful and
                heartening story that is too, the one about Jesus walking on the sea, Matthew
                XIV:2233, And straightway Jesus constrained His disciples to get into a ship, and to
                go before Him unto the other side, while He sent the multitudes away. And when He
                had sent the multitudes away, He went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the
                evening was come, He was there alone. But the ship was now in the midst of the sea,
                tossed with waves: for the wind was contrary. And in the fourth watch of the night
                Jesus went unto them, walking on the sea. And when the disciples saw Him walking on
                the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear.
                But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer; it is I; be not
                afraid. And Peter answered Him and said, Lord, if it be Thou, bid me come unto Thee
                on the water. And He said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he
                walked on the water, to go to Jesus. But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was
                afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me. And immediately
                Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little
                faith, wherefore didst thou doubt? And when they were come into the ship, the wind
                ceased. Believe in God, through faith one can become ‘sorrowful, yet alway
                rejoicing’ and evergreen and we need not complain ‘if our youth disappears at the
                maturing of our powers’. </p>
            <p>Herewith something by Esquiros, I wish you the very best, write again soon, give my
                regards to your housemates and any acquaintances you might see, and accept in
                thought a hearty handshake, and believe me</p>

                <good_health>It felt wonderful to hear Gladwell’s voice in the hall as I sat
                    upstairs studying and to see him a moment later and to shake his
                    hand</good_health>.<unstress reason="environment"> Yesterday we took a nice walk
                    through the main streets and past most of the churches</unstress>, and got up
                this morning before 5 to see the people coming to the dockyard and afterwards walked
                to Zeeburg and also saw a cemetery and went to the Trippenhuis (twice) and he alone
                to Van der Hoop, and he was also at Uncle Cor’s gallery (who isn’t in town, however)
                and with Mendes in the room. Now we also have plans to go to Uncle Stricker’s
                (because I’ve been invited to eat there today and will simply risk it and take him
                along), and if we have time also to see Vos and Kee. And I would also like very much
                to go with him to Bickerseiland, but perhaps there won’t be time. Have also strongly
                suggested that he go to Haarlem to see the paintings by Frans Hals, and now he’s
                going there and not to Antwerp as he had planned, but will save Belgium for later
                and is concentrating now exclusively on Holland. </p>
            <p> We also spent a lot of time in the little study and talked of things new and old. </p>
            <p>
                <unstress reason="friendship">When he’s sitting beside me I again feel the same
                    feeling that drew me to him so often, as though he were a son of the same family
                    and a brother in faith because he loves ‘the man of sorrows and acquainted with
                    grief’.</unstress> Who is our God and in Whose teachings and resurrection we
                believe, Whose spirit we seek, of Whose love we ask that it constrain us in life and
                that nothing separate us from it, nor things present, nor things to come. In him,
                too, godly sorrow shall work that which in many it has worked and works and shall
                work, a choice not to be repented of, for that good part which shall not be taken
                away, and choosing the only thing necessary and worthy of bringing forth fruits meet
                for repentance. He is a Christian and will become one more and more. <unstress
                    reason="friendship">This morning we read together the story of Elijah by the
                    brook Cherith</unstress> and at the widow’s – because when we lived together in
                Montmartre we found that the barrel of meal did not waste and the cruse of water did
                not fail – and yesterday evening the parable of the sower and others. Now he’ll stay
                with you for a while as well, and is longing to see your little room and what you
                have in the way of prints. </p>
            <p> Received from him Bunyan, The pilgrim’s progress, that is an asset, as is Bossuet,
                Oraison funèbres, which I recently bought very cheaply, and The imitation by T. a
                Kempis in Latin, which I got from Vos and which I hope to be able to read in Latin
                some day.He read here various bits of Bungener, Esquiros, Lamennais, Souvestre,
                Lamartine (Cromwell), and took pleasure in the lithographs after Bosboom, we bought
                one from a Jew, and he gave me instructions to buy some more for him when the
                opportunity presents itself. </p>
            <p> I sincerely hope that you’ll have a pleasant evening with him, and I believe that
                the more you seek in him the more you will find in him. </p>
            <p> We talked about this and that, and what we said to each other is this: many, having
                come to a point in life where one must make a choice about life, have chosen for
                their part ‘the love of Christ and poverty’, or rather ‘give me neither poverty nor
                riches, feed me with bread convenient for me’. <unstress reason="friendship">The
                    time together flew past for me, and I wished we could have stayed together a
                    little longer; </unstress>but it cannot be, and everyone must return to his way
                and continue to do whatsoever the hand findeth to do in the calling wherein he was
                called, and <good_health>I for my part am thankful from the bottom of my heart that
                    I was able to see him again</good_health>, and found in him that which drew me
                to him. He told me that you will certainly make the trip with the nouveautés,
                probably in about 4 weeks’ time, so I also hope to see you again then. </p>
            <p> I sincerely hope that he’ll have pleasant and good memories of his visit to Holland,
                it’s courageous of him to have persisted with that plan. </p>
            <p>Give my regards to your housemates, have a good evening with him; should wish for you
                to be attached to him as I feel attached to him at the moment, and accept in thought

        <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
        <body>
            <p>I just received your letter and the 250 francs enclosed. If I may regard your letter
                as a reply to my proposal, I would certainly be able to accept what you say. For my
                part I simply wish — in order to avoid correspondence, dispute — in order to be able
                to say something when one is railed at in daily life by one person or another as
                being ‘without means of support’ — that if I continue to receive the usual from you,
                I may regard it as money that I’ve earned. Naturally I’ll send you work every month.
                That work, as you say, is then your property — and I completely agree with you that
                in that case you have every right to do nothing with it — indeed, I wouldn’t even be
                in a position to object if you thought fit to tear it up.</p>
            <p>
                <stress reason="money">I for my part, needing money, am obliged to accept it even if
                    someone says to me ‘I don’t want to do anything with this drawing of yours or
                    burn it, you can have this much for it’ — in the circumstances I’d say — very
                    well — give me the money — here you have my work — I want to get on — in order
                    to get on I must have money — I’m seeing to it that I get it — and so — if need
                    be, even if I really didn’t give a damn about you, as long as I receive money
                    from you each month that is useful and necessary to me (without conditions that
                    I may not do this, that or the other), I won’t break the ties, and if need be
                    I’ll put up with anything.</stress>
            </p>
            <p>This way of mine of regarding you and your money balances your way of regarding me
                and my work — and as long as it remains in balance — I’ll accept it.</p>
            <p><stress reason="friendship">If I receive money from you, you drawings or paintings
                    from me — and I have something to justify myself in the view of society and we
                    otherwise have nothing in common with each other, if need be — don’t write or
                    talk about anything — even then it’s enough for me for the moment and I accept
                    it completely. Even if it pleases you to tear my work up or if you want to do
                    nothing with it, or if you want to do something with it, I no longer have the
                    right to criticize as soon as, for my part, I may regard it as a purchase.
                </stress>Be so good as to tell me which term of abuse I used about your friend Braat
                in my letter.</p>
            <p>In my letter, as far as I know, there was nothing about Braat except that I thought
                he was already ill in the months that I knew him at Cie in Paris. At that time, as
                far as I can recall, I got on very well with him, and I really don’t understand how
                you get the idea that I ‘can’t stand’ him. So many years have passed, so much has
                changed for me in those years, that the people I knew then are fairly vague and
                indistinct in my memory and — that I seldom if ever think about them — which nobody
                can blame me for, I believe. But as to Braat, far from my not wanting to take any
                special notice of him, now that you’ve written about it that way, will you please
                assure him that my sympathies are with him, as they would be with any sufferer, and
                that, if he happens to remember me, I send my regards and wish him as much peace and
                serenity as one may have in such a situation. Yet what good does such a wish do him
                — not much — so, unless one is called upon to say something, one keeps such things
                to oneself. I would ask you though, if you’ve said something to him about my having
                written about him in the way you reproach me with, to tell him that you had only
                seen that term of abuse in your imagination. For you definitely won’t find it in my
                letter.</p>
            <p>You write that you had tried to answer my letters, but had left off. For my part,
                too, I had wanted to write to you since then, but also left off.</p>
            <p>Know that if you don’t want to do anything with the work you buy from me, or tear it
                up if need be, this will be no reason for me not to do my best in it.</p>
            <p><work origin="new" stage="finished">For this month I have some pen drawings for you;
                    in the first place the ones that are with Rappard at the moment — about which I
                    have a letter from him that he thought they were all beautiful, and the
                    sentiment in Behind the hedgerows and the Kingfisher particularly
                    beautiful.</work>
                <work stage="finished" origin="new">Then those first 3 Winter gardens too, which he
                    was also taken with. </work>Aside from those, <work origin="new"
                    stage="finished">I have some painted studies that are your property</work> — to
                do with just as you will — which I can send you if you wish — which, if you yourself
                don’t care to have them, I would ask you if I might keep for a while so as to work
                from them.</p>
            <p><work stage="finished" origin="new">One is a large weaver who is weaving a piece of
                    red cloth — the little church amidst the wheat — a view of a little old village
                    near here.</work>I’d just like to come back to your letter about my drawings —
                the one you say I’ve interpreted utterly impossibly.</p>
            <p>I see in it first that, among the things you say, there are a few whose tenor is that
                there were things that pleased you in the tone, in the sentiment — so much the
                better — if you will, that gives me a good deal of pleasure.</p>
            <p>Second, in that letter there’s a comparison of the schools of Millet and Lhermitte. I
                found what you said about Millet better and more sensitive expressions than I am
                used to from you — this was overshadowed, however, by the way you were again tired
                of Lhermitte, and I’d also like to say about your whole argument once again, you’re
                splitting your hairs too thin — why didn’t you take a broader view, why didn’t you
                feel the same enthusiasm for both (who to my mind are to each other as Rembrandt is
                to Maes, say) without immersing yourself in barren hairsplitting about who is the
                greater? Third, there was something that was not in that letter, namely an answer to
                the question as to whether we’d go on or not.</p>
            <p>That was the question that it was all about, and since my work depends on my paint
                and tools (to an extent that I can’t ignore), and they in turn on whether or not I
                receive money, I can’t possibly ascribe much usefulness to that letter.</p>
            <p><stress reason="money">It would be less impossible for me to preserve my composure in
                    our correspondence if, when you don’t have the money on the date, you were to
                    write, I haven’t got it, you’ll get it at such and such a time. Now you wrote
                    not a word in response to my saying: it surprises me that I hear nothing, my
                    having said I’d rather have it at once than later, because you said that if I
                    need it I can get the money by return. If you’d written again then, I’m sorry
                    but I haven’t got it, I shouldn’t have had to get ideas into my head that you’re
                    deliberately being lax in order to make my life a bit more difficult.</stress>
                And — when you haven’t got it, I can’t take it amiss — when you ignore —
                deliberately or not deliberately — that’s something that I really wish you could
                cure yourself of, and something about which one really has to get angry. What I said
                about doing something with my work, in Antwerp, for instance, definitely is my plan.
                    <stress reason="money">The frame of mind in which you now are about me, the
                    frame of mind in which I now am about you, is cool enough simply to ask and to
                    reply coolly. After all — leaving aside — giving a damn about each other or not
                    — can I count on its being fixed for 1 year that I’ll continue to receive the
                    usual monthly in return for supplying my work? Why I have to know this is
                    because, if I can count on it, I would take a slightly roomier studio somewhere,
                    which I need in order to be able to work with a model.</stress></p>
            <p>The one I have at present has the following geographical location,and my powers of
                imagination aren’t strong enough to think this an improvement on the situation last
                year. This doesn’t alter the fact that, if I complain about something, there appear
                in your letters such passages as: I (Theo) think that your position is better now
                than last summer. Really? And I also draw the little map in response to your
                expression ‘I’m not aware’, and I would also not be content with this letter of
                yours if that wasn’t in it. To which I say — I don’t care whether or not you’re
                aware that this or that isn’t quite in order, as long as you just don’t ask me to
                walk round befuddled about it, and as long as you give me the means to improve
                things I have no objection to your being ‘aware’ of all sorts of things.</p>
            <p>I hope this letter is as cool as yours — and I thank you very much for what you sent
                — which makes up for the rest — at least makes it such that, if I could count on its
                continuing thus for a year, I ask nothing more of you and will right gladly send you
                my work.</p>
            <p>And would just suggest one other small thing to you: that if I can sell something in
                Antwerp or somewhere, I notify you of it, and it’s deducted from the 150 francs.</p>
            <p>I don’t write to Rappard about business matters — at least I haven’t told him that
                latterly I haven’t been on terms with you as in the past. Just think about whether
                it’s quite in order that you, who know Rappard, have never seen anything of his
                work, have absolutely no idea what he’s doing — no longer take any notice whatsoever
                of him, except perhaps by hearsay from me. Yet he’s one of the people who will
                amount to something — with whom people will have to reckon — of whose work people
                will have to take notice. At the time Rappard came to you and felt small in your
                presence, you who knew so much about art. Since that year he was in Paris — how
                immensely he has progressed — but you — haven’t you rested on your laurels a
                bit???</p>

        <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
        <body>
            <p>
                <unstress reason="money">Thanks for your letter and the enclosure, which is exactly
                    what I meant and enables me to work at the end of the month just as at the
                    beginning of the month.</unstress>
            </p>
            <p>I was very pleased to hear that Serret is the painter about whom you had previously
                written things that I had really remembered, but the name had escaped me. I’d like
                to write much more to you than I will in this letter, but when I get home nowadays
                I’m really not in the mood for writing when I’ve been sitting in the sun all day. As
                to what Serret says, I think so too — I’ll drop him a line, because I’d like to
                become friends with him. <work origin="new" stage="middle">As I already told you,
                    these days I’m hard at work on figure drawings —</work> I’ll send them
                specifically with an eye to Serret, to show him that I’m far from indifferent to the
                unity of a figure and the form.</p>
            <p>
                <stress reason="friendship">Do you ever see Wallis? Might the watercolour of the
                    auction be something for him? If it were something for Wisselingh, then better
                    he should take it. I once gave Wisselingh a couple of heads and also just sent
                    him the lithograph. But because he didn’t send so much as a word in reply, I
                    think that all I’d get would be an insult if I sent something.It just happened
                    to me that, having not heard anything from him in 3 months or so, I suddenly got
                    a letter from Rappard, with whom I’ve been on good terms for years, so
                    supercilious and so full of insults and, it seemed to me, so obviously written
                    after he’d been in The Hague that I’m as good as certain that I’ve lost him as a
                    friend for good.</stress>
            </p>
            <p>It’s precisely because I tried it first in The Hague, that’s to say my own country,
                that I have every right and reason to forget all that unpleasantness and to think of
                something else outside my own country.</p>
            <p>You know Wallis well, so perhaps you could bring it up sometime apropos of that
                watercolour, but act as the opportunity arises. <stress reason="money">If I could
                    earn something with my work, if we had some firm ground, even a little — under
                    our feet, to be able to go on living — and if ever the desire to become an
                    artisan took shape in you — let me say to make it clear — in the manner of, say,
                    discounting all the differences in age (and);c. — Hennebeau in Germinal — what
                    you would be able to paint then!</stress> Still, the future’s always other than
                one thinks, so one can never know for sure. <stress reason="career">The drawback to
                    painting is that if one doesn’t sell one’s paintings one still has to have money
                    for paints and models to make progress. And that drawback is ugly.</stress>
                <unstress reason="career"> But otherwise — painting and, to my mind, particularly
                    painting peasant life, gives peace of mind,</unstress> even though one has a lot
                of scraping along and wretchedness on the outside of life. I mean painting is a
                home, and one doesn’t have that homesickness, that peculiar thing that Hennebeau
                had.</p>
            <p>The passage I copied out then struck me very much because, almost literally at that
                time, I had just such a longing to be something like a grassmower or polder
                    worker.<good_health>And I was sick of the boredom of civilization. It is better,
                    one is happier if one puts it into effect — but pretty much literally — at least
                    one feels really alive. </good_health>And it is something to be deep in the snow
                in winter, to be deep in the yellow leaves in the autumn, to be deep in the ripe
                wheat in the summer, to be deep in the grass in the spring. It is something to
                always be with the mowers and the peasant girls, in summer with the big sky above,
                in the winter by the black fireplace. And to feel – this has always been so and
                always will be. One may sleep on straw, eat rye bread — well then, in the long run
                one is the healthier for it.</p>
            <p>I’d like to write more but — as I said — I’m not really in the mood for writing, and
                I wanted to enclose a note for Serret, which you must just read, since I write in it
                about what I wanted to send before long, especially because I want to let Serret see
                my particular figure studies. Regards,</p>
        </body>
        <close>Yours truly, </close>
        <sig>Vincent</sig>
        <ps>
            <p>Serret may agree with you that making good things and selling are quite separate. But
                there’s no truth in that. When the public saw Millet at last, his work collected
                together — then the public in both Paris and London was enthusiastic. And who was it
                who had stood in the way and rejected Millet? — the dealers — the socalled experts
                (and);c. I ask you, would a Mouret have said something like that, to keep talking
                about business?</p>

        <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
        <body>
            <p>
                <stress reason="money">You’ll certainly be interested in how things stand with the
                    call to Helvoirt that Pa received. Pa told the people in Helvoirt that he
                    certainly couldn’t even consider it unless the H. stipend was brought up to the
                    level of the Nuenen stipend. And Pa writes today that they don’t seem to be
                    raising any objections to making up the difference in stipend — they have to add
                    150 guilders to it, I believe. So although nothing has been decided — given the
                    willingness of the good natives of Helvoirt — there’s a real chance that as a
                    result of his own words Pa will have to consider it very seriously. This is
                    important to me, because I would certainly not want to go to Helvoirt with them.
                    I just wanted to tell you exactly how things stand.</stress>
            </p>
            <p>These last few days, although it’s freezing quite hard here, <work origin="new"
                    stage="middle">I’ve been working outdoors on a rather large study (more than 1
                    metre) of an old water mill in Gennep, on the other side of Eindhoven. I want to
                    finish the whole thing outdoors — but it will definitely be the last that I
                    paint outdoors this year.</work> Since I wrote to you <work stage="middle"
                    origin="new">I’ve also been working on other studies — among them two heads of
                    polder workers.</work></p>
            <p>
                <good_health>I now have 3 people in Eindhoven who want to learn to paint and whom
                    I’m teaching to paint still lifes. I can safely say that I’ve progressed in
                    painting technique and in colour since your visit. And that this will continue
                    to improve, too.</good_health>
            </p>
            <p><good_health>In painting, it’s the first steps that count — it gets easier later, and
                    I have some trumps in my hand. </good_health>And I think there are tricks to be
                taken with them. Now you know that I made an approach to Mauve and Tersteeg again,
                to put right what happened in the past.</p>
            <p>I don’t regret that approach.</p>
            <p>But they’ve refused to have anything to do with it — ‘very definitely’ refused. This
                doesn’t discourage me.</p>
            <p>I regard it as something like sending a painting to an exhibition and having it
                rejected.</p>
            <p>One has to encounter opposition at first, or even several times.</p>
            <p>So again, I don’t regret my approach, and shall most likely repeat it — not
                straightaway, exactly — but before too long. I wanted to tell you now that I’d be
                very pleased if you didn’t just stay neutral in this matter — but on the contrary
                helped me to get what I want. I’ve admitted I was wrong, not just to Mauve but to T.
                as well.</p>
            <p>All the more because I believe that later on they themselves will realize that for
                their part they totally misunderstood things.</p>
            <p>Which they don’t see yet.</p>
            <p>So for my part, by going so far this time as to very generously and decidedly admit I
                was wrong in the past, moreover to simply show them work as it gets better, <stress
                    reason="environment">in any event I won’t have to make any more apologies in
                    future. Once is enough, and I didn’t necessarily even have to go as far as I
                    did, namely — unconditionally. Getting them to be generous for their part — is
                    another thing – you could assist in this if you want to.</stress> If not — don’t
                bother about it, but then after a while I’ll return to it again on my own. I don’t
                know how you’ll have taken my last letter — which wasn’t meant angrily. My affairs
                can prosper, and in both our interests I wish that we could concentrate the strength
                we have at our disposal. I’ve replied briefly to both Tersteeg and M. about their
                refusal, to tell them that ‘I rather agree with Tersteeg that it would be better for
                me to seek out new people than to try to renew old relationships, that this really
                is my own idea, too, but above and beyond that, that I nonetheless have enough faith
                in the future that I will not lightly give up regaining even old relationships, even
                better than before’. This has been my answer to T. And is also what I tell you — I
                believe that it’s possible — to get on better terms than the present ones — with
                you, too.</p>
            <p>But — speaking bluntly — I think that you’ve been too neutral towards me the last 1
                1/2 or two years, and I wish above all for more warmth, and the friendship was too
                cool and not animated enough for me.</p>
            <p>Find this pedantic of me if you will — yet it isn’t pedantic but it’s for sound
                practical reasons that I pointed this out to you before and point it out
                    again.<stress reason="love">Margot Begemann is coming back to Nuenen one of
                    these days — I’ve always remained good friends with her, and it’s on my advice
                    that she did not give in to her sisters, who let it be seen that they’d rather
                    she stayed away and who keep telling her that in their view she has made a hash
                    of things. On the contrary, her family has obligations towards her, and in the
                    past she put her own money into the business when her brother went bankrupt.The
                    issue here is that if she and I choose to love each other, be attached to each
                    other — indeed have been for a long time — this is no wrongdoing on our part nor
                    something for which people may blame us. Either her or me. And in my view it’s
                    absurd that people felt they should get worked up about it — and then — in their
                    opinion — in my interest or in hers. That was a bad turn.</stress></p>
            <p>Anyone may do this with the best intentions — yet — — — Louis Begemann — he had his
                objections, too, but was such and remained such that both she and I could talk to
                him, and it was precisely because he was humane and calm that it didn’t turn out
                much worse, and when that happened with her, which only I knew about, he could help
                and all the others only hindered. And we were in complete agreement about the steps
                to be taken then.</p>
            <p>Three days before, after all, I had already warned him and said, I’m concerned about
                your sister.</p>
            <p>Most certainly, at some time she has done greater or lesser good turns for pretty
                well all the people here in the neighbourhood, either in sickness or when they were
                in some trouble or other. And she and I actually became attached during Ma’s
                illness.</p>
            <p>She has just written to me: should there be any people sick in Nuenen, do go and
                visit them and see if anything can be done to help. Well, there are a thousand
                things of that nature in her.</p>
            <p>And to put it very mildly, one can say that there has been a most deplorable
                misunderstanding here.</p>
            <p>
                <stress reason="family">I think that, with hindsight, you would now no longer speak
                    as you did on that evening. That concerned me alone — and I could take it, so
                    there’s no question of my reproaching you in this matter.</stress>
            </p>
            <p>Only as an explanation for you, I say, just as you spoke to me, who can take it, so
                her sisters spoke to her, who was made distraught by it. You have nothing to do with
                it, because you spoke to me, who can take it, and you did not speak to her.</p>
            <p>But the real fault lies with her sisters, or rather one of the sisters in particular,
                who proves to be very hard, since she’s actually still sulking and bearing a
                grudge.</p>
            <p>You — would have to tell me again yourself that you bear a grudge — before I would
                suspect you of it.</p>
            <p>So much on my part to you.</p>

        <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
        <body>
            <p> Thanks for your last letter, which I was happy to receive and for which I heartily
                thank you. What you write about Mr Tersteeg’s loss, that his youngest child has
                died, moved me, and I felt the need to start corresponding with him again. </p>
            <p> Yesterday a letter from Anna, who arrives today at 12:45 with Van Houten, am very
                much looking forward to meeting them, he seems to have made a good impression on
                you, as he did on everyone at home, we must simply consider it an asset. </p>
            <p> So you were at Mauve’s and had a good time there, did you draw anything while you
                were there? I was also in Weissenbruch’s studio once, a couple of days before my
                first trip to London, and the recollection of what I saw there in the way of studies
                and paintings is still very clear, as is that of the man himself. When next you
                write, tell me something about the exhibition that will have opened yesterday, how
                much the artists would be able to find here at the dockyard that’s fit to be
                painted. The Rev. Meijjes was here a few days ago with 2 of his sons, and Uncle gave
                us permission to go and see the yard and the workshops, the forges and so on were of
                course in use, everything was standing still that Sunday we were there together. Was
                also with Uncle Pompe and Jan on the guardship the Wassenaar, which is also very
                interesting. This week the house here was full of people, Uncle and Aunt Pompe and
                Jan, Uncle Cor and Vincent, Fanny and Bet ’s Graeuwen and Bertha van Gogh from
                Haarlem, the last is a very sweet girl. </p>
            <p> Went last Sunday to the early sermon given by the Rev. Hasebroek, and again in the
                morning to that Oudezijdskapel I already told you about. The Rev. Van Marken
                preached very beautifully on Matth. IX:9. Jesus saw a man, named Matthew, sitting at
                the receipt of custom: and he saith unto him, Follow Me, and in the next part of
                that chapter: Jesus ate with publicans and sinners. They that be whole need not a
                physician, but they that are sick. I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners
                to repentance. </p>
            <p> So day by day I do my best to settle in, especially in Latin and Greek, and have
                already written quite a few themes, composed of phrases that remind me of the old
                schooldays, such as ‘Which eminent philosopher was sentenced to death by the
                Athenians? The very good and wise Socrates. Our life is very similar to a journey,
                and open to very many and very great catastrophes and accidents. The nature of
                Odysseus, and the grapes of the vineyard’. I was up early this morning, it had
                rained a lot during the night, but the sun broke through the clouds very early, the
                ground and the piles of timber and beams in the yard were drenched, and the sky
                reflected in the puddles was completely golden due to the rising sun, and at 5
                o’clock one saw all those hundreds of workers looking like little black figures
                fanning out on all sides. <good_health>I go to Uncle Stricker’s study quite a lot.
                    He’s very clever and has lots of beautiful books, and he has a great love for
                    his work and his position.</good_health> Got a very cheerful letter last Monday
                from Pa in Helvoirt. </p>
            <p>I heard from home that you got a bill from Dr Coster for 40 guilders, that’s rather a
                burden, and paying it will remind you of the feeling one has when a tooth is pulled,
                if only I could help you, but you know that I have neither gold nor silver. I often
                have to use my cunning to get money for the collection at church, for example by
                exchanging stamps for cents at a tobacconist’s, but old boy, struggling we stay on
                top, and you know that it is said of the poor in the kingdom of heaven that they are
                blessed. <good_health>Every time I see Uncle Vincent I’m moved by something
                    indescribably kind and, I might say, something good and spirited in him, I don’t
                    know what it is</good_health>, Pa has much more of it still, and Uncle Jan has
                it in another form, and it’s in Uncle Cor as well, among a hundred people one
                wouldn’t always find even one who calls them to mind, do let us preserve their image
                and their memory. Could it be that which Fénelon describes as follows in his
                Télémaque?The man to whom he had by chance presented himself was a stranger, who had
                an air of majesty, and yet something that was sad and downcast; at times he appeared
                dreamy, at others he had something that was either very determined or excited and
                agitated. At first he hardly listened to Telemachus’s question, but at last he
                replied: You are not mistaken, Ulysses was received at the home of King Alcinous, as
                in a place where God is feared and hospitality is practised, but he is no longer
                there, and you would search for him in vain; he has departed for Ithaca, if indeed
                the angry Gods eventually permit him to see his household deities again. Telemachus
                looked at him intently; the longer he looked, the more moved and astonished he was.
                This stranger, he said to Mentor, answered me like a man who scarcely listens to
                what is said to him, and who is full of bitterness. I pity the unfortunate since I
                have become one of them, and I feel that my heart is drawn toward this man, without
                knowing why. He did not receive me well; he hardly deigned to listen to me, or to
                reply. And so Mentor said to him, I am not at all astonished, my dear Telemachus, to
                see you thus moved; the cause of your pain, who is a stranger to you, is not so to
                Mentor, it is nature that speaks and makes itself felt, it is nature that softens
                your heart. The stranger who caused you such strong emotion is the great Ulysses. He
                is sailing straight to Ithaca, he is already very close to port, and at last he sees
                again those places so long yearned for. Your eyes saw him, but without knowing him;
                soon you will see him and you will know him — and he will know you, but now the Gods
                could not allow you to acknowledge each other, away from Ithaca. His heart was no
                less moved than yours; he is too wise to reveal himself to any mortal, in a place
                where he could be exposed to treachery. Ulysses, your father, is the wisest of all
                men; his heart is like a deep well, its secret could not be drawn from it. He loves
                truth, and never says aught that might wound it, but he speaks it only out of
                necessity, and wisdom, like a seal, ever keeps his lips closed to needless words.
                How moved he was when speaking to you! What violence did he do himself, so as in no
                wise to disclose himself! What did he not suffer, seeing you? That is what made him
                sad and downcast.And now, old chap, a hearty handshake in thought, let us but keep
                our faith in God and continue to worship what we know, give my regards to those at
                Mauve’s and anyone else you might see, especially your housemates, I wish you the
                very best, I sincerely hope you find a way of paying that bill, adieu and believe
                me</p>

        <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
        <body>
            <p> The time is approaching when you’ll go travelling for the Messrs Cie, and I’m
                already looking forward to seeing and talking to you again. </p>
            <p> What I wanted to ask you is this. Wouldn’t you be able to arrange it so that we
                could be together for a while, quietly and calmly, I was thinking of at least one
                whole day. Mendes was out of town this week, staying for a few days with a Rev.
                Schröder in Zwolle who had lessons from him at one time. Being less occupied because
                of this, <good_health>I could carry out my plan to see the etchings by Rembrandt in
                    the Trippenhuis, went there this morning and am glad I did it.</good_health>
            </p>
            <p> When I was there I thought, won’t Theo and I be able to see them together sometime?
                Think about whether you couldn’t go off on your own for a day or even longer for
                such things. </p>
            <p> How much someone like Pa – who ofttimes travels at night, carrying a lantern, to a
                sick or dying person, for example, to speak to him about Him whose word is also a
                light in the night of suffering and mortal fear – would have a feeling for
                Rembrandt’s etchings. Such as the flight into Egypt at night or the entombment of
                Jesus. That collection in the Trippenhuis is splendid, and I saw much that I’d never
                encountered before, there they also told me about drawings by R. in the Fodor. If
                you think it’s a good idea, speak to Mr Tersteeg about it, and write a few words in
                advance and tell me when you’re coming, then I’ll study ahead to be free and at your
                disposal when you come. </p>
            <p> I can’t see anything of that kind, paintings either, for example, without thinking
                of you and of Pa and everyone at home. </p>
            <p>
                <stress reason="career">Am otherwise up to my ears in work</stress>, because it’s
                becoming clear to me what I actually have to know, what they know and what inspires
                those whom I should like to follow. ‘Search the scriptures’ is not written for
                nothing, but those words are a good guide, and I’d really like to become such a
                scribe who is like unto a man that is an householder, which bringeth forth out of
                his treasure things old and new. </p>
            <p> I spent Monday evening with Vos and Kee, they’re fond of each other and one
                certainly notices that where Love lives the Lord commands His blessing. It’s nice at
                their house, only a great pity that he couldn’t go on being a minister. When one
                sees them sitting there together in the evening by the kindly light of their lamp in
                the little living room and close by the bedroom of their little boy, who wakes from
                time to time and asks his mother for this or that, it’s an idyll, but they also know
                dreadful days and sleepless nights, and fear and anxiety. Walked back over the big
                sand works by the Oosterspoor which you know, and along Buitenkant, the moon was
                shining and everything was full of M. Maris or Andersen. </p>
            <p> From there it’s such a wonderful sight across the city and towers, with lights here
                and there, on one side the IJ and on the other Bickerseiland. And everything was so
                deathly still, ‘the withered leaf does not rustle, the stars alone speak. When all
                sounds cease, God’s voice is heard under the stars’. </p>
            <p> Was in the Oudezijdskapel last Sunday, where the Rev. Jer. Meijjes preached on Eccl.
                XI:7XII:7.‘Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to
                behold the sun: but if a man live many years, and rejoice in them all; yet let him
                remember the days of darkness; for they shall be many. All that cometh is vanity.
                Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy
                youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know
                thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into judgement. Therefore remove
                heaviness from thy heart, and put away evil from thy flesh: for childhood and youth
                are vanity. Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days
                come not, nor the years draw nigh, nor the stars be darkened, nor the clouds return
                after the rain. </p>
            <p> In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow
                themselves, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those that look out of
                the windows be darkened, and the door shall be shut in the streets, when the sound
                of the grinding is low, and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird, and all the
                daughters of musick shall be brought low; also when they shall be afraid of that
                which is high, and fears shall be in the way, and the almond tree shall flourish,
                and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail: because man goeth to
                his long home, and the mourners go about the streets: or ever the silver bowl be
                loosed, or the wheel broken at the cistern. Then shall the dust return to the earth
                as it was: and the spirit shall turn unto God Who gave it.’ For whatsoever a man
                soweth, that shall he also reap and he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit
                reap Life Everlasting.I then heard the Rev. Laurillard again in the early sermon on
                Jer. VIII:7, Yea, the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times; and the
                turtle and the crane and the swallow observe the time of their coming. </p>
            <p> He told about how he had walked on a road where the leaves were already falling from
                the trees, and had seen a flock of migratory birds and spoke about the phenomenon of
                birds migrating, and how man will also migrate once to a warmer land. He treated
                this subject in the spirit of Michelet or Rückert, or as many have also painted it,
                including Protais, Souvenirs of the homeland. </p>
            <p> Pa wrote that you’d been to Antwerp, am eager to hear what you saw there, long ago I
                also saw the old paintings in the museum – and even seem to recall a beautiful
                portrait by Rembrandt, it would be wonderful if one could remember everything
                clearly, but it’s just like the sight of a long road, in the distance things seem
                smaller and as though in a mist. </p>
            <p> There was a fire here one evening on the water, namely a barge with arrack or
                something similar. Was with Uncle on the Wassenaar, there was no real danger as
                they’d managed to get the burning barge out from between the other boats and had
                tied it to a post. When the flames got up a bit one saw Buitenkant and the black row
                of people standing there watching, and the little boats going back and forth around
                the blaze also appeared black in the water in which the flames were reflected, I
                don’t know if you’re familiar with photographs after Jazet that were in the Galerie
                photographique at one time but have now been destroyed, ‘Christmas Eve’, ‘The
                conflagration’ and others, it was something like that. </p>
            <p>
                <unstress reason="environment">Twilight is already falling, ‘blessed twilight’
                    Dickens called it, and indeed he was right.</unstress> Blessed twilight
                especially when two or three are gathered together in harmony of mind, and like the
                scribes bring forth out of their treasure old and new things just like a
                householder. Blessed twilight when two or three are gathered together in His name
                and He himself is in the midst of them. And blessed is he who knows these things and
                also does them. Rembrandt knew that, for out of the rich treasure of his heart he
                brought forth, among other things, that drawing in sepia, charcoal, ink. (which is
                in the British Museum) depicting the house in Bethany. In that room twilight
                dominates, the figure of the Lord, noble and impressive, stands out gravely against
                the window through which the evening twilight falls. Just like the figure of John
                Halifax. He said he was a Christian, in front of a window with white curtains in a
                room in Rose Cottage, I think, on an evening like so many that are described with so
                much feeling in that book. At Jesus’ feet sits Mary, who had chosen that good part
                which would not be taken away from her, and Martha is in the room busy with
                something or other, stirring up the fire or something like that, if I remember
                rightly. I hope not to forget that drawing, nor what it seemed to be saying to me: I
                am the light of the world: he that followeth Me shall not walk in darkness, but
                shall have the light of life, the light of the gospel that is preached to the poor
                in My Father’s Kingdom, that shines, like a candle placed on a candlestick, on all
                that are in the house. I am come that they shall have life and that they shall have
                abundance. I am the Resurrection, and the Life: he that believeth in Me, though he
                were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and believeth in Me shall never
                die. If a man love Me, My Father will honour him and We will come unto him, and make
                our abode with him, We will come in to him, and will sup with him. The twilight says
                such things to those who have ears with which to hear and a heart with which to
                understand and to have faith in God – blessed twilight. </p>
            <p> And it’s also twilight in that painting by Ruipérez, The imitation of Jesus Christ,
                and also in another etching by Rembrandt, ‘David praying to God’, yes! we may thank
                ‘blessed twilight’ for the words ‘as the hart panteth after the water brooks, so
                panteth my soul after Thee, O God. My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God. </p>
            <p> Deep calleth unto deep: all Thy waves and Thy billows are gone over me. Yet the Lord
                will command His lovingkindness in the daytime, and in the night his song shall be
                with me, and my prayer unto the God of my life. Why art thou cast down, O my soul?
                And why art thou disquieted within me? Hope thou in God; for I shall yet praise Him,
                Who is the health of my countenance, and my God’. </p>
            <p> But it isn’t always ‘blessed twilight’, as you see from my handwriting I’m by the
                lamp upstairs, because there are people downstairs and I can’t sit with them with my
                books. </p>
            <p> Uncle Jan sends you his regards, Hendrik and Marie were here for a day this past
                week and have now left. Monday a telegram that the Madura had arrived at
                Southampton. The day of their departure Uncle left in the morning with the 6 o’clock
                train with Mr Vos, who had come here the previous evening from Utrecht – for
                Nieuwediep to say goodbye to them on board. </p>
            <p> I wish you well, write soon and do come soon, because it’s good to see each other
                again and to talk, perhaps we could go together to see the exhibition that will open
                one of these days. Give my regards, too, to your housemates. Old boy, how wonderful
                it must be to have a life behind one like Pa has, God grant that we be and that we
                may become more and more sons after His spirit and heart, something may yet come of
                that, He can raise a person above that which is his nature, His strength can be made
                perfect in our weakness. </p>

        <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
        <body>
            <p> It’s time to write to you again, how I should like to have been with you today,
                    <unstress reason="environment">it was such beautiful weather here, and one feels
                    that spring is coming.</unstress>
            </p>
            <p> In the country one would probably have been able to hear a lark, but that’s
                difficult in the city, unless one notices the sounds of the lark’s song in the voice
                of some old minister whose words come from a heart tuned like a lark’s. </p>
            <p> Heard the Rev. Laurillard this morning, preaching in the Oudezijdskapel, Uncle
                Stricker was in that church too, and I had coffee with him. Uncle Jan went this
                morning to ’t Nieuwe Diep, but has come back again. Then to a Sunday school in
                Barndesteeg, and then walked around the outer canals, visiting three Roman Catholic
                churches along the way. </p>
            <p> Went yesterday to see Vos who is but poorly, it’s such a sad sight, seeing him
                sitting with his feet on a stove, for he’s troubled by cold feet, staring out the
                window with his hollow eyes. Kee is just as pale and looks so tired, went from there
                to Uncle Cor’s again, he’s had the gallery newly wallpapered and a new grey carpet
                laid on the floor, now those beautiful cupboards containing the whole Gazette des
                BeauxArts etc. in red volumes stand out better than before.<bad_health> Uncle told
                    me that Daubigny has died, I freely admit that it made me sad to hear
                    it,</bad_health> just as it did to hear that Brion had died (his Saying grace is
                hanging in my room), because the work of such men, if one understands it, moves one
                more deeply than one is aware of, it must be truly good, when one dies, to be
                conscious of having done a thing or two in truth, knowing that as a result one will
                continue to live in the memory of at least a few, and having left a good example to
                those who follow. A work that is good — it can hardly last for eternity but the idea
                expressed in it can, and the work itself almost certainly continues to exist for a
                long time and, if others appear later, they can do no better than to follow in the
                footsteps of such predecessors and to do it the same way. </p>
            <p> Speaking of a good work, would you care to have a Flemish Imitation of Christ? I
                hope to send it to you shortly, a little book that one can easily put in one’s
                pocket if necessary. </p>
            <p> When Uncle told me about Daubigny, his etchings after Ruisdael, The bush and The ray
                of sunlight, came to mind, and he promised to send for them sometime, since he
                didn’t know them at all. </p>
            <p> Was at the Rev. Gagnebin’s last Monday evening and also saw his wife and daughter,
                and was also in his study, where I talked to him until about 11 o’clock. </p>
            <p> He said, among other things, that at certain times in his life he had benefited from
                forgetting himself altogether and throwing himself into work without a second
                thought; that he had done a lot then and had later found himself stronger and more
                advanced in what he intended to do and clear in his mind. That nevertheless, even
                now, nobody had any idea how much effort his sermons cost him. <work origin="new"
                    stage="finished">Have worked my way through the history of the Netherlands and
                    made an extract of 30 pages, closely written. (I was pleased to come across the
                    Battle of Waterloo and the 10day campaign again.)</work> Did you know that
                Rochussen once painted the siege of Leiden? The painting belongs, I think, to Mr de
                    Vos.<work stage="middle" origin="new"> Am now working on general history as
                    well.</work> I really long for you to come here again, be sure and do your best
                to stay as long as possible. And write again soon if you can, for you must know that
                you always give me so much joy by doing so. </p>
            <p> Have you read anything beautiful lately? Do make sure somehow to get hold of and
                read the books by Eliot, you won’t be sorry, Adam Bede, Silas Marner, Felix Holt,
                Romola (Savonarola’s story), Scenes of clerical life. You know we gave the 3
                underlined ones to Pa on his birthday last year. </p>
            <p> When I get the time for reading, I’ll read them again. Both the Rev. Macfarlane and
                the Rev. Adler spoke to me about them, i.e. advised me to read them. </p>
            <p> Wrote to Harry Gladwell again this week, since he didn’t answer my last letter and I
                wanted so much to know what he’s doing and what he’s planning to do. </p>
            <p> I still have hopes of his becoming a minister, and if that happens he’ll do it well,
                of that I’m convinced, but it would be no easy thing for him to carry it off. </p>
            <p> Have you ever seen an etching by Millet himself, a man pushing a wheelbarrow of dung
                into a garden on a day like today in early spring? And don’t forget that he also
                made the etching ‘The diggers’, if you ever run into it you won’t easily forget it.
                Thought today of the former, this morning when Uncle Stricker was looking for texts
                in which the word dung occurs, one of which is ‘let it alone this year also, till I
                shall dig about it, and dung it’. </p>
            <p> Recently made a list of the paintings by Brion that I could remember, next time you
                come you must tell me whether I’ve forgotten many. Lord keep my memory green! One
                must say that over and over again. </p>
            <p> Was last Sunday evening at cousin Vrijdag’s in Houttuinen, there are still 7
                children at home, it was a pleasant little circle, most of them are still very
                young. </p>
            <p> Couldn’t you say a bit in advance when you’ll be coming? I’ll count on it, then, by
                working ahead a little so we can spend some time together. Adieu, a handshake in
                thought, and believe me</p>

    <letter>
        <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
        <body>
            <p>Thanks for your letter — Ma’s doing well — at the outset the doctor said it would be
                six months before the leg had healed — now he’s talking about a good 3 months — and
                he said to Ma — ‘but that’s your daughter’s fault, for I seldom, very seldom, see
                such good care as she gives’. What Wil does is exemplary, exemplary, I shan’t easily
                forget that.</p>
            <p>Almost everything has fallen on her shoulders from the outset, and she’s spared Ma a
                great deal of misery.</p>
            <p>To mention just one thing, it’s definitely her fault that Ma has so few bedsores
                (which started very badly at the beginning and had deteriorated). And I assure you
                that the chores she has to do aren’t always pleasant.</p>
            <p>Now listen — when I’d read your letter about the drawings, I immediately sent you
                    <work origin="new" stage="finished">a new watercolour of a weaver</work> and
                    <work stage="finished" origin="existing">five pen drawings</work>. <stress
                    reason="career">For my part, too, I’ll tell you frankly that I think that what
                    you say is true, that my work will have to get much better,</stress> but at the
                same time also that your efforts to do something with it might also be a little more
                decisive. <stress reason="family">You have never yet sold a single thing of mine —
                    not for a lot or a little — and IN FACT HAVEN’T TRIED TO YET. As you can see,
                    I’m not getting angry about it — but — there’s no need to beat about the bush. I
                    certainly wouldn’t put up with it in the long run.</stress></p>
            <p>For your part, you can also continue to speak frankly.</p>
            <p>As far as saleability and unsaleability are concerned, that’s an old file I don’t
                intend to blunt my teeth on.</p>
            <p>Well, you see that my answer is that I send some new ones — and I’ll very willingly
                go on doing so — Id like nothing better than that. Only you must be totally frank
                for once — which is what I’d prefer — as to whether you think you’ll bother yourself
                with them in the future, or whether your dignity won’t permit it. Leaving aside the
                past — I’m facing the future, and not counting what you think of them, I fully
                intend to try to do something with them.</p>
            <p>You recently told me yourself that you’re a dealer — very well — one doesn’t lapse
                into sentimentality with a dealer; one says, sir, if I give you drawings on
                commission, may I count on your showing them? The dealer has to decide for himself
                whether he wants to say yes — no — or something in between.</p>
            <p>
                <stress reason="career">But the painter would be foolish to send them on commission
                    if he could tell that the dealer considered his work to be something that
                    shouldn’t see the light of day.</stress>
            </p>
            <p>Now, old chap — we both live in the real world — and precisely because we don’t want
                to put a spoke in each other’s wheels, we must speak candidly. If you say — I can’t
                be bothered with them — very well, I won’t get angry about it — but then I’m not
                obliged to believe that you’re an absolute oracle either, am I?</p>
            <p>You say: the public will be annoyed by this little spot. Now listen, that may be so,
                but this or that bothers you, the dealer, much more than the public in question,
                I’ve already remarked on that so often — and you start with that. I have to fight my
                way through, too, Theo, and with you I’m still at precisely, precisely the same
                level as a few years ago. What you say of my current work — ‘it is almost saleable
                but’ — is word for word the same as what you wrote to me when I sent you my first
                Brabant sketches from Etten. So I say — it’s an old file. And my reasoning is that I
                foresee that you’ll always say the same thing — and that <stress reason="career">I,
                    who until today have been consistently rather chary of making approaches to
                    dealers, will now change tactics and become very assiduous in trying to sell my
                    work.</stress></p>
            <p><bad_health>I do understand that you couldn’t care less about my doings. But if you
                    couldn’t care less, for my part I always find it fairly wretched and rather
                    dread things that will probably crop up — namely that people will ask me: what,
                    don’t you do business with your brother or with Goupil? Well, then I’ll say —
                    it’s beneath the dignity of those Messrs Gie, Van Gogh Co. This will probably
                    create a bad impression of me — which I’m quite prepared for — but which I
                    foresee will consequently make me cooler and cooler towards you
                too</bad_health>.</p>
            <p><work origin="new" stage="finished">I’ve now painted the little old church and
                    another new weaver.</work> Are the studies from Drenthe really so very bad? I
                don’t feel inclined to send you the painted studies from here, no, let’s not start
                on that — you can see them if you come here sometime in the spring, perhaps.</p>
            <p>What you write about Marie is quite understandable — if a woman isn’t very milk and
                water I can very well imagine that she has little inclination to mope around with
                cantankerous fathers and pious sisters, at least a woman as much as a man would feel
                a fairly pressing temptation to end that stagnation, come what may.</p>
            <p>Stagnation that begins with a resignation that is perhaps fine in itself, but which
                alas one must come to regret, usually, when one feels one would eventually freeze.
                Read something by Daudet about pious women, ‘Those two faces looked at each other —
                they exchanged a spiteful, cold, closed look — what’s the matter with him/her?
                Always the same thing’. There you have it, that singular look of Pharisees and
                devout ladies. Yes, therefore we always lack — the same thing. Yes — what am I
                supposed to think about what you say about my work? For example, <work
                    stage="finished" origin="existing">I’ll now turn specifically to the studies
                    from Drenthe — there are some among them that are very superficial, I said that
                    myself — but what do I get served up for the ones that were simply painted
                    quietly and calmly outdoors, trying to say nothing in them but what I saw?
                </work>I get in return: aren’t you too preoccupied with Michel? (I’m talking here
                about the study of the little hut in the dark and about the largest of the sod huts,
                namely the one with the little green field in the foreground.) You would certainly
                say exactly the same thing about the little old churchyard.</p>
            <p>And yet, neither looking at the little churchyard nor at the sod huts did I think
                about Michel, I thought about the subject I was looking at. A subject indeed such
                that I believe, if Michel had passed by, it would have brought him to a halt and
                struck him.</p>
            <p>For my part, I certainly don’t put myself on a par with master Michel — but I
                definitely don’t therefore imitate Michel either.</p>
            <p>Well, I may perhaps try to sell something in Antwerp, and I’d like to put a couple of
                those selfsame Drenthe studies in black wooden frames — which I’m looking for at a
                carpenter’s here — I prefer to see my work in a deep black frame, and he makes them
                cheaply enough. You mustn’t take it amiss that I mention it, brother.</p>
            <p>I’m seeking something calm and something cool in my work. No more than I approve of
                its just lying about, do I want my work to be displayed in fluted frames in the
                leading galleries, you see. <stress reason="family">And now it’s time to begin on
                    that middle way, in my view, and I have to know fairly definitely how I stand
                    with you, or rather I tell you that, although you’re still evading the issue in
                    what you say, I believe that you will not in fact show it. And I don’t even
                    believe that you’ll change your mind for the time being.</stress></p>
            <p>Whether you’re right or wrong about this — I’m not going into that. You’ll tell me
                that I’ll be treated by other dealers exactly the same as by you, except that,
                    <stress reason="money">although you can’t be bothered with my work, you furnish
                    me with money anyway, and other dealers certainly won’t do that, and without
                    money I’ll become completely stuck.</stress></p>
            <p>I say in reply that things aren’t as clearcut as that in real life, and that I’ll see
                how far I get living from day to day. I told you beforehand that I wanted to settle
                these matters this month, and so it must be done.<stress reason="career"> Well,
                    because you probably plan to come as early as the spring I don’t insist that you
                    make a final decision immediately, but realize that I can’t accept it as it is
                    now — for myself, wherever I go and especially at home, too, I’m always being
                    watched — what I do with my work, whether I get anything for it and, in short in
                    society almost everyone looks out for it all the time and wants to know all
                    about it.</stress></p>
            <p>And this is very understandable. Well, it’s very wretched for me always being in a
                false position.</p>
            <p>Come on — things can’t stay the same as they are now. Why not? Because they
                can’t.</p>
            <p>If I’m as cool as can be to Pa — to C.M. — why should I behave any differently
                towards you were I to observe in you precisely the same tactics of never speaking
                out. Do I consider myself better than Pa or you? Perhaps not, perhaps I divide
                things less and less into good and bad — but I do know that these tactics don’t
                befit a painter and that, as a painter, one must speak out and resolve certain
                things. In short — I believe that a door should either be open or shut.</p>
            <p>Well, I think you do understand that a dealer cannot be neutral towards painters —
                that it makes exactly the same impression whether you say no with or without mincing
                your words, and that it may be even more infuriating when it’s said wrapped up in
                compliments.</p>
            <p>Now here’s something that you’ll perhaps understand later on better than you do now —
                I pity dealers when they get old — even if they’ve already made their piles — that
                doesn’t solve everything — at least not then. Everything has its price, and an
                icecold wilderness is what it often becomes for them then.</p>
            <p>Well — but you’ll perhaps think differently about it. And you’ll say that it’s also
                pretty sad when a painter dies miserably in a hospital and is buried with the whores
                in the common grave — where a lot of them lie, after all — <bad_health>particularly
                    when one considers that dying may not be as difficult as
                living.</bad_health></p>
            <p>Well, one can’t take it amiss that a dealer doesn’t always have the money to help,
                but one can, in my view, take it amiss if one notices that this respectable dealer
                or that speaks very cordially, but he’s ashamed of me in his heart and he completely
                ignores my work. <stress reason="career">So frankly, I won’t take it amiss if you
                    say straight out that you don’t think my work is good enough or that there are,
                    moreover, yet other reasons why you can’t be bothered with it, but if you leave
                    it in a corner somewhere and you don’t show it, this isn’t kind if it’s
                    accompanied by the assurance — WHICH IS NOT LIKELY — that you yourself see
                    something in it. I don’t believe that — you mean practically none of it. And
                    precisely because you say yourself that you know my work better than anyone
                    else, I may assume that you must think very badly of it indeed if you don’t want
                    to soil your hands with it. Why should I force myself on you?</stress> Well,
                regards.</p>

        <close>Yours truly,</close>
        <sig>Vincent</sig>
        <ps>
            <p>
                <bad_health>Apart from a few years which I find hard to understand myself, when I
                    was confused by religious ideas — by a sort of mysticism — leaving aside that
                    period, I’ve always lived with a certain warmth. Now it’s all becoming bleaker
                    and colder and duller around me. </bad_health>And when I tell you that in the
                first place I WILL not stand it like this, never mind whether or not I can, I refer
                to what I said right at the very beginning of our relationship. What I’ve had
                against you in the last year is a sort of relapse into cold decency, which I find
                sterile and of no use to one — diametrically opposed to everything that is action,
                especially to everything that is artistic. </p>
            <p> I say it as I see it, not to make you wretched but to get you to see and feel if
                possible the reason that I no longer think of you as a brother and friend with the
                same pleasure as before. There has to be more zest in my life if I want to get more
                brio into my brush — I won’t get a hair’s breadth further by exercising patience.
                If, for your part, you relapse into the abovementioned, don’t then take it amiss if
                I’m not the same towards you as I was in the first year, say. About my drawings — at
                this moment it seems to me that <work stage="finished" origin="existing">the
                    watercolours, the pen drawings of the weavers,</work>
                <work origin="new" stage="middle">the latest pen drawings I’m working on now,</work>
                aren’t so dull on the whole that they’re nothing at all. But if I come to the
                conclusion: they’re no good, and Theo is right not to show them to anyone — then —
                then — it will be all the more proof that I have good reason to dislike our present
                false position, and will try all the more to change, come what may — better or
                worse, but not the same. Now if I saw that, if you didn’t think I’d improved enough,
                you did something about it to get me further along by introducing me to another
                capable painter, for instance, because Mauve has dropped out, or anyway something,
                some sign or other that proved to me that you really believed in my progress or
                promoted it. <stress reason="money">But no, there’s — yes, the money — but otherwise
                    nothing except that ‘just keep on working’, ‘be patient’ — as cold, as dead, as
                    arid and as insufferable, just as if, for instance, Pa said it. I can’t live on
                    that — it’s too lonely, too cold, too empty and too lacklustre for me.</stress>
            </p>
            <p> I’m no better than anyone else, in so far as I have my needs and desires like
                everyone, and it’s very understandable that one reacts knowing for sure that one is
                really being kept dangling, in the dark. </p>
            <p> If one goes from bad to worse — this wouldn’t be impossible in my case — what would
                it matter? If one is badly off, one has to take a chance of making things better. </p>
            <p> Brother — I really must remind you of how I was at the very beginning of what we
                began. <stress reason="love">Right from the outset I’ve talked to you about the
                    question of women. I still recall that I took you to the station in Roosendaal
                    in the first year, and that I said to you then that I was so against being alone
                    that I would rather be with a common whore than alone</stress>. Perhaps you
                remember that. I found the idea that our relationship might not last almost
                unbearable at first. And I so very much wished that it had been simple to change
                things. However I can’t always keep on fooling myself that this can be done against
                the grain. </p>
            <p> The depression about it has thus been one of the reasons I wrote to you so
                assertively from Drenthe, become a painter yet. Which cooled off immediately when I
                saw that your dissatisfaction about business matters vanished when you were on
                better terms with Goupil again. </p>
            <p> At first I thought it was only half sincere — then later, and now, still, I think it
                very understandable and think it more a mistake on my part that I wrote to you,
                become a painter, than on yours that you resumed your affairs with enthusiasm when
                they became more possible to resume and the machinations making it impossible for
                you ceased. </p>
            <p>
                <stress reason="career">What remains, though, is that I still feel depressed by the
                    falseness of the position between us. At this moment it’s more important for me
                    to sell for 5 guilders than to receive 10 guilders by way of patronage.
                </stress>Well, you repeatedly write, actually most definitely, that you haven’t
                made, aren’t making, nor believe for the present you’re able to make the least or
                slightest effort for my work; first, not as a dealer (I let that pass, and at least
                don’t take it amiss of you) but, secondly, not in private either (and that I do take
                somewhat amiss of you). In this case I mustn’t sit doing nothing or be a
                    funker,<stress reason="family"> so straight out, if you do nothing with my work,
                    I don’t want your patronage. I state the reason plainly and I’ll state it
                    precisely the same way, when giving a reason for it is hard to avoid.</stress>
            </p>
            <p> So it isn’t that I want to ignore or belittle your help from the start until now.
                It’s a matter of my seeing more benefit in even the poorest, most wretched muddling
                along than in patronage (which it’s degenerating into). </p>
            <p> One can’t do without it at the very, very beginning, but now I must for God’s sake,
                God knows how, just start muddling along rather than acquiesce in something that
                would take us no further anyway. Brotherly or not brotherly, if you can do nothing
                other than absolutely the financial alone, you might as well keep that too. As it
                has been in the last year, I almost dare to say, it was confined solely to money. </p>
            <p>
                <stress reason="love">And although you say you give me a completely free hand, it
                    seemed to me, at bottom, that if I do this or that with a woman, for instance,
                    that you and others don’t approve of (perhaps rightly disapprove of, but
                    sometimes I don’t give a damn about that), there comes one of those little tugs
                    on the pursestrings just to make me feel that it’s ‘in my interest’ to go along
                    with your opinion.</stress>
            </p>
            <p> So you got your way regarding the woman, and it was finished, but — — — — — — what
                damn good is it to me to get a bit of money if it means I have to practise morality?
                Yet in itself I don’t think it something absurd in you when you disapproved this
                summer of my still wanting to go through with it. But I can foresee the following in
                the future: <stress reason="love">I’ll have another relationship in what you people
                    call the lower orders — and again, if I still have a relationship with you, meet
                    the same opposition. Opposition that you people could only carry through with
                    any semblance of fairness if I received so much from you that I could do
                    something different.</stress> Which you don’t give and can’t or won’t give,
                after all — neither you, nor Pa, nor C.M. or the rest, who are always first off the
                mark to disapprove of this or that — and which I don’t after all want from you
                either, since I don’t give much thought to the lower or upper orders. </p>
            <p> Do you see why it wasn’t an irresponsible action on my part, and wouldn’t be if I
                were to try it again? </p>
            <p><bad_health> Because first I don’t have any pretension, don’t feel any desire at all,
                    and secondly don’t receive the means from anyone whatsoever, or earn them, to
                    keep up some sort of position or whatever you call it — I consider myself
                    completely at liberty to consort with the socalled lower orders if the
                    opportunity arises.</bad_health> We’d perpetually return to the same questions. </p>
            <p> Just ask yourself now if I’m alone among those in the same profession who would most
                definitely turn down patronage if it entails obligations to maintain some sort of
                position while the money wasn’t enough to be able to do it, so that one gets into
                debt rather than make progress. If it could be done on the money, I might perhaps
                not refuse to bend, any more than others do. But we’re certainly not that far at
                present — I have a stretch of years in front of me, as you say yourself, when my
                work will have very little commercial value. Very well — THEN I WOULD RATHER FALL
                INTO THE HANDS OF MUDDLING ALONG and of living through hard times — which I’ve done
                more than once — than into the hands of Messrs Van Gogh. </p>
            <p> My only regret about arguing with Pa when I did is that I didn’t do it 10 years
                earlier. If you carry on in the footsteps of Pa and — you’ll just see how you’ll
                gradually get annoyed — and — how you would also become annoying to certain people.
                But those are awkward customers and, you’ll say — they’re of no consequence.</p>
        </ps>

        <salutation/>
        <body>
            <p> I’ve been thinking about what we discussed, and I couldn’t help thinking of the
                words ‘we are today what we were yesterday’. This isn’t to say that one must stand
                still and ought not try to develop oneself, on the contrary, there are compelling
                reasons to do and think so. </p>
            <p> But in order to remain faithful to those words one may not retreat and, once one has
                started to see things with a clear and trusting eye, one ought not to abandon or
                deviate from that. </p>
            <p> They who said ‘we are today what we were yesterday’, those were honnêtes hommes,
                which is apparent from the constitution they drew up, which will remain for all time
                and of which it has rightly been said that it was written with a ray from on high
                and a finger of fire. It is good to be an ‘honnête homme’ and truly to endeavour to
                become one both almost and altogether, and one does well if one believes that being
                an ‘homme intérieur et spirituel’ is part of it. </p>
            <p> If one only knew for certain that one belonged among them, one would always go one’s
                way, calmly and collectedly, never doubting that things would turn out well. There
                was once a man who went into a church one day and asked, can it be that my zeal has
                deceived me, that I have turned down the wrong path and have gone about things the
                wrong way, oh, if only I could rid myself of this uncertainty and have the firm
                conviction that I will eventually overcome and succeed. And then a voice answered
                him, And if you knew that for certain, what would you do? Act now as though you knew
                it for certain and thou shalt not be ashamed. Then the man went on his way, not
                faithless but believing, and returned to his work, no longer doubting or wavering. </p>
            <p> As far as being an homme intérieur et spirituel is concerned, couldn’t one develop
                that in oneself through knowledge of history in general and of certain people of all
                eras in particular, from biblical times to the Revolution and from The odyssey to
                the books of Dickens and Michelet? And couldn’t one learn something from the work of
                the likes of Rembrandt or from Weeds by Breton, or The four times of the day by
                Millet, or Saying grace by Degroux, or Brion, or The conscript by Degroux (or else
                by Conscience), or his Apothecary, or The large oaks by Dupré, or even the mills and
                sand flats by Michel? It’s by persevering in those ideas and things that one at last
                becomes thoroughly leavened with a good leaven, that of sorrowful yet alway
                rejoicing, and which will become apparent when the time of fruitfulness is come in
                our lives, the fruitfulness of good works. </p>
            <p> The ray from on high doesn’t always shine on us, and is sometimes behind the clouds,
                and without that light a person cannot live and is worth nothing and can do nothing
                good, and anyone who maintains that one can live without faith in that higher light
                and doesn’t worry about attaining it will end up being disappointed. </p>
            <p> We’ve talked quite a lot about what we feel to be our duty and how we should arrive
                at something good, and we rightly came to the conclusion that first of all our goal
                must be to find a certain position and a profession to which we can devote ourselves
                entirely. </p>
            <p> And I think that we also agreed on this point, namely that one must pay special
                attention to the end, and that a victory achieved after lifelong work and effort is
                better than one achieved more quickly. </p>
            <p> He who lives uprightly and experiences true difficulty and disappointment and is
                nonetheless undefeated by it is worth more than someone who prospers and knows
                nothing but relative good fortune. For who are they, those in whom one most clearly
                notices something higher? — it is those to whom the words ‘workers, your life is
                sad, workers, you suffer in life, workers, you are blessed’ are applicable, it is
                those who show the signs of ‘bearing a whole life of strife and work without giving
                way’. It is good to try and become thus. </p>
            <p> So we go on our way ‘undefessi favente Deo’. </p>
            <p>
                <stress reason="career">As far as I’m concerned, I must become a good minister, who
                    has something to say that is good and can be useful in the world, and perhaps
                    it’s good after all that I have a relatively long time of preparation and become
                    secure in a firm conviction before I’m called upon to speak about it to
                    others.</stress> It is wise, before one begins that work, to gather together a
                wealth of things that could benefit others. </p>
            <p> Do let us go on quietly, examining all things and holding fast to that which is
                good, and trying always to learn more that is useful, and gaining more experience. </p>
            <p> Woespiritedness is quite a good thing to have, if only one writes it as two words,
                woe is in all people, everyone has reason enough for it, but one must also have
                spirit, the more the better, and it is good to be someone who never despairs. If we
                but try to live uprightly, then we shall be all right, even though we shall
                inevitably experience true sorrow and genuine disappointments, and also probably
                make real mistakes and do wrong things, but it’s certainly true that it is better to
                be fervent in spirit, even if one accordingly makes more mistakes, than narrowminded
                and overly cautious. It is good to love as much as one can, for therein lies true
                strength, and he who loves much does much and is capable of much, and that which is
                done with love is well done. If one is moved by some book or other, for instance,
                just to mention something, ‘The swallow, the lark, the nightingale’, The longing for
                autumn, ‘From here I see a lady’, ‘Never this unique little village’ by Michelet,
                it’s because it’s written from the heart in simplicity and with poverty of spirit. </p>
            <p> If one were to say but few words, though ones with meaning, one would do better than
                to say many that were only empty sounds, and just as easy to utter as they were of
                little use. </p>
            <p> Love is the best and most noble thing in the human heart, especially when it has
                been tried and tested in life like gold in the fire, happy is he and strong in
                himself who has loved much and, even if he has wavered and doubted, has kept that
                divine fire and has returned to that which was in the beginning and shall never die.
                If only one continues to love faithfully that which is verily worthy of love, and
                does not squander his love on truly trivial and insignificant and fainthearted
                things, then one will gradually become more enlightened and stronger. The sooner one
                seeks to become competent in a certain position and in a certain profession, and
                adopts a fairly independent way of thinking and acting, and the more one observes
                fixed rules, the stronger one’s character becomes, and yet that doesn’t mean that
                one has to become narrowminded. </p>
            <p> It is wise to do that, for life is but short and time passes quickly. If one is
                competent in one thing and understands one thing well, one gains at the same time
                insight into and knowledge of many other things into the bargain. </p>
            <p> It’s sometimes good to go about much in the world and to be among people, and at
                times one is actually obliged and called upon to do so, or it can be one way of
                ‘throwing oneself into one’s work unreservedly and with all one’s might’, but he who
                actually goes quietly about his work, alone, preferring to have but very few
                friends, goes the most safely among people and in the world. One should never trust
                it when one is without difficulties or some worry or obstacle, and one shouldn’t
                make things too easy for oneself. Even in the most cultured circles and the best
                surroundings and circumstances, one should retain something of the original nature
                of a Robinson Crusoe or a savage, for otherwise one hath not root in himself, and
                never let the fire in his soul go out but keep it going, there will always be a time
                when it will come in useful. And whosoever continues to hold fast to poverty for
                himself, and embraces it, possesses a great treasure and will always hear the voice
                of his conscience speaking clearly. Whosoever hears and follows the voice in his
                innermost being, which is God’s best gift, ultimately finds therein a friend and is
                never alone. Happy is he who has faith in God, for he shall overcome all of life’s
                difficulties in the end, though it be not without pain and sorrow. One cannot do
                better than to hold fast to the thought of God and endeavour to learn more of Him,
                amidst everything, in all circumstances, in all places and at all times; one can do
                this with the Bible as with all other things. It is good to go on believing that
                everything is miraculous, more so than one can comprehend, for that is the truth, it
                is good to remain sensitive and lowly and meek in heart, even though one sometimes
                has to hide that feeling, because that is often necessary, it is good to be very
                knowledgeable about the things that are hidden from the wise and prudent of the
                world but that are revealed as though by nature to the poor and simple, to women and
                babes. For what can one learn that is better than that which God has put by nature
                into every human soul, that which in the depths of every soul lives and loves, hopes
                and believes, unless one should wilfully destroy it? There, in that, is the need for
                nothing less than the boundless and miraculous, and a man does well if he is
                satisfied with nothing less and doesn’t feel at home until he has acquired it. </p>
            <p> That is the avowal that all great men have expressed in their works, all who have
                thought a little more deeply and have sought and worked a little harder and have
                loved more than others, who have launched out into the deep of the sea of life.
                Launching out into the deep is what we too must do if we want to catch anything, and
                if it sometimes happens that we have to work the whole night and catch nothing, then
                it is good not to give up after all but to let down the nets again at dawn. </p>
            <p> So let us simply go on quietly, each his own way, always following the light ‘sursum
                corda’, and as such who know that we are what others are and that others are what we
                are, and that it is good to have love one to another namely of the best kind, that
                believeth all things and hopeth all things, endureth all things and never faileth. </p>
            <p> And not troubling ourselves too much if we have shortcomings, for he who has none
                has a shortcoming nonetheless, namely that he has none, and he who thinks he is
                perfectly wise would do well to start over from the beginning and become a fool. </p>
            <p> We are today what we were yesterday, namely ‘honnêtes hommes’, but ones who must be
                tried with the fire of life to be innerly strengthened and confirmed in that which
                they are by nature through the grace of God. </p>
            <p>May it be so with us, old boy, and I wish you well on your way, and God be with you
                in all things, and make you succeed at that, that is what is wished you with a
                hearty handshake at your departure by</p>

        <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
        <body>
            <p>Enclosed I’m sending you a list of colours I need as soon as possible.</p>
            <p><good_health>You gave me very great pleasure by sending me those
                    Millets</good_health>,<work origin="new" stage="middle"> I’m working on them
                    zealously.</work> I was growing flabby by dint of never seeing anything
                artistic, and this revives me. <work stage="finished" origin="existing">I’ve
                    finished The evening</work> and <work origin="new" stage="middle">am working on
                    The diggers and the man who’s putting his jacket on, no. 30 canvases, and The
                    sower, smaller.</work> The evening is in a range of violets and soft lilacs,
                with light from the lamp pale citron, then the orange glow of the fire and the man
                in red ochre. You will see it. It seems to me that doing painting after these Millet
                drawings is much rather to translate them into another language than to copy them.
                Apart from that I have a rain effect on the go, and an evening effect with tall
                pines. And also a leaffall.</p>
            <p><good_health>My health is very good</good_health> – <bad_health>except often a lot of
                    melancholy however</bad_health> – <unstress reason="environment">but I feel much
                    much better than when I came here, and even better than in
                    Paris.</unstress><unstress reason="career"> Also, as for the work the ideas are
                    becoming firmer, it seems to me.</unstress> But then I don’t quite know if you’d
                like what I’m doing now. For despite what you say in your previous letter, that the
                search for style often harms other qualities, the fact is that I feel myself greatly
                driven to seek style, if you like, but I mean by that a more manly and more
                deliberate drawing. If that will make me more like Bernard or Gauguin, I can’t do
                anything about it. But am inclined to believe that in the long run you’d get used to
                it. For yes, one must feel the wholeness of a country – isn’t that what
                distinguishes a Cézanne from something else. And Guillaumin, whom you mention, he
                has so much style and a personal way of drawing. Anyway, I’ll do as I can.</p>
            <p>Now that most of the leaves have fallen the landscape looks more like the north, and
                then I really feel that if I went back to the north I would see it more clearly than
                before.</p>
            <p>Health is a big thing, and a lot depends on it, as regards work too.</p>
            <p>
                <good_health>Fortunately those abominable nightmares no longer torment
                    me.</good_health>
            </p>
            <p>I hope to go to Arles in the next few days.</p>
            <p>I’d very much like Jo to see The evening, I think that I’ll send you a consignment
                shortly, but it’s drying very badly because of the dampness of the studio. Here the
                houses have scarcely any cellar or foundations, and one feels the damp more than in
                the north.</p>
            <p>At home they’ll have moved by now, I’ll add 6 canvases for them to the next
                consignment. Is it necessary to have them framed, perhaps not, for it isn’t worth
                it. Above all, don’t frame the studies I send you from time to time, that can be
                done later, pointless for them to take up too much room. <work stage="finished"
                    origin="new">I’ve also done a canvas for Mr Peyron, a view of the house with a
                    tall pine tree.</work></p>
            <p>I hope that your health and Jo’s continue to be good.</p>
            <p>
                <unstress reason="family">I’m so happy that you’re no longer alone, and that
                    everything’s more normal than before.</unstress>
            </p>
            <p>Is Gauguin back, and what’s Bernard doing?</p>
            <p>More soon, I shake your hand firmly, and Jo’s, and our friends’, and believe me</p>
        </body>
        <close>Ever yours,</close>
        <sig>Vincent</sig>
        <ps>
            <p>I’m trying to simplify the list of colours as much as possible – thus I very often
                use the ochres as in the old days. </p>
            <p> I know very well that the studies drawn with long, sinuous lines from the last
                consignment weren’t what they ought to become, however I dare urge you to believe
                that in landscapes one will continue to mass things by means of a drawing style that
                seeks to express the entanglement of the masses. Thus, do you remember Delacroix’s
                landscape, Jacob’s struggle with the angel? And there are others of his! For example
                the cliffs, and the very flowers you speak of sometimes. Bernard really has found
                perfect things in there. Anyway, don’t be too swift to adopt a prejudice against it. </p>
            <p>
                <work origin="new" stage="middle">Anyway, you’ll see that there’s already more
                    character in a large landscape with pines, red ochre trunks defined by a black
                    line than in the previous ones.</work>

        <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
        <body>
            <p>
                <good_health>Thanks for your letter of 17 February, which gave me not a little
                    pleasure</good_health>, as I had been longing for it so very much. And I’m going
                ahead and writing again so soon, old chap, because I think of you so often and also
                long for you, and every morning the prints on the wall of my study remind me of you,
                Christus Consolator and pendant, that wood engraving after Van Goyen, Dordrecht, the
                portrait of the Rev. Heldring, The oven by T. Rousseau and so on, because I got them
                all from you, and so the pot called the kettle black when you wrote that it was so
                wrong of me to give you a print for your room now and then, if I find something that
                goes with what you already have. So enough about that, I say in turn, but write and
                tell me whether you’ve added some good thing or other to your collection, do
                continue with it, because the way you do it and set about it, it’s most certainly a
                good work. </p>
            <p> Yesterday evening at C.M.’s I saw a whole year of that magazine L’Art, of which you
                have the issue with the woodcuts after Corot. <unstress reason="environment">What
                    especially struck me were woodcuts after drawings by Millet, including The
                    leaffall (shepherd guarding his flock), The flock of crows, donkeys in a marsh
                    (misty effect), The woodcutters, Housekeeper sweeping her house, Farmyard
                    (nocturnal effect), also an etching after Corot, The dune, and after Breton, The
                    feast of Saint John and others, by Chauvel, among others, and also one after
                    Millet, The beans.</unstress>
            </p>
            <p> Was with Uncle Jan the whole afternoon and evening of Sunday, 17 Feb. at Uncle
                Cor’s, where Aunt Antje is staying these days. </p>
            <p> It was Anna’s birthday, and it was also a good day for me. Got up quite early and
                went in the morning to the French church, where a minister from the vicinity of Lyon
                was preaching, he’d come to collect money for an evangelical mission. His sermon
                consisted mainly of stories from the lives of factory workers there, and although he
                wasn’t especially eloquent as far as ease of expression goes, and though one even
                noticed how difficult it was for him and a little awkward, as it were, his words
                were moving nonetheless, because they came from the heart, and that alone has the
                power to make an impression on other hearts. Afterwards, at 1 o’clock, I had to be
                at a Sunday school given by an English minister, Adler, in Barndesteeg, he has a
                small but very respectable old church there. The school, though, was held in a small
                room where the light had to be lit even at that hour, i.e. in the middle of the day.
                There were perhaps some 20 children from that poor neighbourhood. Although he’s a
                foreigner he nevertheless preaches in Dutch (though the English service), and also
                gives confirmation classes in Dutch, but very charmingly and capably. <work
                    origin="existing" stage="finished">Had taken along the sketch of that map of the
                    Holy Land that I’d made for Pa’s birthday </work>(with red chalk on heavy brown
                paper) and I gave it to him, because I thought that little room a nice place for it,
                and I’m glad it’s hanging on the wall there. </p>
            <p> Had met him at Mr Macfarlane’s, the minister of that little English church in the
                Begijnhof, where I had ventured to pay a visit. Was received with kindness and hope
                to go there again sometime.I then paid a visit on Sunday afternoon to Vos, who is
                but poorly and was lying in bed to rest a little, so I couldn’t see him. And then on
                to Uncle Stricker and after that to Uncle Cor. This morning I went back to see Vos,
                for I really wanted to see and speak to him myself. This time I found him up, but he
                doesn’t look at all well and Kee looked rather tired and pale too. </p>
            <p> Spent a long time there, they have a lot of worries, he brings up blood now and then
                and coughs a lot. Jan is staying at Uncle Stricker’s for a few days. </p>
            <p> Apart from visiting the English minister, I also ventured to pay a visit to the Rev.
                Gagnebin. Now that I’m really getting down to work and have thrown myself into the
                fight, it’s important to try to do it boldly and to set to work with relative
                forthrightness, even though there are still many obstacles to be overcome. By
                working and doing, one grows into the work and the doing of it, and perhaps the best
                way to acquire sufficient enthusiasm is to take the enthusiasm one has in oneself
                and to employ it and expend it and use it. </p>
            <p> The Rev. Gagnebin took it well and said that I should come back one evening,
                deciding on this evening, so I have to go there directly, and hope still to write
                and tell you how it was. Pa also advised me to try and make the acquaintance of a
                person or two. I did find it pleasant to speak French and English again; it’s a
                strange feeling if one hasn’t done it for a long time. Old boy, Dickens knew it,
                didn’t he, when he prayed, Lord keep my memory green yea evergreen. Amen. </p>
            <p>
                <work origin="existing" stage="middle">Twice I got up early in the morning to work
                    on a sketch of the map of the journeys of Paul that I still had, making it more
                    complete, so that now it looks good, with the names in French </work>even better
                than on the ones I made for Pa and for my study, with the idea of giving it to him,
                for if possible I wanted to highlight this visit, because he’s a clever man from
                whom I may get good advice later on, once he notices from one thing and another that
                I take it seriously. Also showed him the map of Brittany and Normandy and some
                French texts I have. </p>
            <p> Last week Nico Mager, who’s here in town, came to visit, and that pleased me. The
                contract he has with Mr Braat will expire in October or November, so he is free, but
                also compelled by necessity, to seek another position. He’s thinking of venturing
                abroad and had his eye on Geneva, where he’s been before, perhaps that isn’t such a
                bad plan after all. If now, meaning by October, there was a vacancy at Goupil’s,
                that would help him out immediately. He was planning to write to Uncle Cent again,
                around Uncle’s birthday on 28 March. I’ve seen that he can work well. He’s a nice
                chap, he asked me to send you his regards if I wrote. From him I also heard some
                news from Dordrecht. Lord keep my memory green. </p>
            <p> I took a walk with him as well. Also told him that I thought that a young man who
                knew what he knew – namely what one learns when one has worked diligently for some
                years in a bookshop or similar position – is almost sure to find, after a time of
                searching and difficulties in London or some other large English city, a position in
                which he could earn enough to support himself while also learning to speak good
                English. That once he had found something like that he could count on its being
                permanent, and that he would thus be secure, as it were, for a few years.One can
                profit a great deal, especially when one does more than the shop assistants there
                tend to do, and England certainly has an advantage over Paris in that one has a
                better chance of finding decent lodgings and a kind of home in middleclass
                surroundings, which is rather difficult in Paris. And I also told him to ‘hold fast
                to that which you have already’ and to go forth and see with your own eyes, because
                having been in a bookshop for so long and having worked there faithfully, as he has
                done, is an asset. </p>
            <p> You must write again soon, and as soon as you know when you’ll be making the trip,
                I’ll no doubt hear it, and I sincerely hope that when you’re here we’ll be able to
                spend some time together and that you won’t be too busy. </p>
            <p> Was just at the Rev. Gagnebin’s, but was told he was too busy to receive me (and yet
                he’d stipulated this hour and this day). I heard music in the house, so apparently
                something or other was going on. I left what I’d made for him and asked for it to be
                given to him. </p>
            <p>
                <stress reason="career">I feel the need to do something like that now and then, for
                    it’s most certainly in doubt whether I’ll pass, i.e. all of the requirements, 5
                    years at the least is a long time, if one begins younger then one succeeds much
                    more easily. </stress>Though I can work more and am better able to keep clear
                from distractions, and I have no desire for those things which many another craves,
                even so, I notice that I have difficulty learning. And in case I don’t pass, I want
                nevertheless to be sure of having left a sign of life here and there. </p>
            <p>
                <stress reason="career">It’s an amazing amount that one has to know, and even though
                    they try to reassure me, it constantly gives me an indescribably strong feeling
                    of fear, and there’s nothing for it but to get back to work again, for it has
                    been clearly shown that I must do it, no matter what the cost.</stress> Onwards,
                then, because standing still or going downhill are things I’d rather not think
                about. If one did that, one would make things even more difficult and become
                confused, and actually end up having to start all over from the beginning. </p>
            <p> It’s already rather late and I’m really quite tired, for I’ve also walked a lot
                today. What would it be like at Vos’s? At night he probably often has a bad time of
                it, what with coughing and bringing up blood. </p>
            <p> A good letter from home, fortunately it appears that the journey agreed with Pa. I’m
                longing to hear how Anna’s birthday was, in all likelihood she’ll celebrate her next
                one in her own house. </p>
            <p> I wish you the very best and blessings on your work and everything you do, write
                again soon if you can. Give my regards to everyone at the Rooses’, and accept in
                thought a hearty handshake. Goodnight, and believe me </p>

            <p>Tuesday morning. Apropos. Have you sent those maps to Gladwell, i.e. to London?
                Haven’t heard from him lately, and should like to know how he is and what his plans
                are. It’s wonderful weather this morning, must go to Mendes in a little while.</p>

    <letter>
        <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
        <body>
            <p> It’s mainly to tell you that I’m grateful for your visit that I’m writing to you. It
                was quite a long time ago that we saw each other or wrote to each other as we used
                to. All the same, it’s better that we feel something for each other rather than
                behave like corpses towards one another, the more so because as long as one has no
                real right to be called a corpse by being legally dead, it smacks of hypocrisy or at
                least childishness to pose as such. Childish in the manner of a young man of 14
                years who thinks that his dignity and social standing actually oblige him to wear a
                top hat. The hours we spent together in this way have at least assured us that we’re
                both still in the land of the living. <bad_health>When I saw you again and took a
                    walk with you, I had the same feeling I used to have more than I do now, as
                    though life were something good and precious that one should cherish, and I felt
                    more cheerful and alive than I had been for a long time, because in spite of
                    myself life has gradually become or has seemed much less precious to me, much
                    more unimportant and indifferent.</bad_health>
                <bad_health>When one lives with others and is bound by a feeling of affection one is
                    aware that one has a reason for being, that one might not be entirely worthless
                    and superfluous but perhaps good for one thing or another, considering that we
                    need one another and are making the same journey as travelling
                    companions.</bad_health> Proper selfrespect, however, is also very dependent on
                relations with others. </p>
            <p> A prisoner who’s kept in isolation, who’s prevented from working, would in the long
                run, especially if this were to last too long, suffer the consequences just as
                surely as one who went hungry for too long. Like everyone else, <stress
                    reason="friendship">I have need of relationships of friendship or affection or
                    trusting companionship, and am not like a street pump or lamppost, whether of
                    stone or iron, so that I can’t do without them without perceiving an emptiness
                    and feeling their lack,</stress> like any other generally civilized and highly
                respectable man — and I tell you these things to let you know what a salutary effect
                your visit had on me. </p>
            <p> And just as I wished that we not drift apart, this is also the case with regard to
                those at home. Even so, at the moment I really dread going there and am strongly
                inclined to stay here. It could, however, be my fault, and you could be right in
                thinking that I don’t see things straight, which is why it may be that, despite my
                great reluctance and notwithstanding that it’s a hard journey, I’m going to Etten
                for at least a few days. </p>
            <p> As I think back on your visit with thankfulness, our talks naturally come to mind.
                I’ve heard such talks before, many, in fact, and often. Plans for improvement and
                change and raising the spirits — and yet, don’t let it anger you, I’m a little
                afraid of them — also because I sometimes acted upon them and ended up rather
                disappointed. How much has been well thought out that is, however, impracticable. </p>
            <p> The time spent at Amsterdam is still so fresh in my memory. You were there yourself,
                and so you know how the pros and cons were weighed, considered and deliberated upon,
                reasoned with wisdom, how it was well meant — and yet how pitiful the result, how
                daft the whole business, how grossly stupid. I still shudder at the thought. It was
                the worst time I’ve ever gone through. How desirable and appealing the rather
                difficult and troubled days here in this poor country, in these primitive
                surroundings, seem to me compared with then. Something similar, I fear, will be the
                result of following wise counsel given with the best of intentions. </p>
            <p> For such experiences are pretty drastic for me. The damage, the sorrow, the heart’s
                regretfulness is too great for both of us not to have learned the hard way. If we
                don’t learn from this, what shall we then learn from? A striving such as reaching
                the goal set before me, as it was put then, truly that is an ambition that won’t
                easily take hold of me again, the desire to achieve it has cooled considerably, and
                I now look at things from a different perspective, even though it may sound and look
                attractive, and even though it’s unacceptable to think about it as experience taught
                me to think about it. Unacceptable, yes, just as, for example, Francq the Evangelist
                finds it unacceptable that I declared the sermons given by the Rev. Jean Andry to be
                only slightly more evangelical than the sermons of a priest. I would rather die a
                natural death than be prepared for it by the academy, and have occasionally had a
                lesson from a grassmower that seemed to me more useful than one in Greek. </p>
            <p> I<bad_health>mprovement in my life — should I not desire it or should I not be in
                    need of improvement? I really want to improve. But it’s precisely because I
                    yearn for it that I’m afraid of remedies that are worse than the disease. Can
                    you blame a sick person if he looks the doctor straight in the eye and prefers
                    not to be treated wrongly or by a quack?</bad_health>
            </p>
            <p> Does someone who has consumption or typhus do wrong by maintaining that a stronger
                remedy than barley water might be useful or even necessary, or, finding that barley
                water in itself can do no harm, nevertheless doubts its efficacy and potency in his
                particular case? </p>
            <p> The doctor who prescribed barley water mustn’t say, this patient is a stubborn
                person who is set upon his own ruin because he doesn’t want to take medicine — no,
                because the man is not unwilling, but the socalled medicine was unsuitable, because
                it was indeed ‘it’ but still not yet ‘it’ at all. </p>
            <p> Do you blame someone if he fails to be moved by a painting which is recorded in the
                catalogue as a Memling but which has nothing to do with Memling other than that it’s
                a similar subject from the Gothic period but without artistic value? </p>
            <p> And if you should now assume from what I’ve said that I intended to say you were a
                quack because of your advice then you will have completely misunderstood me, since I
                have no such idea or opinion of you. </p>
            <p> If, on the other hand, you think that I thought I would do well to take your advice
                literally and become a lithographer of invoice headings and visiting cards, or a
                bookkeeper or a carpenter’s apprentice — likewise that of my very dear sister Anna
                to devote myself to the baker’s trade or many other things of that kind (quite
                remarkably diverse and mutually exclusive) — which it was suggested I pursue, you
                would also be mistaken. But, you say, I’m not giving you this advice for you to
                follow to the letter, but because I thought you had a taste for idling and because I
                was of the opinion that you should put an end to it. </p>
            <p>
                <stress reason="friendship">Might I be allowed to point out to you that such idling
                    is really a rather strange sort of idling. It’s rather difficult for me to
                    defend myself on this score, but I would be sorry if you couldn’t eventually see
                    this in a different light. I also don’t know if I would do well to counter such
                    accusations by following the advice to become a baker, for example. That would
                    really be a sufficient answer (supposing it were possible for us to assume the
                    guise of a baker or haircutter or librarian with lightning speed) and yet
                    actually a foolish response, rather like the way the man acted who, when accused
                    of heartlessness because he was sitting on a donkey, immediately dismounted and
                    continued on his way with the donkey on his shoulders</stress>. </p>
            <p> And, joking apart, I honestly think it would be better if the relationship between
                us were more trusting on both sides. <stress reason="friendship">If I must seriously
                    feel that I’m annoying or burdensome to you or those at home, useful for neither
                    one thing nor another, and were to go on being forced to feel like an intruder
                    or a fifth wheel in your presence, so that it would be better I weren’t there,
                    and if I should have to continue trying to keep further and further out of other
                    people’s way</stress> — <bad_health>if I think that indeed it would be so and
                    cannot be otherwise, then I’m overcome by a feeling of sorrow and I must
                    struggle against despair. </bad_health></p>
            <p>
                <bad_health>It’s difficult for me to bear these thoughts and more difficult still to
                    bear the thought that so much discord, misery and sorrow, in our midst and in
                    our family, has been caused by me.</bad_health>
            </p>
            <p>
                <bad_health>If it were indeed so, then I’d truly wish that it be granted me not to
                    have to go on living too long. </bad_health>Yet whenever this depresses me
                beyond measure, all too deeply, after a long time the thought also occurs to me:
                    <bad_health>it’s perhaps only a bad, terrible dream, and later we’ll perhaps
                    learn to understand and comprehend it better.</bad_health> But is it not, after
                all, reality, and won’t it one day become better rather than worse? To many it would
                no doubt appear foolish and superstitious to believe in any improvement for the
                better. Sometimes in winter it’s so bitterly cold that one says, it’s simply too
                cold, what do I care whether summer comes, the bad outweighs the good.
                    <bad_health>But whether we like it or not, an end finally comes to the hard
                    frost, and one fine morning the wind has turned and we have a thaw. Comparing
                    the natural state of the weather with our state of mind and our circumstances,
                    subject to variableness and change, I still have some hope that it can
                    improve</bad_health>. </p>
            <p>
                <bad_health>If you write, soon perhaps, you will make me happy.</bad_health> Just in
                case, address your letter care of J.Bte Denis, rue du PetitWasmes à Wasmes
                (Hainaut). </p>
            <p> Walked to Wasmes after your departure that evening. Have since drawn a portrait. </p>

        <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
        <body>
            <p> It’s Sunday evening, and I want to write a few words again, for I also really long
                to get another letter from you, do write again soon, I am with you so often in
                thought. I sincerely hope that you’ve had a good Sunday. </p>
            <p>
                <good_health>As you know, Pa was here and I’m very glad of it, we went together to
                    Mendes, Uncle Stricker, Uncle Cor, Vos and Kee and both Meijjes families, and
                    the most pleasant memory of Pa’s visit is that morning we spent together in my
                    study, looking over my work and talking about all sorts of things.</good_health>
                You can imagine that those days flew by and when, after bringing Pa to the station
                and watching the train or even only the smoke for as long as it was in sight,
                    <bad_health>I came back to my room and Pa’s chair was standing there by the
                    little desk on which the books and notebooks were still lying from the day
                    before, even though I know that we’ll see each other again quite soon, I broke
                    down and cried like a child.</bad_health>
            </p>
            <p> You’ll already have heard that Mendes made a favourable impression on Pa as well. In
                the evening, at Uncle Cor’s, we saw drawings and books, including Doré’s Bible and
                Bida’s Le livre de Ruth and Histoire de Joseph. </p>
            <p>
                <unstress reason="friendship">Was in the English church this morning and met Wierda
                    upon leaving the church, who had been there too. We went for a walk together and
                    he asked me if I’d like to come and see his room,</unstress> he lives in
                Weteringstraat, about 10 minutes from Leidsestraat. I told him that for a long time
                I had wanted to see his room and where and how he lived, so <unstress
                    reason="friendship">I went along and after drinking coffee I stayed till around
                    3 o’clock and saw his books and heard a thing or two about his life, where he
                    had been previously and so on</unstress>, first he was in Bolsward, then in
                Haarlem and then here. He has worked hard in his life and will probably continue to
                do so and not give it up easily. Afterwards, at home, translated a passage from
                Caesar, and this afternoon to Uncle Stricker’s, I go there rather often now that
                Uncle is out of town and now that it’s lonely again here in the house since Pa left.
                This evening they went to see Vos, who isn’t any better. </p>
            <p> I still have to congratulate you on Pa’s birthday, even though it’s already been and
                gone, it will have been a good day, with Anna there too, I’m longing for a letter
                from home to hear how they celebrated that day. Anna was slightly indisposed and
                hadn’t yet recovered completely, she wrote in a letter that Pa received here.
                Perhaps Pa read Ma’s letter aloud to you, which she wrote while Pa was here, it told
                about a visit to a sick person which sounded like something out of Adam Bede.It’s
                foggy here today, fortunately Pa had good weather so that we could walk quite a lot. </p>
            <p> I’m reminding you of that piece by Jules Breton, not that there’s any hurry, but try
                and remember it sometime. </p>
            <p> Because in March you’ll probably make the trip again, won’t you, and also come here
                again? </p>
            <p> Uncle Jan will most likely come back on Tuesday. </p>
            <p> You’ll certainly have a lot to do at the beginning of the year, like most people.
                Wierda, too, unburdened himself on that score this morning. </p>
            <p>
                <stress reason="career">For me, too, things are beginning to get more and more
                    serious as the exam approaches.</stress>
                <good_health>I’ll be glad when it grows light a bit earlier in the morning and we’re
                    already beginning to get used to it.</good_health>
            </p>
            <p> Did Pa remember to give you the photograph of the Maris? The woodcut after Van
                Goyen, Dordrecht, is hanging in its place. Went recently to see that painting again
                here in the museum, it is good through and through. The next time you come here I’d
                like to look through the etchings by Dürer here in the museum again, as we did with
                Rembrandt’s last time. </p>
            <p> It’s no doubt beautiful in Scheveningen on these grey days, do you still go there
                quite often? Perhaps it’s like that painting by Ruisdael in the museum in The Hague.
                Do you have the lithograph of it that was once in the Kunstkronijk? It’s really
                good. </p>
            <p> How are things going at Mauve’s? Very well, I hope. Have you been there recently? </p>
            <p> I’m currently taking lessons from Uncle Stricker once or twice a week, that is a
                bonus. Uncle is an expert in it, and I’m glad he could find the time to do it. </p>
            <p> Now, old boy, a hearty handshake in thought, I’ll set to work, give my regards to
                your housemates, and also to Mauve if you run into him, I wish you the very best,
                write soon, also congratulations on Anna’s birthday, even though it’s still to come,
                and believe me ever</p>

        <salutation>&gt;My dear Theo,</salutation>
        <body>
            <p> It’s time you received a few words from me, Pa already wrote that you’ve arrived
                safely and have already written how you roamed around the city the first few days.
                I’m really longing to hear what your impressions are of this and that, and that’s
                why I urge you to write a few words as soon as you can find the time. It’s true,
                though, that first impressions don’t last, for we know all too well that all that
                glitters is not gold, and that when there is a friendly dawn there is a midnight
                too, and scorching and oppressive heat in the afternoon. But just as the morning
                hour is a blessed hour and the early bird catches the worm, so it is with first
                impressions, and they have their value even though they pass, for it is they which
                later appear to have been correct, and one comes back to them. The first thing that
                attracts and strikes a child is the light, and an old man also searches again
                fearfully for it. So write and tell me what you saw during those first few days, and
                what you thought. </p>
            <p>
                <stress reason="family">You’ll have heard that Lies didn’t pass her exam and has
                    fallen ill, and that because she longed so much for home, Ma went to fetch her,
                    poor girl, it will be no small disappointment for her and for everyone at home,
                    and yesterday was perhaps a less cheerful Sunday.</stress> Pa nevertheless wrote
                again, and in his mouth that is the truth, that with all disappointment and at every
                serious moment of life, faith becomes more alive and stronger. </p>
            <p><unstress reason="environment"> The weather has been beautiful here the last few
                    days, and probably in Paris too. You’ll soon notice that in the summer it’s at
                    times rather warmer there than it is here, and you’ll probably see stormy skies
                    like those Bonington painted.</unstress> It’s really a nice neighbourhood where
                you live. If one roams the streets there, whether in the morning or evening, or
                walks in the direction of Montmartre, one is struck by many workshops and many rooms
                that recall ‘a cooper’ or The seamstresses or other paintings by E. Frère, and it
                does one good sometimes to see such things, which are simple, as one occasionally
                sees a good many people who for various reasons have strayed a long way from
                everything that is natural, thereby throwing away their true and inner lives, and
                also many who are rooted in misery and loathsome things, because in the evening and
                at night one sees all manner of those dark figures walking about, both men and
                women, who personify, as it were, the terror of the night, and whose misery must be
                classified among the things that have no name in any language. </p>
            <p>
                <stress reason="friendship">Vos isn’t well, he has coughed up blood again more than
                    once. </stress>Was there recently one afternoon when he was up, sitting hand in
                hand with Kee, both of them dressed in black and their faces equally pale, looking
                out of the window at the Church and the trees across the street, when there was a
                dark stormy sky and the leaves and the dust were whirling around in a strange way
                and the pavingstones looked so much whiter than usual, and the little black figures
                of the people stood out against them so much more sharply, as is often the case
                before a thunderstorm. He has become so much paler and thinner than when you saw
                him, and sometimes looks like a ghost. It has become a veritable house of mourning,
                and Uncle Stricker’s too, in fact, for when one member suffers, all the members
                suffer with it, for they have been planted together. </p>
            <p> Last week one of the ministers here died who was very well known throughout the
                country (Pantekoek). The funeral was on Saturday, it was something that reminded one
                of ‘In memoriam’, that procession along the path by the green borders of the Amstel.
                He was the father of 6 children, the eldest around 20. A very large crowd followed,
                literally jostling one another. Yesterday there were sermons occasioned by the event
                in nearly every church. Heard Uncle Stricker, among others, who had been a close
                acquaintance of his. It was his turn to preach in the Oudezijdskapel, where the boys
                from the orphanage and those from the nautical college usually go. There was a lot
                of spirit in it, spoke, among other things, of the words: Now is my soul troubled;
                and what shall I say? It was a long and terrible suffering that was his lot. Heard
                one of his last sermons one evening, and even then it was clearly evident from what
                he said that he trembled at and recoiled from each new day and night, and especially
                from one that followed upon the effort of preaching. Even then one couldn’t hear him
                without feeling for him, as it were, and one couldn’t help shuddering, for it is a
                dark path, the one to his long home, and happy is he who, when that darkness and
                night are approaching, is strengthened even then by the hope for a better life and
                the resurrection as we know befell Mary Magdalen and Him Whom she supposed to be the
                gardener in the garden by the sepulchre, by the hope: who knows what shall be on the
                morrow? Saw his son yesterday at the early service, if one can compare the faces of
                people with other faces, then his looks very much like an eagle, especially then,
                when he was stricken by what had just happened. </p>
            <p> You must try to read some beautiful book or other over there, by Michelet, for
                instance, on the Revolution or something by Thoré or T. Gautier on Paris and the
                time of the young painters and writers. Oh, old boy, how I’d like to roam through
                the city with you. </p>
            <p> Hope to take a long walk today through a neighbourhood I haven’t seen much of yet. I
                found the house in Breestraat where Rembrandt lived. We talked about it, you know,
                when you were here. </p>
            <p> Don’t forget about that painting in the Luxembourg, He that receiveth you receiveth
                me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me, and write and tell me who
                made it. </p>
            <p> It can be so glorious in Paris in the autumn, well, you’ll be seeing something of it
                at the end of September. </p>
            <p> Give my warm regards to everyone at the Soeks’, I still think so often of an
                excursion I made with his family to Villed’Avray. Going into the church there, it
                struck me that there was, I believe, even more than one painting by Corot hanging
                there. You know that he spent a lot of time there. </p>
            <p>Bid goodday to Braat, and Mutters too. I wish you well, and write soon, and accept in
                thought a hearty handshake, and believe me ever</p>

        <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
        <body>
            <p> I heard from Pa and Ma that they were recently surprised by a visit from you, just
                when Pa had returned from here. <good_health>I’m very glad that Pa was
                    here.</good_health> Together we visited the 3 ministers of the Borinage and
                walked through the snow and visited a miner’s family and saw coal being hauled up
                from a mine called Les trois Diefs (the three heaps of earth) and Pa attended two
                Bible readings, so we did a great deal in those couple of days. I believe that Pa
                received an impression of the Borinage that he won’t easily forget, as it would be
                with anyone who visited this singular, remarkable and picturesque region of the
                country. </p>
            <p> It’s been a long time since I wrote to you. If, with God’s blessing, I succeed in
                getting settled here, then you must come here sometime, perhaps when you have to go
                to Paris again, or tying it in with a business trip. </p>
            <p> I recently found in the house of an elderly man who had worked in the mines for many
                years a list of all the seams of coal south of Mons, which are 155 in number. The
                country and the people here appeal to me more each day, one has here a familiar
                feeling as though on the heath or in the dunes, there’s something simple and
                kindhearted about the people. Those who have left here are homesick for their
                country, just as, conversely, foreigners who are homesick may come to feel at home
                here.How are Mauve and Maris? Have you seen a lot lately? The spring that is
                beginning will renew and change their subject matter. What did Israëls make this
                winter? How much they would notice here that would make an impression on them! When
                the cart with a white horse (l’blanc ch’val) brings an injured man home from the
                mine, one sees things that remind one of Israëls’s shipwreck, and over and over
                again there is something that moves one. </p>
            <p> Write a few words soon, and remember that if you tell me about the painters, I still
                understand something of it, even though it’s been a long time since I’ve seen many
                paintings. </p>
            <p>
                <good_health>Have rented a small house where I’d really like to live entirely on my
                    own, but which now serves only as a workplace or study, because Pa thinks it
                    better that I board with Denis, and I do too. I have prints on the wall there
                    and all sorts of things.</good_health>
            </p>
            <p> I have to go out and visit the sick as well as the healthy. Write soon, and I wish
                you the very best. </p>
            <p> Give my regards to Mauve, if you see him, and to your housemates. </p>
            <p> Spring is beginning, for one hears larks here, and in the woods the branches and
                buds are beginning to sprout, especially the alders, but when Pa was here everything
                was covered with snow, so that Pa saw the singular effect of the black coalpits and
                the many black chimneys in the snow. There are many places here that remind one of
                that drawing by Bosboom, Chaudfontaine. </p>

    <letter>
        <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
        <body>
            <p>I came across the following sentence that you’d underlined in the article on Chardin
                in De Goncourt’s book. After speaking about painters being badly paid, he says:
                ‘What to do, what to become. He must abandon himself to the inferior occupations or
                die of hunger. The first course is adopted’. So, he goes on to say, aside from a few
                martyrs, the rest ‘become fencing masters, soldiers or comedians’.</p>
            <p>That really has remained fundamentally true. Seeing as you’d marked the above, I
                considered it possible you might want to know what I intend to do next, especially
                since I’ve just informed you that I’ve given notice on my current studio.</p>
            <p>The present day isn’t entirely the same as Chardin’s, and nowadays there are a few
                things that are hard to argue away. The number of painters is much greater.</p>
            <p>Now it immediately makes a fatal impression on the public if a painter ‘does
                something on the side’. I’m not at all above that in this respect, I should say keep
                on painting, make a hundred studies, and if that’s not enough, two hundred, and just
                see if that doesn’t get you over ‘doing something on the side’. Then accustoming
                yourself to poverty, seeing how a soldier or a labourer lives and stays healthy in
                wind and weather with the ordinary people’s food and dwelling, is as practical as
                earning a guilder or a bit more a week. After all, one’s not in the world for one’s
                comfort and doesn’t have to be any better off than the next man. Being better off
                helps hardly at all — after all, we can’t hold on to our youth.</p>
            <p>If that were possible — but the thing that really makes one happy, being young and
                staying so for a long time — well, that isn’t here — that isn’t even in Arabia or
                Italy, although that is better there than here.And for my part, I’m of the opinion
                that one has the greatest chance of staying strong and renewing oneself — in today’s
                third estate. Anyway. So I’m saying that I seek to find it in painting, without
                ulterior motives. <stress reason="money">But — I’d do well, I think, to bear
                    portrait painting in mind if I want to earn.</stress> I know it’s difficult to
                please people with a ‘likeness’, and I dare not say beforehand that I feel sure of
                my case. I certainly don’t consider it altogether impossible, though, because the
                people here will be much the same as people elsewhere. Well then, the peasants and
                the folk from the village aren’t mistaken and promptly say, even contradicting me if
                I say they’re wrong, that is Renier de Greef, that’s Toon de Groot and that’s Dien
                van der Beek (and);c. And sometimes even recognize a figure seen from behind. In
                town, the bourgeois folk, and certainly no less the tarts, no matter who they are,
                always value portraits. And Millet — discovered that ship’s captains actually
                ‘respect someone for it’ if he can do that (those portraits are probably intended
                for their mistresses ashore). This hasn’t been exploited yet. Do you remember this
                in Sensier? I’ve always remembered how Millet kept himself going in Le Havre this
                way.Well roughly, my plan is to go to Antwerp — I can’t possibly calculate the ins
                and outs beforehand.</p>
            <p>I’ve come by the addresses of 6 art dealers, so I’d want to take something with me
                and further, as to the work, I plan to paint a few views of the city as soon as I
                get there — reasonably large — — and show them straightaway too.</p>
            <p>
                <stress reason="career">In other words concentrate everything on doing something
                    there. And going there poor, at any rate I can’t lose much.</stress>
            </p>
            <p>Now as regards here — I know the area and the folk too well and love them too much to
                believe I’m going for good. I’ll see about renting a place to store my things, and
                then I’m also covered should I want to leave Antwerp for a while — or should become
                homesick for the country.</p>
            <p>As for ‘doing something on the side’ — right from the outset Tersteeg, for instance,
                nagged me about it. And that was nagging, whatever else one may think of Tersteeg.
                Those who talk about it the most aren’t at the same time able to explain precisely
                what. And as to that, in order to clear the whole thing up in my case — if I did
                ‘something on the side’, then the only thing would be that, if I knew either dealers
                or painters, I would possibly do something with paintings, for instance by going to
                England for them .</p>
            <p>Things like this, which are obviously directly related to painting, are an exception,
                but otherwise, as a rule, a painter must be wholly a painter.Don’t forget, either,
                that I’m not cut out to be a melancholic. The nickname I have around here is
                generally ‘the little painter fellow’, and it’s not entirely without a measure of
                malice that I’m going there. I’ve also thought of Drenthe, though, but as more
                difficult to bring about.</p>
            <p>That would be good, though, should my work from the countryside be liked in Antwerp.
                If the things from here were liked, either now or later, then I would continue with
                them, and vary them with similar things from Drenthe.</p>
            <p>But the issue is that I can only do one thing at a time, that if I’m engaged in
                painting peasants, I can’t occupy myself with business in town. <stress
                    reason="money">The present moment is ideal for breaking away, since I’ve had
                    trouble getting models and am going to move in any case.</stress> As to that,
                it’s to be expected that there would never be an end to it in this studio right next
                door to the priest and the sacristan. So I’m changing that.But anyway, it doesn’t
                make an absolute impression on people, and by renting another room and letting
                things lie for a few months, the intrigue will lose a great deal of its force.
                Wouldn’t it be best if I could spend the next couple of months, December and
                January, there? In Amsterdam I lodged in a soup kitchen for 50 cents; I’d do the
                same there, or better yet reach agreement with some painter or other to be allowed
                to work in his studio. There’s another reason, too — that it’s not absolutely
                impossible I might find an opportunity somewhere to paint from the nude.</p>
            <p>They wouldn’t want me at the academy, nor probably would I — but — with a sculptor,
                say, there must surely be a few living there, one might readily find some sympathy.
                    <stress reason="money">It goes without saying that people with money can get as
                    many models as they want, but it’s a difficult matter without it. All the same,
                    there must be people there who use nude models and with whom one could split the
                    cost. I need it for many things.</stress>I received your letter while I was
                writing to you. I’m willing to go to Van de Loo if need be, only you know that
                doctors sometimes don’t tell you everything, particularly in doubtful cases. You
                should also understand that what I said about her being rather in a fog will
                probably recur, is a thing that most people who are getting old have. In any event I
                think it a very practical idea not to let her stay in the midst of the upheaval of
                the removal, unless she absolutely insists. For the rest, old chap, for my part I
                believe that Van de Loo has given Ma all, absolutely all the advice there was to
                give, and would say nothing new. I mean, he would already have given a warning if a
                danger that could be averted were threatening. But if he doesn’t say anything it’s a
                sign that, if there were something, he can’t do anything about it and nothing should
                be done about it; if he’s letting nature take its course, he’s doing it because
                that’s the best thing — Van de Loo is enormously scrupulous and — Zola-like cool and
                calm. Anyhow — I’ll speak to Wil about it, and either I may go there or Ma may come
                across Van de Loo sometime when he’s in the village; we’ll do something. But I think
                it will just have to take its course. Now in such cases, you’ll agree with me,
                worrying and being overanxious is intolerable for the patient if she notices it. And
                with old people there’s often no way of predicting it, precisely because in so many
                cases their hearts aren’t normal, because of fatty degeneration, say, and they can
                just as easily go off suddenly as carry on for another 5, another 10 years. Emotion
                can have an effect, of course, but precisely because of this there’s much more
                chance of staying alive if the mind is no longer all too clear, than in periods of
                lucidity. Something else — I’m quite sure that, from time to time at least, there’s
                definitely a substratum of deep thoughts in Ma (for her inner life, her life of the
                mind is fairly complicated and has levels or layers) that she neither wants to nor
                could express. In many cases she was rather silent, so — I for one would rather say
                that I don’t always know everything about her. Particularly now that she’s lucid,
                letting her do as she wants is certainly the easiest, firstly for her and secondly
                the most sensible for us.Silently understanding how it would by no means be a
                misfortune for her were it to be that she didn’t live very much longer and departed
                without much suffering, serenity is justifiable in this regard. Serenity too,
                though, were it to be that years of relatively mechanical life remained.</p>
            <p>You see that I wanted to arrange my going to Antwerp at around the same time as their
                trip, which will be over around February. Between then and their final move, I’ll
                either be back in Nuenen or — if something exceptional detained me longer,
                nonetheless always ready to be present right away if something happened.</p>
            <p>This must go off, but I’ll write in a few days and tell you what I’ve arranged with
                Wil. I’ll suggest she goes to Van de Loo with Ma before the trip; that would go
                without saying for Ma. Once Van de Loo has seen her, that will be the moment for
                either Wil or me to ask Van de Loo outright whether he can say anything about her
                life expectancy. For my part, depending on what you and Wil think about it, I’m
                willing to prepare Van de Loo before Ma’s visit, and tell him what we’d like to
                know, so that he gives her a really thorough examination. </p>

        <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
        <body>
            <p> It’s time that you hear something from me again. I heard from home that you were in
                Etten for a couple of days and that you were travelling for the firm. I sincerely
                hope that your trip went well. </p>
            <p> These days you’ll no doubt be in the dunes and in Scheveningen now and then.
                    <unstress reason="environment">Here it’s also attractive in the country in the
                    spring; here and there are places where one could imagine oneself in the dunes,
                    because of the hills.</unstress>
            </p>
            <p> I went on a very interesting excursion not long ago; the fact is, I spent 6 hours in
                a mine. </p>
            <p> In one of the oldest and most dangerous mines in the area no less, called Marcasse.
                This mine has a bad name because many die in it, whether going down or coming up, or
                by suffocation or gas exploding, or because of water in the ground, or because of
                old passageways caving in and so on. It’s a sombre place, and at first sight
                everything around it has something dismal and deathly about it. The workers there
                are usually people, emaciated and pale owing to fever, who look exhausted and
                haggard, weatherbeaten and prematurely old, the women generally sallow and withered.
                All around the mine are poor miners’ dwellings with a couple of dead trees,
                completely black from the smoke, and thornhedges, dungheaps and rubbish dumps,
                mountains of unusable coal. Maris would make a beautiful painting of it. </p>
            <p>
                <work origin="new" stage="planned">Later I’ll try and make a sketch of it to give
                    you an idea of it. </work>Had a good guide, a man who has already worked there
                for 33 years, a friendly and patient man who explained everything clearly and tried
                to make it understandable. </p>
            <p> We went down together, 700 metres deep this time, and went into the most hidden
                corners of that underworld. </p>
            <p> The maintenages or gradins (cells where the miners work) that are farthest removed
                from the exit are called ‘des caches’ (hidden places, places where one searches).
                This mine has 5 levels, 3 of which, the uppermost ones, are exhausted and abandoned,
                one no longer works in them because there’s no more coal. If anyone were to try and
                make a painting of the maintenages, that would be something new and something
                unheardof or rather neverbeforeseen. Imagine a series of cells in a rather narrow
                and low passageway, supported by rough timberwork. In each of the cells is a worker
                in a coarse linen suit, dingy and soiled as a chimneysweep, chipping away at the
                coal by the dim light of a small lamp. In some of the cells the worker stands
                upright, in others (‘seams worked lying down’) he lies flat on the ground. </p>
            <p> The arrangement is more or less like the cells in a beehive, or like a dark, sombre
                passageway in an underground prison, or like a series of small looms, or actually
                they look like a row of ovens such as one sees among the peasants, or like the
                separate tombs in a vault. The passageways themselves are like the large chimneys of
                the Brabant farmsteads. </p>
            <p> In some, water leaks in everywhere and the light of the miner’s lamp creates a
                peculiar effect and reflects as in a cave full of stalactites. Some of the miners
                work in the maintenages, others load the loosened coal into small wagons that are
                transported along rails resembling a tramway. It’s mostly children who do this, both
                boys and girls. There’s also a stable there, 700 metres below ground, with around 7
                old horses that transport larger amounts, bringing them to the socalled accrochage,
                that being the place where they’re hauled up. Other workers are busy restoring the
                antiquated passageways to prevent them from caving in, or are making new passageways
                in the coal seam. Just as sailors on land are homesick for the sea, despite all the
                dangers and difficulties that threaten them, so the mineworker would rather be below
                ground than above. </p>
            <p> The villages here have something forsaken and still and extinct about them, because
                life goes on underground instead of above. One could be here for years, but unless
                one has been down in the mines one has no clear picture of what goes on here. </p>
            <p> The people here are very uneducated and ignorant, and most of them can’t read, yet
                they’re shrewd and nimble in their difficult work, courageous, of rather small build
                but squareshouldered, with sombre, deepset eyes. They’re skilled at many things and
                work amazingly hard. Very nervous dispositions, I mean not weak but sensitive. Have
                a festering and deeprooted hatred and an innate distrust of anyone who tries to boss
                them around. With charcoalburners one must have a charcoalburner’s nature and
                character, and no pretensions, pridefulness or imperiousness, otherwise one can’t
                get on with them and could never win their trust.Did I tell you at the time about
                the miner who was badly burned by a gas explosion? Thank God he has now recovered
                and goes out and about and is beginning to take long walks as practice, his hands
                are still weak and it will be some time before he’s able to use them for his work,
                yet he has been saved. But since then there have been quite a few cases of typhus
                and virulent fever, including what is known as ‘foolish fever’, which causes one to
                have bad dreams such as nightmares and delirium. So there are again many sickly and
                bedridden people, lying emaciated on their beds, weak and miserable. </p>
            <p> In one house everyone is sick with fever, and they have little or no help, which
                means that there the sick are taking care of the sick. ‘Here it is the sick who
                nurse the sick,’ said the woman, just as it is the poor who befriend the poor. </p>
            <p> Have you seen anything beautiful recently? I’m eagerly longing for a letter from
                you. </p>
            <p> Has Israëls been working a lot lately, and Maris and Mauve? </p>
            <p> A couple of nights ago a foal was born in the stable here, a nice small creature
                that was quick to stand firmly on its feet. The workers keep a lot of goats here,
                and there are young ones in the houses everywhere, just like the rabbits commonly to
                be found in the workers’ houses. </p>
            <p> Must go out and visit the sick, so have to finish now, let me hear from you soon, to
                give a sign of life, should you have the time. </p>
            <p> Give my regards to your housemates, and to Mauve when you get the chance, I wish you
                the very best, and believe me ever, with a handshake in thought, </p>

            <p>Going down in a mine is an unpleasant business, in a kind of basket or cage like a
                bucket in a well, but then a well 500700 metres deep, so that down there, looking
                upward, the daylight appears to be about as big as a star in the sky. One has a
                feeling similar to one’s first time on a ship at sea, but worse, though fortunately
                it doesn’t last long. The workers get used to it, but even so, they never shake off
                an unconquerable feeling of horror and dread that stays with them, not without
                reason or unjustifiably. Once down there, however, it isn’t so bad, and the effort
                is richly rewarded by what one sees.</p>

    <letter>
        <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
        <body>
            <p> I’m enclosing a note in the letter from Pa and Ma; was glad to hear things are still
                going well for you there, and that you also continue to enjoy life. How much I’d
                like to walk with you there. </p>
            <p> As Pa has certainly already written to you, Pa and I went to Brussels last week in
                the company of the Rev. Jones of Isleworth, who stayed here over Sunday. The
                impression we brought home from that journey was satisfactory inasmuch as we think
                that, with time, a place and position can be found there — that the road is most
                certainly shorter and less expensive than in Holland, and that it’s therefore best
                to fix our eyes on Belgium and to go on looking there until we find something. </p>
            <p> We saw the Flemish training college, it has a 3year course while, as you know, in
                Holland the study would take another 6 years at the very least. And one is not even
                required to complete the training before competing for a place and position as an
                Evangelist. What is required is the talent to give easy, warmhearted and popular
                lectures or speeches to the people, better short and to the point than long and
                learned. So less attention is paid to great knowledge of ancient languages and much
                theological study, although everything one knows about such things is a great
                recommendation, and more consideration is given to one’s suitability for practical
                work and one’s natural faith. <stress reason="career">We aren’t there yet, though,
                    first of all because one doesn’t suddenly possess, nor can one acquire it except
                    by much practice, the gift of speaking to the people with earnestness and
                    feeling and without stiffness and forcedness, but naturally and as though
                    constrained by love and as a master of his subject matter, knowing how to say
                    what one has to say to the people clearly and understandably, while what one has
                    to say must have meaning and import and strong grounds to whet his listeners’
                    interest in it, that they shall endeavour to let their affections take root in
                    truth.</stress> In a word, one must be a lay preacher to succeed over
                there.Those gentlemen in Brussels wanted me to come there for a period of 3 months
                to make closer acquaintance, but in the long run this, too, would be costly, and
                that must be avoided as much as possible. It’s for this reason that at present I
                shall continue here in Etten to do some work as preparation, going from here from
                time to time to pay a visit to the Rev. Pieterszen in Mechelen or the Rev. De Jonge
                in Brussels, in so doing becoming more closely acquainted with one another. </p>
            <p> How long things go on like this depends entirely on what else they’ll say over
                there. Both Pa and I have just written to them again. </p>
            <p> Pa wants me to write, to the best of my ability, a theme or two to have on hand
                    (<work origin="new" stage="middle">I’m now busy, for instance, on Rembrandt’s
                    painting ‘The carpenter’s house’ in the Louvr</work>e). </p>
            <p> Yesterday Pa had to preach at Zundert, and I went along. The Aunts sent you their
                regards, we also went to C. van Ginneken who, as you’ve probably heard, is going to
                marry Marie van Mens and has bought the Ropsentuin to put a tannery there. </p>
            <p> Was also at Jan Doomen’s, who has been suffering a lot from rheumatism in his leg,
                and complains that he wouldn’t even be able to walk to Breda any more, but it didn’t
                bother him so much working in the field or the garden, only in the morning the pain
                drove him to get up very early. Old age is accompanied by ailments, the old Rev.
                Meijjes would say. </p>
            <p> What an outstandingly beautiful wood engraving of ‘A young citizen of the year V’ by
                Jules Goupil was recently published in L’Illustration! Have you seen it? Have
                managed to get hold of one and it’s now hanging on the wall of the little room here
                where I’m allowed to take up residence, i.e. the classroom that looks out on the
                garden and against which the ivy grows. But regarding that painting, the magazine
                said this: ‘Eyes that have seen the spectacle of the dreadful guillotine, a mind
                that has survived all the sights of the Revolution. He is almost surprised to find
                himself still alive after so many disasters’. </p>
            <p> It was a remarkable presence in art and will continue to have a similar effect on
                many and continue to make a deep impression on those with a feeling for high art,
                like a portrait by Fabritius or some other rather mystical paintings from the school
                of Rembrandt. </p>
            <p>
                <unstress reason="environment">In the evening, when we rode back from Zundert over
                    the heath, Pa and I walked a way, the sun set red behind the pines and the
                    evening sky was reflected in the marshes, the heath and the yellow and white and
                    grey sand were so resonant with tone and atmosphere.</unstress>
                <good_health>You see, there are moments in life when everything, within us too, is
                    peace and atmosphere, and all of life seems to be like a path across the heath,
                    though it isn’t always so.</good_health>
            </p>
            <p> And this morning Cor, who’s on holiday, and I went to the heath and the pinewood
                again, a way past Molenend, and went to fetch heather for his rabbits, which are
                apparently very fond of it, for it’s their natural food for a good part, as well as
                a thing or two to fill a flower basket. We sat for a while in the pinewood, and
                together we drew a map of Etten and its surroundings with the Bremberg and Haansberg
                and ’t Slagveld and Geestestraat and Sprundel and Het Heike and Hoeven. </p>
            <p> Anna is but poorly, she’s so quiet and sometimes looks so very weak — poor sister —
                it seems to me that it’s better to be well and truly married than to be engaged, and
                I should sincerely wish for her sake that she were already safely three years or so
                further along in life — may God spare her and protect her from all evil, He about
                Whom it is written that He is our Keeper and our Shade upon our right hand. </p>
            <p> Would you give my warm regards to Soek and all his family (if you happen to go
                there), also to Frans Braat and Ernest and the others if the opportunity should
                arise? I think about you a lot and am so glad that things are going well for you and
                that you’re finding things over there that stimulate you and are, as it were, good
                food for the true life. That too is high art, as are the works of those who work
                with their heart and with their mind and spirit, just as so many you know and will
                perhaps meet personally, whose words and works are spirit and life. That you too,
                and, if possible, all of us may become more and more rooted and grounded in that
                same principle, so that our affections take root in truth, this is wished you with a
                hearty handshake in thought by </p>

            <p> I’m writing to you in haste. Won’t you be going to Paris quite soon now? If so,
                write and tell me which day and what time, and in all likelihood I’ll see you at the
                station. If you have time to stay here for a day, or longer or shorter, I sincerely
                wish that this could happen. </p>
            <p> Would be able to show you some drawings, types from here, not that they alone make
                it worth your while to get off the train, but <unstress reason="environment">here
                    you would easily find something that appeals to you in the scenery and in the
                    singularity of everything, for there’s so much picturesque character in
                    everything in this region.</unstress> Have you ever read Dickens, ‘Les temps
                difficiles’, I’m giving you the title in French because there’s a very good French
                translation for 1.25 francs published by Hachette, Bibliothèque des meilleurs romans
                étranger. It’s masterly, one of the characters is a worker, Stephen Blackpool, who’s
                well portrayed and extremely likeable. </p>

            <p> Was recently in a studio, the Rev. Pieterszen’s, who paints in the style of

        <body>
            <p> I’m enclosing a few words with Pa and Ma’s letter to bid you good morning. It’s
                raining outside and has done so a lot lately, with strong winds too. It was nice the
                day Anna and Joan registered their banns. Now that Joan is here, Anna looks a lot
                more cheerful and better than before. For their honeymoon they’re thinking of making
                a journey through Belgium, first to Brussels and from there probably south to Liège
                or Chaudfontaine or the cave in Han. Wrote and told the Rev. De Jonge that I was
                ready to come to Brussels straightaway if work or duty should call me, but that if
                there were no sound reasons that made it desirable for me to go there now, I’d like
                to stay here another week (because of Anna’s wedding), coming in that case before
                Sunday, 25 Aug. I’m very curious to know whether the exhibition of paintings there
                will still be open, I should so much like to see it. </p>
            <p>
                <stress reason="family">Things are very sad at Princenhage, Aunt suffers a lot, and
                    they’re all very worried about her.</stress>
            </p>
            <p> I long for a word from you, hope to write to you in more detail as soon as I’m in
                Brussels, also about the exhibition, at least if it isn’t over yet. </p>
            <p> Give my regards to Braat and Soek, if you see them, and Ernest. Adieu, I wish you
                the very best, not a day goes by that we don’t speak of you. Do write again soon,
                and accept a hearty handshake in thought from </p>

            <p>I’ll tell you in a few words what Van de Loo said about Ma. He says</p>
            <p>1) that there’s nothing wrong with her</p>
            <p>2) that she can live for another 10 years or so</p>
            <p>3) that if she dies before that time, then she would have to have contracted some
                disease or other.</p>
            <p>Lastly, he seemed to find it very natural that she was sometimes a little bit dazed,
                and didn’t make anything of it.</p>
            <p>So she can do whatever she likes and doesn’t have to feel awkward about travelling or
                moving house.</p>
            <p>
                <unstress reason="family">So much the better, then. In any event it’s reassuring.
                    Because for my part I believe what he says, and with the good care that Ma gets
                    thanks to Wil there’s little chance of ‘contracting some disease or
                    other’.</unstress>
            </p>
            <p>Wanted to let you know straightaway. It’s reassuring for me, too.I’m really looking
                forward to Antwerp now. The first thing I’ll do there will probably be to go and see
                Leys’s paintings in his dining room, if one can see them. You know, that Walk on the
                ramparts and the one that Bracquemond etched, The table, The servant.</p>
            <p>I imagine that it’ll be beautiful there in the winter, too, with snow on the docks.
                Obviously I’ll take a few paintings with me, and they’ll be the ones that I would
                otherwise have sent to you in the next few days.</p>
            <p>A large mill on the heath in the evening, and a view of the village behind a row of
                poplars with yellow leaves, a still life and a number of drawings of figures.</p>
            <p>I’m at something of a stand with the work here at present. It’s freezing hard, so
                it’s no longer possible to work outdoors. It’s better if I just don’t use any more
                models as long as I’m living in this house; at any rate not until I come back.
                Besides, I’m saving my paint and canvas so as to have ammunition there.<stress
                    reason="environment">SO THE SOONER I CAN GET AWAY, THE BETTER.</stress></p>
            <p>
                <stress reason="career">I recently received a letter from Leurs about my paintings.
                    He wrote that Tersteeg and Wisselingh had seen them and thought them ‘not
                    suitable for them’.</stress>
            </p>
            <p>All the same, I maintain that I’ll make people change their minds — even if Tersteeg
                and Wisselingh don’t want to.</p>
            <p>I’ve just read a few books in the style of Gigoux’s Souvenirs, which my friend in
                Eindhoven had sent for, in which I found some very interesting things about the
                fellows of those days, starting with Paul Huet. <unstress reason="career">And which
                    give me confidence that I haven’t tackled nature the wrong way, nor the
                    technique of painting, although I freely admit that I will and must still
                    change.</unstress></p>
            <p>There you have those heads that are with you, there must be good ones among them, I’m
                as good as certain of it. So — let’s go.</p>
            <p>I don’t think this winter will be dull. It’s obvious that it’ll mainly be a question
                of working hard. But there’s something singular in the very idea that one has to
                take the plunge.</p>
            <p>I’m taking a stock of the paint that I can easily get ground here myself — but it’ll
                help me if I can find a few more colours in a better quality there. I’m also taking
                at least 40 stretching frames the same size as those studies of heads that are with
                you. And drawing materials and paper so that, however I get on, I’ll always be able
                to do something. Because I’ve worked entirely alone for years, I imagine that
                although I will and although I can learn from others and even adopt technical things
                — all the same I’ll always see through my own eyes and tackle things originally.</p>
            <p>However, nothing could be surer than that I’ll try to learn more things. And if I can
                — particularly the nude figure. <stress reason="money">I imagine, though, that in
                    order to get models, as many as I want and good, I won’t be done all at once,
                    but will have to find the money for it by making other things.</stress> Be it
                landscapes, be it townscapes, be it portraits, as I said — or — even if it were
                signboards and decoration. Or — something I didn’t mention in my last letter among
                the things that I could do ‘on the side’ — give lessons in painting, letting them
                begin by painting still lifes — which I believe is a different method from that of
                the drawing masters. I’ve tried it out on those friends of mine in Eindhoven, and
                I’d dare repeat it.</p>
            <p>I’ll certainly leave immediately, as soon as I get the monthly allowance from you.
                And as to that, should you by chance be in a position to send it a week earlier, I’d
                leave a week earlier. It goes without saying, though, that I’m not counting on it.
                I’m glad that I went to see the museum in Amsterdam once more before this, because
                I’ve seen from the work since that what I saw there has been useful to me. Write
                soon if you have time. I wanted to tell you Van de Loo’s opinion of Ma
                straightaway.Since I’m already busy packing up my things, it goes without saying
                that my thoughts are more there than here.</p>
            <p><stress reason="career">Here I’ve just kept on ceaselessly painting in order to learn
                    painting, to get firm ideas about colour, without leaving much room in my head
                    for other things.</stress>
                <unstress reason="environment">But when I escaped to Amsterdam for a few days, I was
                    really delighted to see paintings once again.</unstress> For it’s sometimes
                damned hard to be entirely away from paintings and the world of painters and not to
                see anything by other people. Since then I’ve had quite a yearning to get back into
                it, at least for a while.</p>
            <p>If one’s entirely out of it for a couple of years and wrestles with nature, that can
                sometimes help, and at the same time one perhaps gets a new stock of confidence and
                health out of it, which one can under no circumstances have too much of, though,
                because the painter’s life is often harsh enough.As regards my work, I’ll have to
                act according to circumstances, I mean, if I could perhaps make the acquaintance of
                an art buyer and persuade him to show some of my things. But tomorrow doesn’t mean
                never, and you’ll soon see something of it, particularly if I succeed in making new
                studies of heads or figures. <work origin="existing" stage="finished">The one
                    landscape I’m taking with me — and possibly both — but the one with the yellow
                    leaves:</work> I think you’d like it too. I enclose a quick croquis of it.</p>
            <p>The horizon is a dark line against a light line of sky in white and blue. In this
                dark line little flecks of red, bluish and green or brown, forming the silhouette of
                the roofs and orchards, the field greenish. The sky higher up, grey, against it the
                black trunks and yellow leaves. Foreground completely covered with fallen yellow
                leaves, in which 2 little black figures and one blue. On the right a birch trunk,
                white and black, and a green trunk with redbrown leaves.</p>

        <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
        <body>
            <p> It’s already rather late, i.e. nearly 12 o’clock, but I still want to write a few
                words to you today. First of all, because it was such a long time ago that I wrote
                to you — but old chap, what should I write to you? — <stress reason="career">am
                    swamped with all kinds of work here, so that the days pass by, but often one
                    doesn’t even have time to think or do things that would otherwise appeal to
                    one.</stress> But what particularly compels me to write is what I heard from
                home, namely that they’ve offered to send you to Paris for 6 weeks. If you go there,
                you’ll pass by the Borinage. Wouldn’t you consider spending a day here, or longer if
                possible? I’d so much like you to know this country, because there’s so very much
                that’s unique to be noticed by those who look at things closely. Wouldn’t it be
                remarkable for someone who had never seen a seaside village to see Scheveningen or
                Katwijk or some other village? Well then — there’s no sea here, but the character of
                all things is interesting and worth getting to know. So should you feel the desire
                and are so inclined, and can find the time and opportunity, please stop over here,
                but write ahead of time when you’re coming and whereabouts I can find you, at which
                station and on which train. </p>
            <p> I’ll give this letter to Ma when she comes, because in all likelihood I’ll be
                meeting her when she returns from Paris. Am eagerly longing to see her. </p>
            <p> Fortunately for Uncle, the danger seems to have been averted for the time being. </p>
            <p> What affected me deeply was hearing that Frans Soek died, I’d like to hear some
                particulars in the matter from you, if you happen to know anything, poor chap, life
                wasn’t easy for him, but rather quite a struggle. </p>
            <p> We had a terrible storm here a couple of days ago, around 11 o’clock in the evening.
                There’s a place nearby where one can see in the distance, below, a large part of the
                Borinage, with the chimneys, mountains of coal, small workers’ houses, small black
                figures moving about during the day as though in an ants’ nest, in the far distance
                dark fir woods with small white workers’ houses in front of them, a couple of little
                towers in the distance, an old mill. Usually a sort of fog hangs over it, or else
                there’s the fanciful effect of light and shade owing to the shadows of clouds that
                remind one of paintings by Rembrandt or Michel or Ruisdael. But on the occasion of
                that storm in the pitchblack night, it was a special effect caused by the flashes of
                lightning that made everything visible just for a moment now and then. Nearby, the
                large, sombre buildings of the Marcasse mine, standing alone and set apart on the
                flat field, which that night, during the violent rains, truly reminded one of the
                hulk of Noah’s ark, as it would have appeared in the darkness of the Flood by the
                light of a lightning flash. Inspired by the impression made by that storm, I
                included a description of a shipwreck in the Bible reading this evening. </p>
            <p> Am currently reading Uncle Tom’s cabin a lot — there’s still so much slavery in the
                world — and in that astonishingly beautiful book this extremely momentous matter is
                treated with such wisdom, with a love and a zeal and interest in the genuine welfare
                of the poor and oppressed, that one can’t help coming back to it again and again and
                finding more in it each time. </p>
            <p> I know no better definition of the word Art than this, ‘Art is man added to nature’,
                nature, reality, truth, but with a meaning, with an interpretation, with a character
                that the artist brings out and to which he gives expression, which he sets free,
                which he unravels, releases, elucidates. </p>
            <p> A painting by Mauve or Maris or Israëls speaks more and more clearly than nature
                itself. So it is with books as well, and in Uncle Tom’s cabin in particular, things
                have been put in a new light by the artist, and thus in that book, even though it’s
                already beginning to be an old book, i.e. one written years ago, all things are made
                new. It’s so subtly felt, it’s so well worked out, it’s so masterly. It was written
                with so much love, so much seriousness and so faithful to the truth and with
                knowledge of the subject. It’s so humble and simple but at the same time so truly
                sublime, so noble and so distinguished. </p>
            <p> Recently read a book about the English coalmining district, but it didn’t give very
                many details. Herewith a woodcut for your scrapbook. </p>
            <p> Lately made the acquaintance of someone who supervised the workers for years. Is of
                humble origins but worked his way up. Now he has a chest complaint, quite serious,
                and can no longer stand the terribly exhausting work down in the mine. It’s very
                important to hear him talk about the subject. He has always remained the workmen’s
                friend (in contrast to many others who worked their way up, not because of true
                distinction but because of money, driven by motives less noble and many times more
                base). He has a labourer’s heart, true and honest and courageous, but is far above
                most of them as regards intellectual development. </p>
            <p> On more than one occasion during a strike, he was the only person who could exert
                any influence on the workers. </p>
            <p> They would hear no one, they would listen to no one but him, and at the critical
                moment no one was obeyed but him alone. When I met him for the first time, I thought
                of the etching after Meissonier, with which you are familiar, The reader. One of
                Denis’s boys is as good as engaged to his daughter, which is why he comes here to
                the house, though but seldom, and I made his acquaintance. Since then I’ve visited
                him a few times. </p>
            <p> Have you ever read Legouvé’s Les pères et les enfants, that’s a remarkable book,
                found it there in the house and read it with interest. </p>
            <p> Received a letter a few days ago from the Rev. Jones of Isleworth in which he writes
                about the building of wooden churches here in the Borinage. Is it feasible? Is it
                desirable? He has a mind to work towards that goal, i.e. erecting the first of such
                buildings. </p>
            <p> Even talks about coming over here sometime in the autumn to discuss the matter. </p>
            <p> I truly wish that such a thing may come to pass. </p>
            <p> Write a few words if you have time, and if you can, stop here on your way to Paris.
                In any event, let me know if possible on which train you’ll be passing through one
                of the railway stations in the vicinity of Wasmes, and which station, because I’ll
                do my best to be there. </p>
            <p>Blessings on your work, and believe me ever</p>

        <salutation>My dear Theo, </salutation>
        <body>
            <p><unstress reason="family">I have to thank you very much for a consignment of colours,
                    which was also accompanied by an excellent woollen waistcoat.</unstress> How
                kind you are to me, and how I’d like to be able to do something good in order to
                prove to you that I’d like to be less ungrateful. Your colours reached me at the
                right moment, for what I brought back from Arles is almost exhausted. The thing is,
                I’ve been working this month in the olive groves, for they’d driven me mad with
                their Christs in the garden, in which nothing is observed. Of course there’s no
                question of me doing anything from the Bible – and I’ve written to Bernard, and also
                to Gauguin, that I believed that thinking and not dreaming was our duty, that I was
                therefore astonished when looking at their work by the fact that they give way to
                that. For Bernard has sent me photos of his canvases. The thing about them is that
                they’re sorts of dreams and nightmares, that there’s some erudition there – one can
                see that it’s someone who’s mad about the primitives – but frankly the English
                PreRaphaelites did this much better, and then Puvis and Delacroix are much healthier
                than those PreRaphaelites. So this doesn’t leave me cold, but it gives me an
                uncomfortable feeling of a tumble rather than progress. Well, to shake this off,
                I’ve been messing about in the groves morning and evening on these bright and cold
                days, but in very beautiful, clear sunshine, and the result is 5 no. 30 canvases
                which, with the 3 studies of olive trees that you have, at least constitute an
                attack on the problem. The olive tree is variable like our willow or pollard in the
                north. <work origin="new" stage="middle">You know that willows are very picturesque,
                    despite the fact that it appears monotonous, it’s the tree typical of the
                    country. Now what the willow is in our native country, the olive tree and the
                    cypress have exactly the same importance here. What I’ve done is a rather harsh
                    and coarse realism beside their abstractions, but it will nevertheless impart
                    the rustic note, and will smell of the soil.</work> How I’d like to see the
                studies from nature by Gauguin and Bernard, the latter tells me of portraits which
                doubtless would please me more. <work stage="planned" origin="new">I hope I’ll get
                    used to working in the cold – in the morning there are very interesting effects
                    of white frost and fog, and I still have the great desire to do for the
                    mountains and for the cypresses what I’ve just done for the olive trees, have a
                    really good go at them.</work></p>
            <p>The thing is, the olive tree and the cypress have rarely been painted, and from the
                point of view of placing the paintings this ought to go to England, I know well
                enough what they’re looking for over there. Whatever the case, I’m almost sure that
                in this way I’ll do something passable from time to time. As I said to Isaäcson,
                it’s really more and more my opinion that by working assiduously from nature,
                without saying to oneself in advance, I want to do this or that, by working as if
                one were making shoes, without artistic preoccupations, one won’t always do well,
                but on the days when one thinks about it the least one finds a subject that holds
                its own with the work of those who came before us. <stress reason="career">One
                    learns to know a country that’s basically quite different from what it appears
                    at first sight. On the contrary, one will say to oneself, I want to finish my
                    paintings better, I want to do them with care; in the face of the difficulties
                    of the weather, of changing effects, a heap of ideas like this finds itself
                    reduced to being impracticable, and I end up resigning myself by saying, it’s
                    experience and each day’s little bit of work alone that in the long run matures
                    and enables one to do things that are more complete or more right. </stress>So
                slow, long work is the only road, and all ambition to be set on doing well, false.
                For one must spoil as many canvases as one succeeds with when one mounts the breach
                each morning. To paint, the tranquil, regulated life would therefore be absolutely
                necessary, and at present what can one do when one sees that Bernard, for example,
                is always put under pressure, pressure, pressure by his parents. He can’t do as he
                wants, and many others with him. One says to oneself, I shan’t paint any more, but
                what will one do then? <stress reason="money">Ah – a more expeditious painting
                    process should be invented, less expensive than oil and yet durable.</stress> A
                painting... it will end up becoming as commonplace as a sermon, a painter like
                someone who’s a century behind the times. It’s a shame, though, that it should be
                so. Now if the painters had better understood Millet as a man – now some like
                Lhermitte and Roll have grasped him – things wouldn’t be so. One must work as hard
                and with as few pretensions as a peasant if one wants to last. And instead of
                putting on grandiose exhibitions, it would have been better to address oneself to
                the common people, and work so that everyone may have paintings or reproductions at
                home, which are lessons like the work of Millet.</p>
            <p><stress reason="money">I’m completely at the end of my canvas, and when you can
                    please send me 10 metres.</stress>
                <work origin="new" stage="planned">Then I’m going to attack the cypresses and the
                    mountains.</work> I think that this must be the centre of the work I’ve done
                here and there in Provence, and then we can conclude the stay here when it’s
                convenient. Which isn’t urgent, for Paris only distracts, after all. I don’t know,
                though, not always being a pessimist – <work stage="planned" origin="new">I keep
                    telling myself that I still have it in my heart to paint a bookshop one day with
                    the shop window yellowpink, in the evening, and the passersby black – it’s such
                    an essentially modern subject</work>. Because it also appears such a figurative
                source of light. I say, that would be a subject that would look good between an
                olive grove and a wheatfield, the sowing of books, of prints. I have that very much
                in my heart to do, like a light in the darkness. Yes, there’s a way of seeing Paris
                as beautiful. But anyway, bookshops aren’t hares, and there’s no hurry, and I have a
                good will to work here for another year, which will probably be wiser.</p>
            <p>Mother must have been in Leiden for a good fortnight by now.</p>
            <p>I’ve delayed sending you the canvases for them because<work origin="new"
                    stage="finished"> I’ll include them with the canvas of the wheatfield for the
                    Vingtistes</work>.</p>
            <p>Warm regards to Jo, she’s very good, continuing to be well. Thank you once again for
                the colours and for the woollen waistcoat, and good handshake in thought.</p>

        <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
        <body>
            <p> On the evening of the day we spent together, which for me passed as if in a
                twinkling, I want to write to you after all. <good_health>It was a great joy for me
                    to see and talk to you again, and it’s fortunate that such a day that passes in
                    a twinkling and a joy of such short duration nevertheless remains in our memory,
                    and that the remembrance of it is of a lasting nature.</good_health> After we’d
                taken leave of each other I walked back, not the shortest way but along Trekweg.
                There are workshops of all kinds there that look pleasant, especially lit up in the
                evening, which also speak in their own way to us who are, after all, labourers and
                workers, each in the sphere and in the work whereunto we have been called, if only
                we care to listen, for they say, work while it is day, before the night cometh, when
                no man can work, and they remind us that the Father worketh hitherto, and that we
                too must work. </p>
            <p> It was the very moment when the streetsweepers were coming home with their carts
                with old white horses, there was a long line of those carts standing by the socalled
                sludge works at the beginning of Trekweg. Some of those old white horses resemble a
                certain old aquatint that you perhaps know, an engraving with no very great artistic
                value but which nevertheless struck me and made an impression on me. I mean the last
                of the series of prints titled ‘The life of a horse’. That print depicts an old
                white horse, emaciated and spent and worn out to death by a long life of heavy
                labour and much and difficult work. The poor animal stands in an indescribably
                lonely and forsaken place, a plain with lank, withered grass and here and there a
                twisted tree, bent and cracked by the storm wind. On the ground lies a skull and in
                the distance, in the background, the bleached skeleton of a horse lying next to a
                hut, where the man who slaughters horses lives. </p>
            <p> A stormy sky hangs over the whole, it’s a foul and bleak day, sombre and dark
                weather. It’s a sorrowful and profoundly melancholy scene that must move everyone
                who knows and feels that we, too, must one day go through that which we call dying,
                and that at the end of human life there are tears or grey hair. What lies beyond is
                a great mystery that God alone comprehends, who has however revealed this
                irrefutably in His word, that there is a resurrection of the dead. </p>
            <p> The poor horse — the old faithful servant, stands patient and submissive, but
                courageous nonetheless and as resolute, as it were, as the old guard who said ‘the
                guard dies but does not surrender’ — waits for its final hour. I couldn’t help
                thinking of that print this evening when I saw those dustcart horses. And now, as
                far as the drivers themselves are concerned, with their dirty, dingy clothes, they
                seemed to be sunk or rooted in poverty almost more deeply than that long row or
                rather group of poor people drawn by master Degroux in his paupers’ pew. Write and
                tell me if you know that print. I’d like to speak to the dustmen, if they would only
                come and sit in the paupers’ pew and consider it worthwhile to come and hear about
                the gospel and the lot of the poor and God, too, their Keeper and their Shade upon
                their right hand. You see, it always strikes me and it is remarkable, when we see
                the image of unutterable and indescribable forsakenness — of loneliness — of poverty
                and misery, the end of things or their extremity — the thought of God comes to mind.
                At least this is the case with me, and doesn’t Pa also say: There is no place I
                would rather speak than a cemetery, for there we are all on equal ground — there we
                not only stand on equal ground but there we also feel that we are standing on equal
                ground, and elsewhere we don’t always feel that. </p>
            <p> I’m glad that we saw the museum together, especially the works by Degroux and Leys
                and so many other remarkable paintings, such as that landscape by Coosemans, among
                others. <good_health>I’m very happy about the two prints you gave me,</good_health>
                but you should have let me give you that small etching, The three mills. Now you’ve
                paid it all yourself, not just half of it as I had so wished — you must keep it in
                your scrapbook, however, because it’s remarkable, even though it isn’t very well
                executed. In my ignorance I’d think it attributable to Peasant Bruegel rather than
                to Velvet Brueghel. I hereby enclose that scratch, ‘The Au charbonnage café’. I
                should really rather like to start making rough sketches of some of the many things
                one meets along the way, but considering I wouldn’t actually do it very well and it
                would most likely keep me from my real work, it’s better I don’t begin. <work
                    origin="new" stage="middle">As soon as I got home I began working on a sermon on
                    ‘the barren fig tree’, Luke XIII:69.</work>I sincerely hope that you’ll have had
                good days at home, that you also will have stayed over Sunday and found things well
                at Princenhage. </p>
            <p> When you arrive home in The Hague write a quick note if you can find the time, and
                be sure to give my warm regards to the Rooses. That little drawing, ‘The Au
                charbonnage café’ is really nothing special, but the reason I couldn’t help making
                it is because one sees so many coalmen, and they really are a remarkable people.
                This little house is not far from Trekweg, it’s actually a simple inn right next to
                the big workplace where the workers come in their free time to eat their bread and
                drink a glass of beer. Back during my time in England I applied for a position as an
                evangelist among the coalminers, but they brushed my request aside and said I had to
                be at least 25 years old. You surely know that one of the root or fundamental
                truths, not only of the gospel but of the entire Bible, is ‘the light that dawns in
                the darkness’. From darkness to Light. Well then, who will most certainly need it,
                who will have an ear to hear it? Experience has taught us that those who work in
                darkness, in the heart of the earth like the mineworkers in the black coalmines,
                among others, are very moved by the message of the gospel and also believe it. In
                the south of Belgium, in Hainaut, from around the area of Mons to the French borders
                and even extending far beyond them, there is a region called the Borinage, where
                there is one of those populations of labourers who work in the many coalmines. I
                found this and other things about them in a geography book: The Borins (people who
                live in the Borinage, an area west of Mons) do nothing but mine coal. They’re an
                impressive sight, these coalmines, opened up 300 metres underground, down which a
                working population worthy of our respect and sympathy descends every day. The
                coalminer is a type peculiar to the Borinage; daylight hardly exists for him, and he
                scarcely enjoys the sun’s rays except on Sunday. He works with great difficulty by
                the light of a lamp whose illumination is pale and feeble, in a narrow gallery, his
                body bent double, and sometimes forced to crawl; his work is to pull from the
                earth’s entrails this mineral substance whose great usefulness we know, he thus
                works in the midst of a thousand constantly recurring dangers, but the Belgian
                foreman has a cheerful character, he’s used to this way of life, and when he goes
                down the pit, his hat topped with a little lamp whose job is to guide him in the
                darkness, he entrusts himself to his God Who sees his labours and Who protects him,
                his wife and his children. His clothing consists of a hat of boiled leather, a
                jacket and a pair of canvas trousers. So the Borinage lies to the south of Lessines,
                where one finds the stonequarries. </p>
            <p> I should like to go there as an evangelist. The threemonth trial period set by
                Messrs De Jonge and the Rev. Pieterszen is nearly over. Paul spent three years in
                Arabia before he became active as a preacher and began his great missionary journeys
                and his actual work among the heathens. If I could spend three years or so in a
                similar region, working in peace and always learning and observing, then I wouldn’t
                return from there without having something to say that is indeed worth hearing; I
                say this in all humility yet with frankness. If God wills it and spares my life, I’d
                be ready by about the age of 30 and could begin, with my special training and
                experience, having more mastery of my affairs and more maturity for the work than I
                do now. I’m writing this to you again, even though we’ve already talked about it.
                There are already a number of small Protestant congregations in the Borinage, and
                certainly schools as well, may God point me to a place where I can be active as an
                evangelist in the way we spoke about, by preaching the gospel to the poor, thus to
                those who have need of it and for whom it is suited to perfection, and devoting my
                time during the week to teaching.You’ve no doubt been to SaintGilles. I once took a
                walk from there to the ‘old boundary mark’. Where the road to Mont Saint Jean begins
                there’s another hill, the Alsemberg. Here, on the right, is the cemetery of
                SaintGilles, full of cedars and ivy, from which one can look out over the city.
                Further on one comes to Forest. The region is very picturesque there, standing on
                the high slopes are old houses like the huts in the dunes that Bosboom painted. One
                sees people doing all kinds of farm work, sowing wheat, lifting potatoes, washing
                turnips, and everything, right down to woodgathering, is picturesque and looks very
                much like Montmartre. </p>
            <p> There are old houses with ivy or Virginia creeper and charming inns, among the
                houses I noticed was that of a mustardmaker, one Verkissen. His place would be
                perfect for a painting by Thijs Maris, for example. There are places here and there
                where stones are found and therefore small quarries to which sunken roads with the
                deep ruts of cart tracks lead, where one sees small white horses with red tassels
                and drivers with blue smocks, and the shepherd is not lacking, nor old women in
                black with white caps reminiscent of those by Degroux. There are also places here —
                as there are everywhere, for that matter, thank God — where one feels at home more
                than elsewhere, where one gets a remarkable, familiar feeling like homesickness,
                which has something bitterly melancholy about it but which nevertheless strengthens
                and awakens the spirit in us and gives us new strength and appetite for work and
                stimulates us, we know not how or why. That day I walked on, past Forest, and took a
                side road to an old church overgrown with ivy. I saw many lime trees, even more
                entwined with one another and even more Gothic, so to speak, than those we saw in
                the park, and at the side of the sunken road leading to the cemetery twisted bushes
                and the roots of trees, as gnarled as those Dürer etched in ‘Knight, Death and the
                Devil’. Have you ever seen a painting, or rather a photo of it, by Carlo Dolci, The
                Garden of Olives? There’s something Rembrandtesque about it, saw it recently. You no
                doubt know the large, rough etching of the same subject after Rembrandt, being the
                pendant of the other, Reading the Bible, with those two women and the cradle. It
                came to mind after you told me that you had seen the painting by père Corot of the
                same subject; I saw it at the exhibition of his work shortly after he died, and it
                moved me deeply. </p>

            <p> Adieu Theo, I shake your hand right heartily in thought, I wish you well, may you

                Borchers sometime, be so good as to tell him that I thank him very much for his
                letter of some time ago. If you go to Mauve’s, give him my regards, and believe me

        <ps>
            <p> I kept this letter for a couple of days. 15 Nov. has passed, so the three months are
                up. Spoke with the Rev. De Jonge and with Master Bokma, they say there is no
                opportunity to be at the school under the same conditions they offer to native
                Flemings — I can attend the lessons, for free if necessary — but this is the only
                privilege — in order to stay, therefore, I would need to have more financial means
                at my disposal than I do now, which is none. So I’ll probably soon try the Borinage
                plan. Once out of the city I shan’t easily return to a big city. It wouldn’t be easy
                to live without believing in Him and without having the faith of old in Him, and
                without that one would lose heart.</p>

        <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
        <body>
            <p>
                <bad_health>I already wrote to you the day before yesterday that on the one hand I
                    was far from well,</bad_health>
                <unstress reason="environment">but that on the other hand I nevertheless thought I
                    could see some light.</unstress>
            </p>
            <p><stress reason="career">However, I regret that I have to tell you even more
                    categorically that I’m most definitely literally exhausted and
                    overworked.</stress> When you think that I went to live in my own studio on 1
                May — since then it’s perhaps been a matter of 6 or 7 times, so far, that I’ve had
                my midday meal. For good reasons, <stress reason="family">I don’t want you to tell
                    Ma that I’m not well</stress> — because she might possibly consider that it
                wasn’t nice that what happened, happened, that’s to say that I didn’t stay there —
                precisely because of these consequences. I shan’t say anything about it; don’t you
                say anything either. But I lived then, and since then, here, <stress reason="money"
                    >having nothing for my food because the work cost me too much and I relied too
                    much on the idea that I could stick it out like this.</stress></p>
            <p>What the doctor tells me is that I absolutely must live better, and that I have to
                take more care of myself with my work until I’m stronger. It’s total
                debilitation.</p>
            <p><bad_health>Well I’ve made it worse by smoking a lot,</bad_health> which I did all
                the more because then one isn’t troubled by one’s empty stomach.</p>
            <p>Anyway, they say — one has to experience lean times, and I’ve had my share of
                them.</p>
            <p>
                <bad_health>Because it’s not just the food, it’s also all the worry and sorrow that
                    one has.</bad_health>
            </p>
            <p>You know that for one reason or another the time in Nuenen was far from carefree for
                me. What’s more — here — <unstress reason="environment">I’m very pleased to have
                    come here </unstress>— <stress reason="environment">but it’s been a difficult
                    time all the same.</stress></p>
            <p><stress reason="money">What we have to do and what is largely lacking — is this.
                    Paying the models ourselves is too much; as long as one doesn’t have enough
                    money,</stress> one must take advantage of the opportunities at the studios,
                like Verlat, like Cormon. And one must be in the artists’ world and work at clubs
                where one shares the cost of the models.</p>
            <p>Now it’s true that I didn’t think of this before, or at least didn’t do it — but I
                wish now that I’d started on it a year earlier. If we could now find some way of
                living in the same city it would be far and away the best thing, at least for the
                time being.</p>
            <p>Only, the more I think about it, the more and more I fancy that it might be better
                not to spend much on a studio in the first year, because I’ll mostly have to draw in
                that first year.</p>
            <p>Because speaking of Cormon — I imagine he would tell me much the same as Verlat says
                — that I have to draw nudes or plaster casts for up to a year, precisely because
                I’ve always drawn from life.</p>
            <p>This isn’t really a harsh requirement, because I tell you that there are people here
                who’ve been in the class for 3 years and are still not allowed to stop, who also
                paint. In that year I have to practise the male and the female figure, both in
                detail and as a whole, and — then I’ll know it by heart, as it were. Drawing in
                itself, technically, is easy enough for me — I’m beginning to do it the way one
                writes, with the same ease. But precisely at this level it becomes more interesting,
                as one is not satisfied with the facility that one gradually acquires but really
                looks for originality and breadth of conception. Drawing the masses rather than the
                outlines. Solid modelling. And I can assure you it’s not a bad sign if people like
                Verlat or Cormon, let’s say, demand that of someone. For there are enough of them
                that Verlat simply leaves to get on with it because — they just aren’t the fellows
                for the loftier figure. You talk about the clever fellows at Cormon’s studio.
                Precisely because I damned well want to be one of them, I’m setting myself in
                advance, out of my own conviction, the requirement of spending at least a year in
                Paris mainly drawing from the nude and plaster casts. For the rest, let’s do
                whatsoever our hand finds to do in the way of painting, if an effect out of doors
                strikes us or we happen to have a good model (and);c.</p>
            <p>And don’t think that this is the long way, because it’s the short one. Someone who
                can draw his figures from memory is much more productive than someone who can’t. And
                by my taking the trouble to spend that year drawing — you’ll just see how productive
                we become. And don’t think either that the years I worked out of doors were wasted.
                For it’s the very thing that people who’ve never been anywhere else but at academies
                and studios lack, that view of reality in which they live, and finding subjects.
                Anyway.</p>
            <p><stress reason="money">Might it not be wise if we put off renting a studio at least
                    for the first six months, precisely because it all comes down to the money?
                </stress>But otherwise I like the idea of setting up a studio a great deal, a very
                great deal. Even, if need be, such that one could combine with other painters to
                take models together. The more energy the better. And in hard times — one must
                especially seek a way out in friendship and collaboration.</p>
            <p>But Theo, it’s so rotten about this indisposition — I’m dreadfully sorry — but I’m
                still in good spirits. It will get better. You understand that it would have got
                worse and worse if I’d delayed doing something about it.</p>
            <p>What I think, though, is this — one mustn’t think that people whose constitution is
                damaged, wholly or half, aren’t fit for painting. It’s desirable for one to make it
                to 60 at least, and necessary for one to make it to 50, if one begins when one is
                around 30.</p>
            <p>But one absolutely doesn’t have to be perfectly healthy; one may have all sorts of
                things wrong. The work doesn’t always suffer as a result — on the contrary, nervous
                fellows are more sensitive and more refined. But Theo, precisely because it has
                proved in my case that my health leaves something to be desired — I’ve decided to
                concentrate specifically on the loftier figure and to try to refine myself.
                    I<bad_health>t really struck me so unexpectedly — I did feel weak and feverish,
                    but I still kept going. Only it began to worry me that teeth were breaking off
                    one after another. And that I was starting to look worse and worse. Anyway,
                    we’ll see about putting it right.</bad_health></p>
            <p><bad_health>I think that getting the teeth attended to will help in itself because,
                    as my mouth was usually painful, I just swallowed my food as quickly as
                    possible</bad_health>.</p>
            <p>And perhaps it will also help my appearance, at least a little.</p>
            <p>As regards this month, I’ve paid 25 francs in advance for my room, 30 francs in
                advance for my food, and 50 francs to the dentist; also a visit to the doctor and
                some drawing materials — which leaves 6 francs.</p>
            <p><bad_health>Now the important issue this month is not to be ill, which isn’t easy to
                    resolve — and which could very well happen.</bad_health> But we’ll see — I still
                think I’ve got a certain toughness in common with the peasants, who also don’t eat
                anything very special and still go on living and working. So don’t worry too much
                about it. If you could send a little bit extra, very well — but if you can’t, I’ll
                wait calmly to see how it goes. <bad_health>What I don’t like is that I’m feverish,
                </bad_health>and I reason about it thus: although I may be weakened, I’ve still
                taken some care not to eat any unwholesome food. Overexertion isn’t excessive either
                — because, despite everything, I keep my spirits up all the time — so that it’s
                because I’m weak that I overexert myself. It seems to me that it must sort itself
                out. You understand, though, that if it were to get worse — and took a virulent turn
                — one might have to contend with typhus or at least typhoid fever.</p>
            <p>And actually the only reasons why I certainly don’t expect that are these — 1 that
                I’ve had a great deal of fresh air, and 2 that, as I said, even though I’ve
                evidently not fed myself well enough, as a precaution I’ve nonetheless made do with
                very simple food rather than the muck in the cheap restaurants — and 3 — that I have
                a degree of calm and serenity in the face of things.</p>
            <p>So we must wait and see. Don’t you worry about it, because not even I do — I maintain
                that, supposing I do get a fever, I’ve lived and eaten too simply for it to become
                very virulent all that easily. After all, things don’t happen of their own accord,
                and there’s a reason for everything. Write to me soon, though, because I really do
                need it.</p>
            <p>As regards going to Nuenen too — I want to know what you’d think best.</p>
            <p>But I’m not needed there — because someone like Rijken, the gardener, for instance,
                can see to what needs to be packed or sent at least as well as I can.</p>
            <p>If there’s any point in it, though, I can be ready by March if need be.</p>

        <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
        <body>
            <p>I’ve received your letter and 25 francs enclosed and I thank you very much for both.
                I’m really glad that you like my plan to come to Paris. I believe it will help me
                make progress and at the same time that, if I didn’t go, I might easily get into a
                mess, keep moving around in the same circle too much, persist in the same mistakes.
                Furthermore, as for you, I don’t think that coming home to a studio would do you any
                harm. For the rest, I have to tell you the same about me as you write about yourself
                — I’ll disappoint you.</p>
            <p>And even so, this is the way to combine forces. And even so, much greater
                understanding of each other can follow from it.</p>
            <p>Now what shall I tell you about my health? <bad_health>I still believe that I have a
                    chance of avoiding being really ill; all the same, I’ll need time to get better.
                    I also still have two more teeth to be filled, then my upper jaw, which was most
                    affected, will be all right again.</bad_health>
                <stress reason="money">I still have to pay 10 francs for that, and then another 40
                    francs to get the bottom half right too.</stress></p>
            <p>Some years of those 10 years that I appear to have spent in prison will disappear as
                a result. Because bad teeth, which one so seldom sees any more as it’s so easy to
                get them put right, since bad teeth give a physiognomy a sort of sunken look.</p>
            <p>And then — even eating the same things, one can naturally digest better when one can
                chew properly, and so my stomach will have a chance to recover.</p>
            <p>I really do notice that I’ve been at a very low ebb, though — and as you wrote
                yourself, all sorts of things that are even worse could arise out of neglecting it.
                However, we’ll see that we get it put right.</p>
            <p>
                <unstress reason="career">I haven’t worked for a few days, gone to bed early a
                    couple of nights (otherwise it was usually 1 or 2 o’clock because of drawing at
                    the club). And I feel that it’s calming me.</unstress>
            </p>
            <p>I’ve had a note from Ma, who writes that they’re going to start packing in March.</p>
            <p>Further, since you say you’ll have to pay rent until the end of June — well then,
                perhaps it would be best after all if I were to return to Nuenen, starting in March,
                only — if I encountered opposition and scenes like I got before I left, I would be
                wasting my time there and so, even if it were only just for those few months, I’d
                make a change anyhow, since I want to have some new things from the country ready to
                bring to Paris with me.</p>
            <p><stress reason="environment">That Siberdt, the teacher of the antique, who spoke to
                    me at first as I told you, definitely tried to pick a quarrel with me today,
                    perhaps with a view to getting rid of me.</stress> Which didn’t work inasmuch as
                I said — Why are you trying to pick a quarrel with me? I have no wish to quarrel,
                and in any case I have absolutely no desire to contradict you, but you deliberately
                try to pick a quarrel with me.</p>
            <p>He evidently hadn’t expected that and couldn’t say much to refute it this time, but —
                next time, of course, he’ll be able to start something.</p>
            <p>
                <stress reason="friendship">The issue behind it is that the fellows in the class are
                    talking about things in my work among themselves, and I’ve said, not to Siberdt
                    but outside the class to some of the fellows, that their drawings were
                    completely wrong.</stress>
            </p>
            <p>Bear in mind that if I go to Cormon and run into trouble sooner or later either with
                the master or the pupils, I wouldn’t let it worry me. If need be, even if I didn’t
                have a master, I could also go through the antique course by going to draw in the
                Louvre or somewhere. And so I’d do that if I had to — although I’d far rather have
                correction — as long as it doesn’t become DELIBERATE provocation; that correction
                without one giving any cause other than a certain singularity in one’s manner of
                working which is different from the others. If he starts on me again, I’ll say out
                loud in the class, I’m happy to do mechanically everything that you tell me to do,
                because I’m determined to pay you back what is your due, if need be, if you insist
                on it, but — as far as mechanizing me as you mechanize the others is concerned, that
                has not, I assure you, the slightest hold over me.</p>
            <p>Besides, you started by telling me something quite different, that’s to say, you told
                me: tackle it as you wish.</p>
            <p>The reason why I’m drawing plaster casts — not to start from the outline, but to
                start from the centres— I haven’t got it yet, but I feel it more and more and — I’ll
                certainly carry on with it, it’s too interesting.</p>
            <p>I wish that we could spend a few days together in the Louvre and could just talk
                about it. I believe it would interest you.</p>
            <p>This morning I sent you Chérie, mainly for the preface, which will certainly strike
                you.</p>
            <p>And — I wish that at the end of our lives we could also walk somewhere together and —
                looking back, say — we’ve done this — and that’s one; and that — and that’s two; and
                that — and that’s three. And if we want to and dare to — will there be anything to
                talk about then?</p>
            <p>We can try two things — making something good ourselves — collecting things by other
                people that we think are good, and dealing in them. But we must both live rather
                more robustly, and perhaps combining forces is a step towards becoming more
                robust.</p>
            <p>But now allow me to touch on a delicate matter — if I’ve said unpleasant things to
                you, specifically about our upbringing and our home, this has been because we’re in
                an area where being critical is essential in order for us to get along with and
                understand each other and cooperate in business.</p>
            <p>Now I can well understand that one can passionately love something or someone that
                one can’t do anything about.</p>
            <p>Very well — I won’t go into that except in so far as it might make a fatal separation
                between us where reconciliation is needed.</p>
            <p><stress reason="family">And our upbringing — won’t prove to be so good that we’ll
                    retain many illusions about it — there you are — and we might perhaps have been
                    happier with a different upbringing. But if we stick to the positive idea of
                    wanting to produce and to be something, then we’ll be able, without getting
                    angry, to discuss faits accomplis as such when it’s unavoidable and might
                    perhaps touch on or directly concern the Goupils or the family. And for the
                    rest, these issues between us are for the understanding of the situation and not
                    out of rancour. </stress>But if we undertake something it won’t be a matter of
                indifference to either of us to improve our health, because we need time alive —
                some 25 or 30 years of working constantly. There’s so much of interest in the
                present age when one thinks how very possible it is that we may well yet see the
                beginning of the end of a society. And just as there is infinite poetry in the
                autumn or in a sunset, and then there’s so much soul and mysterious endeavour in
                nature, so it is now. And as for art — decline, if you will, after the Delacroix,
                Corots, Millets, Duprés, Troyons, Bretons, Rousseaux, Daubignys — very well — but a
                decline so full of charm — that there truly is still an immense, immense amount of
                good things to come, and they’re being made every day.</p>
            <p>I’m longing dreadfully for the Louvre, Luxembourg etc., where everything will be so
                new to me.</p>
            <p>For the rest of my life I’ll regret that I didn’t see the Cent chefs d’oeuvre, the
                Delacroix exhibition and the Meissonier exhibition. But there will still be plenty
                of opportunities to catch up. It’s true, for instance, that wanting to progress too
                quickly here, I may actually have progressed less, but what would you? My health is
                also behind it, and if I regain that as I hope to do, then my taking pains will have
                been less in vain. After all, I believe that if one asks permission, one may draw
                plaster casts in the Louvre, even if one isn’t at L’Ecole des BeauxArts.</p>
            <p>It wouldn’t surprise me if, once the idea of living together takes hold, you’ll find
                it odder and odder that we’ve been together so surprisingly little, if you will —
                for fully 10 years.</p>
            <p>Anyway, I most certainly hope that this will be the end of it, and that it won’t
                begin again.</p>
            <p>What you say about the apartment is perhaps really rather expensive. I mean, I’d be
                just as happy if it weren’t quite as good.</p>
            <p>I’m curious as to how those few months in Nuenen will be for me. Since I have some
                furniture there, since it’s beautiful there, too, and I know the district a little,
                it might be a good thing for me to keep a piedàterre there, if need be in an inn
                where I could leave that furniture, since otherwise it will be lost — and it could
                still come in very useful.</p>
            <p>There’s sometimes the most to do by returning to old places. I must finish this now,
                since I’m going to the club.</p>
            <p>Keep thinking about what we can best do. </p>

    <letter>
        <salutation>My dear friend,</salutation>
        <body>
            <p>Enclosed a letter that arrived yesterday but which the concierge didn’t pass on to me
                straightaway.</p>
            <p>I’ve been to the Tambourin, because if I didn’t go there people would have thought I
                didn’t dare.</p>
            <p>So I told Miss Segatori that I wouldn’t pass judgement on her over this affair, but
                that it was up to her to judge herself.</p>
            <p>That I’d torn up the receipt for the paintings — but that she had to give everything
                back. </p>
            <p>That if she hadn’t had something to do with what happened to me she would have come
                to see me the next day.</p>
            <p>That as she didn’t come to see me I would take it that she knew people were trying to
                pick a fight with me, but that she’d tried to warn me by saying — go away — which I
                didn’t understand, and besides would perhaps not have wanted to understand. To which
                she replied that the paintings and all the rest were at my disposal.</p>
            <p>She claimed that I’d tried to pick a fight — which doesn’t surprise me — knowing that
                appalling things would be done to her if she took my side.</p>
            <p>I also saw the waiter on my way in, but he made himself scarce.</p>
            <p>Now I didn’t want to take the paintings straightaway, but I said that when you got
                back we’d have a chat about it, because those paintings belonged to you as much as
                to me, and while waiting I urged her to think again about what had happened.</p>
            <p>She didn’t look well and she was as pale as wax, which isn’t a good sign. She didn’t
                know that the waiter had gone up to your place. If that’s true — I would be even
                more inclined to believe it was more the case that she’d tried to warn me people
                were trying to pick a fight with me, than that she’d been up to something herself.
                She can’t do as she’d like. Now I’ll wait till you get back before doing
                anything.</p>
            <p>
                <work origin="new" stage="finished">I’ve done two paintings since you left.</work>
            </p>
            <p>
                <work origin="new" stage="planned">Now I have two louis left, and I fear I won’t
                    know how to get through the days from now till you get back.</work>
            </p>
            <p><stress reason="friendship">Because remember when I started working at Asnières I had
                    lots of canvases and Tanguy was very good to me. He still is, when it comes down
                    to it, but his old witch of a wife noticed what was going on and objected to it.
                    Now I gave Tanguy’s wife a piece of my mind and said it was her fault if I
                    wouldn’t buy anything else from them. Père Tanguy’s wise enough to keep quiet,
                    and he’ll do what I ask of him all the same</stress>.</p>
            <p>But with all that it isn’t easy to work.</p>
            <p>I saw Lautrec today, he’s sold a painting, through Portier, I think. </p>
            <p>Someone brought in a watercolour by Mrs Mesdag, which I find very beautiful.</p>
            <p>Now I hope you’ll enjoy your visit over there, give my mother, Cor and Wil my warm
                regards. And if you can see that I’m not in too much trouble from now till you get
                back by sending me something more, I’ll try to make some more paintings for you —
                because I’m perfectly calm as far as my work goes.</p>
            <p>What bothered me a bit in this business was that by not going (to the Tambourin) it
                looked cowardly. And having gone there restored my peace of mind. </p>
        </body>
        <close>I shake your hand.</close>

    <letter>
        <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
        <body>
            <p> It’s time I write to you again, first of all to wish you happiness at the beginning
                of a new year. May much good be your share, and God’s blessing be on your work in
                this year that we’re beginning. </p>
            <p> I’m eagerly longing for a letter from you, to hear again how things are going and
                how you are, also perhaps to hear if you have recently seen anything beautiful or
                remarkable. </p>
            <p> As far as I’m concerned, you surely understand that there are no paintings here in
                the Borinage, that in general they haven’t the slightest idea of what a painting is,
                so it goes without saying that I’ve seen absolutely nothing in the way of art since
                my departure from Brussels. But this doesn’t mean that this isn’t a very special and
                very picturesque country, everything speaks, as it were, and is full of character.
                There was snow these last few days, the dark days before Christmas. Then everything
                was reminiscent of the medieval paintings by Peasant Bruegel, among others, and by
                so many others who were so good at expressing the singular effect of red and green,
                black and white. Time and again, what one sees here reminds one of the work of Thijs
                Maris or Albrecht Dürer, for example. </p>
            <p> There are sunken roads here, overgrown with thornbushes and with old, twisted trees
                with their gnarled roots, which look exactly like that road in the etching by Dürer,
                The knight and Death. </p>
            <p>
                <unstress reason="environment">These last few days, for instance, it was an
                    extraordinary sight, with the white snow in the evening around the twilight
                    hour, seeing the workers returning home from the mines. </unstress>These people
                are completely black when they come out of the dark mines into the daylight again,
                they look just like chimneysweeps. Their houses are usually small and could better
                be called huts, scattered along the sunken roads and in the wood and against the
                slopes of the hills. One sees mosscovered roofs here and there, and the light shines
                kindly in the evening through the smallpaned windows.Just as in Brabant we have the
                copse and the oak wood, and in Holland the pollard willows, so here one sees those
                black thornbushes around the gardens, fields and land. The recent snow gave it the
                effect of letters written on white paper, like the pages of the gospel. </p>
            <p> I’ve already spoken here at various times, both in a fairly large room, specially
                furnished for religious meetings, and in the gatherings that are customarily held in
                the workers’ houses in the evenings, which one can best call Biblereading. Spoke,
                among other things, on: the parable of the mustard seed, the barren fig tree, the
                man who was blind from his birth. On Christmas, of course, on the stable of
                Bethlehem, and Peace on earth. </p>
            <p> May it come to pass with God’s blessing that I be placed here permanently somewhere;
                I should sincerely wish it. </p>
            <p> Everywhere around here one sees the big chimneys and the huge mountains of coal at
                the entrance to the mines, the socalled coalpits. You know that large drawing by
                Bosboom, Chaudfontaine, it conveys the character of the land here well, only here
                everything is coal, in the north of Hainaut stonequarries, and Chaudfontaine more
                iron ore. </p>
            <p> I still think so often of that day when you were in Brussels and of our visit to the
                Museum. And I often wish that you were a bit closer and we could be together more
                often. Do write again soon. Again and again I look at that etching of A young
                citizen. The mineworkers’ language is not all that easy to understand, but they
                understand normal French well if one can speak it rapidly and fluently, then it
                naturally resembles their dialect, which is spoken amazingly fast. At a gathering
                this week I spoke on the text Acts XVI:9 ‘And a vision appeared to Paul in the
                night; There stood a man of Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come over into
                Macedonia, and help us.’ And they listened attentively when I tried to describe what
                that Macedonian was like who needed and longed for the comfort of the gospel and the
                knowledge of the Only True God. How we should imagine him as a worker with signs of
                sorrow and suffering and fatigue on his face, without form or glory but with an
                immortal soul that has need of the meat which endureth unto everlasting life, namely
                the Word of God, for man cannot live by bread alone, but by every word that
                proceedeth out of the mouth of God. </p>
            <p> How Jesus Christ is the Master who can strengthen, comfort and enlighten a man like
                the Macedonian, a workman and labourer who has a hard life. Because He himself is
                the great Man of Sorrows, who knows our diseases, who himself is called the
                carpenter’s son, even though He was the Son of God and the great physician of sick
                souls. Who worked for 30 years in a humble carpenter’s workshop to carry out God’s
                will; and God wants man to live and walk humbly upon the earth, in imitation of
                Christ, minding not high things, but condescending to men of low estate, learning
                from the gospel to be meek and lowly in heart. </p>
            <p> I’ve already had the opportunity to visit a few sick people, for many people here
                are ill. Wrote today to the president of the Comité d’Evangelisation to request that
                my case be brought before the next meeting of the committee. </p>
            <p>
                <unstress reason="environment">It thawed last night, I cannot tell you how
                    picturesque the hilly countryside looks in the thaw, now that the snow is
                    melting and the black fields with the green of the winter wheat are again
                    becoming visible.</unstress> For foreigners the villages here are truly a maze,
                with countless narrow streets and alleyways with the small houses of the workers, at
                the foot of the hills as well as on their slopes and at the top. It can best be
                compared to a village like Scheveningen, especially the poor quarters, or to those
                villages in Brittany that we know from paintings. For that matter, you rode through
                this region yourself on the railway journey to and from Paris, and maybe remember it
                a little. The Protestant churches are small, similar to the one in Hoeven, but
                slightly larger, but where I spoke was only a simple, large room that can hold a
                hundred people if necessary. I also attended a service in a stable or barn, so it’s
                quite simple and novel. </p>
            <p> Write soon when you have the time, and remember that you are repeatedly, even
                constantly, in my thoughts. Wishing again that God’s best blessings may be your
                share in the new year, and shaking your hand in thought, believe me ever </p>

            <p> Give my regards to everyone at the Rooses’ and wish them all, and anyone who should
                happen to ask after me, a happy New Year. If you write, please address your letter

        <salutation>My dear Theo, </salutation>
        <body>
            <p><unstress reason="friendship">Yesterday I was pleasantly surprised by a visit from Mr
                    Salles who, I believe, had had a letter from you. I was completely well when he
                    came so we were able to talk calmly.</unstress> But I’m most confused that he
                should have put himself out for me, the more so because I hope that I’ve regained my
                presence of mind for a while. For the moment it seems to me that the best thing will
                be to carry on here. I’ll see what Mr Peyron says when I have a chance to speak to
                him; he’ll probably say that he absolutely cannot guarantee anything in advance,
                which seems quite right to me.</p>
            <p>Today I’m dispatching a few canvases, the following:<work origin="new"
                    stage="finished">Ploughed field with background of mountains – it’s the same
                    field of the reaper from this summer and can be a pendant to it; I think that
                    one will set off the other.</work></p>
            <p>
                <work stage="finished" origin="new">The ravine. This is the study done on a day when
                    the mistral was blowing – I had wedged my easel in place with large stones – the
                    painting of this isn’t dry, it’s in a tauter drawing style, and there’s more
                    suppressed passion and it has more colour.</work>
            </p>
            <p>
                <work origin="new" stage="finished">This can go with another study of mountains,
                    summer effect, with a road in the foreground and a black hovel.</work>
            </p>
            <p>
                <work stage="finished" origin="new">Women picking olives – I’d intended this
                    painting for our mother and sister so that they might have something a little
                    studied.</work>
            </p>
            <p>I also have a repetition of it for you, and the study (more coloured with more solemn
                tones) from nature.</p>

                    boulevard of StRémy, study from nature – I have a repetition of it here which is

            <p>That’s to say, you’ll remove the nails from other canvases and mount these on the
                stretching frames, one by one if you like, to appreciate the effect. For the
                colourings absolutely need to be set off by the white frame to judge the ensemble.
                Thus the rain, the grey olive trees, one can scarcely see them without the
                frame.</p>
            <p>This will somewhat fill the hole left by the canvases that have gone off to the
                Vingtistes – you must ask Tanguy to remove the nails from other canvases and to
                mount these on stretching frames so that they dry all the way through.</p>
            <p>In your previous letter you talk of Hugo’s drawings – I’ve just seen a volume of
                Michelet’s (illustrated) Histoire de France. I saw admirable drawings in it by
                Vierge which were completely like something by Victor Hugo, astonishing things. Do
                you know that? When you see Mr Lauzet ask him if he knows them, there’s also a
                resemblance with Hervier’s talent, but more complete, with more dramatic figures and
                effects – it also resembles the illustrations for The life of Frederick the Great by
                Menzel. Most curious.</p>
            <p>I think that Vierge has also gone to Charenton, but how that fellow has worked. At
                one time Boggs had a magnificent wood engraving of his, probably published by
                L’Illustration, Seabathing – a crowd of men and women – drawing in the manner of
                Doré, who one day did precisely the same subject very well on a page also published
                by L’Illustration – but then with Vierge there’s Daumier’s rich execution in
                full.</p>
            <p>I hope that Jo’s health and yours are good, and that you no longer have any anxiety
                on my account.</p>
            <p>Write to me if you can soon after receiving the canvases. Good handshake in thought
                to you and your wife.</p>

        <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
        <body>
            <p><work origin="new" stage="finished">Yesterday I sent three packets by parcel post
                    containing studies which I hope you’ll receive in good order.</work> I really
                must thank you for the 10 metres of canvas, which have just arrived.</p>
            <p>
                <work stage="finished" origin="new">Among the studies you’ll find the following,
                    which are for our mother and sister. Olive trees – Bedroom – Reaper – Working
                    with plough – Wheatfield with cypresses – Orchard in blossom – Portrait.</work>
            </p>
            <p>The remainder is above all autumn studies and I think the best one is the yellow
                mulberry tree against a very blue sky. Then the study of the house and of the park,
                of which there are two variants. <work origin="new" stage="middle">The studies on
                    no. 30 canvases weren’t yet dry and will follow later. They’re giving me a lot
                    of trouble, and sometimes I find them very ugly, sometimes they look good to me
                    – perhaps you’ll have the same impression when you see them. There are a dozen
                    of them, so it’s more substantial than what I’ve just sent.</work></p>
            <p>In spite of the cold I’m continuing to work outside up to now, and I think that it’s
                good for me and for the work.</p>
            <p><work stage="finished" origin="new">The last study I did is a view of the village –
                    where people were at work – under enormous plane trees – repairing the
                    pavements. So there are piles of sand, stones and the gigantic treetrunks – the
                    yellowing foliage, and here and there glimpses of a housefront and little
                    figures.</work><stress reason="family">I often think of you and Jo, but with a
                    feeling as if there was an enormous distance from here to Paris and as if it
                    were years since I saw you.</stress> I hope that your health is good, for myself
                I can’t complain, I feel absolutely normal, so to speak, but without ideas for the
                future, and truly I don’t know what it’s going to be, and perhaps I’m avoiding going
                into this question deeply, sensing that I can do nothing about it.</p>
            <p>
                <work origin="new" stage="middle">I’ve finished, or almost, the copy of The diggers
                    too.</work>
            </p>
            <p>You’ll see that there are no more impastos in the large studies. I prepare the thing
                with sorts of washes with spirits, and then proceed with touches or hatchings of
                colour with spaces between them. This imparts atmosphere and uses less paint.</p>
            <p>If I want to send this letter off today I must hurry, so handshake in thought and
                warm regards to Jo.</p>

    </letter>
    <letter>
        <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
        <body>
            <p>
                <stress reason="family">I definitely need to tell you that it would reassure me
                    greatly if you were to approve my coming to Paris much earlier than June or July
                    if need be. The more I think about it, the more desirable this appears to
                    me.</stress>
            </p>
            <p>Consider that if everything goes well and if I had good food throughout that time,
                which will certainly not be plain sailing, consider that even in that case it will
                take 6 months or so before I’m entirely well.</p>
            <p>But it would certainly take even longer if things were to be the same for me in
                Brabant from March to July as they’ve been for the past few months, and it’s likely
                they’d be no different.</p>
            <p>
                <bad_health>Now at the moment it’s just because of reaction to overexertion that I
                    feel terribly weak, in fact even worse. Still, that’s the natural course of
                    things and nothing unusual.</bad_health>
            </p>
            <p>But where the issue is — to take better care of oneself —<stress reason="money"> well
                    in Brabant I’d wear myself out again taking models, the same old story would
                    start all over again, and it doesn’t seem to me that any good could come of
                    it.</stress> That way — we’d be straying from the path. So please give me
                permission to come sooner if need be. In fact I’d say right away, if need be. If I
                take a garret in Paris, bring my painting box and drawing materials with me — then
                as far as the work’s concerned I can finish the most pressing things at once — those
                studies of plaster casts that will certainly help me when I go to Cormon’s. <work
                    origin="new" stage="planned">I can go and draw either in the Louvre or in
                    L’Ecole des BeauxArts.</work></p>
            <p>For the rest, we could then also think about it and discuss it so much better before
                we go about setting ourselves up somewhere else.</p>
            <p>Know that I don’t mind going to Nuenen in the month of March if need be and seeing
                how things are there, and how the people are, and whether or not I can get
                models.</p>
            <p>But if that doesn’t work out, which is likely, then after March I could come straight
                to Paris and start drawing, in the Louvre, for instance. I’ve given a lot of thought
                to what you wrote about taking a studio — but it seems to me that it would be a good
                thing if we were to look for it together and that before we start living together
                permanently — did it for a while — provisionally — and I started by renting a garret
                at the beginning of April, say, until June. Then I’ll be more accustomed to Paris
                again by the time I go to Cormon’s. </p>
            <p>And — I think this way I’ll remain more cheerful. I also have to tell you that
                although I still go there — <stress reason="friendship">it’s often insupportable for
                    me, the carping of the fellows at the academy, for it has proved that they’re
                    still spiteful.</stress> However, I make a point of avoiding any quarrel, and go
                my own way. And I think I’m getting on the track of what I’m looking for, and
                perhaps I might find it even sooner if I were to sit in front of the plaster casts
                entirely on my own. All the same, I’m glad I went to the academy, if only because I
                have ample opportunity to observe the results of starting from the outline, because
                they do that systematically and they pick petty quarrels with me about it. Make an
                outline first — your outline isn’t right — I won’t correct that if you model before
                having conscientiously finished your outline. You see, it all comes down to that.
                And you really should see!!! how flat, how dead and how bloody boring the results of
                that system are. Oh, I tell you, I’m very glad to have seen it properly at close
                quarters — David or even worse — Pieneman in full bloom. I must have wanted to say
                at least twentyfive times — your outline’s just a trick — but I haven’t thought it
                worthwhile arguing. All the same, even though I don’t say anything, I irritate them
                — and they me.</p>
            <p>This doesn’t matter so much, though — the issue is to really go on trying to find a
                better system of working. So, patience and perseverance.</p>
            <p>They go so far as to say — colour and modelling, that’s nothing, one learns that very
                quickly — it’s the outline that’s the essential thing and the most difficult. You
                see, one can learn something new at the academy — I never knew before that colour
                and modelling came of their own accord. <work origin="new" stage="finished">Just
                    yesterday I finished a drawing that I’ve made for the competition in the evening
                    class. It’s the Germanicus figure that you know.</work> Very well — I know for
                sure that I’ll certainly come last, because all the drawings by the others are the
                same, and mine is completely different. But I saw the drawing that will be
                considered to be the best being done — I was sitting just behind — and it’s correct,
                it’s anything you like, but it’s dead and so are all those drawings that I saw.</p>
            <p>Enough about this — just let it bore us so much that we become enthusiastic about
                something nobler. And that we make haste to achieve it.</p>
            <p>You also need to take better care of yourself, and should we succeed in uniting, the
                two of us would know more than each one individually, and could do more.</p>
            <p>Tell me, did you notice that subtle remark of Paul Mantz’s — women are perhaps the
                supreme difficulty in life — it was in the article on Baudry? We’ll certainly
                experience our share of that, aside from what we may already have experienced. It
                struck me in a chapter from Zola’s L’oeuvre in Gil Blas — that the painter — Manet,
                of course — had a scene with a woman who had posed for him and had then cooled to
                the idea; oh curiously well described. What one can learn at the academy in this
                regard is — just don’t paint women then. They hardly ever use nude female models,
                not at all in class at any rate — very occasionally individually.</p>
            <p>Even in the plaster cast class, 10 male figures as against 1 female figure. That’s
                nice and easy.</p>
            <p>That must surely be better in Paris — and it occurs to me that one actually learns so
                much by constantly comparing male and female, which are always so very different in
                everything. It may be the supreme difficulty, but what would art and what would life
                be without that? Regards, write back about this soon, with a handshake.</p>

            <p>My being in Nuenen, at least for the month of March, would be because of the move,
                and I ought to go there for myself because of changing my abode. But if need be, as
                far as I’m concerned, I’d be prepared not to go back at all.</p>
        </ps>

    </letter>
    <letter>
        <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
        <body>
            <p>I have to write to you one more time because the sooner we can take an outright
                decision the better. As regards a studio — if we could find, in one and the same
                house, a room with an alcove and also a garret or a corner attic — then you could
                have that apartment of room and alcove, and we could make it just as comfortable as
                possible. And during the day the room could serve as studio, and the garret could
                serve for various more unsightly tools or for dirty work, and I could also sleep
                there — and you in the studio alcove.</p>
            <p>It seems to me that such an arrangement or something similar would be perfectly
                satisfactory for the first year. <stress reason="family">What I’m not sure about is
                    whether we’ll get on personally, although I don’t despair of it — but it’ll be
                    much more agreeable for you to come home to a workplace than to an ordinary
                    room, which always has something gloomy about it. And it’s that gloom that’s our
                    worst enemy.</stress> When the doctor tells me that I have to take better care
                of myself, physically — well, who knows whether such a measure mightn’t do you good
                too. <bad_health>For you’re also neither happy nor in good spirits — let’s not mince
                    words, you have too much worry and too little prosperity.</bad_health></p>
            <p>But perhaps it’s because of our policy that we’re each too much alone and our forces
                and resources are too divided, and in that form insufficient. So — unity is strength
                — would certainly be much better.</p>
            <p>So there has to be more life, it seems to me, and we have to throw out all sorts of
                doubts and a certain lack of confidence.</p>
            <p>Do you want a reason on which one can rely to preserve one’s serenity, even when one
                stands alone and isn’t understood and one’s material wellbeing has gone by the
                board? Well there’s still this — I believe — one feels instinctively that a
                tremendous amount is changing, and everything will change. <stress
                    reason="environment">We’re in the last quarter of a century that will end with
                    another colossal revolution.But suppose we both yet see the beginning of it at
                    the end of our lives.</stress></p>
            <p>We’ll certainly not experience the better times of clear air and refreshment of the
                whole of society after those great storms. All the same, it’s something not to be
                taken in by the falseness of one’s time, in so far as one detects in it the
                unhealthy closeness and mugginess of the hours that precede the thunderstorm.</p>
            <p>And says — it’s oppressive for us — but the next generations will be able to breathe
                more freely. Men like Zola and the De Goncourts believe in it with the simplicity of
                overgrown children. They, the most rigorous analysts — whose diagnosis is both so
                merciless and so accurate.</p>
            <p>And particularly the one you mentioned, Turgenev, and Daudet — they don’t work
                without a goal or without looking towards the other side.</p>
            <p>Only they all, and rightly, avoid prophesying utopias and are pessimists in so far as
                if one analyzes, one sees so terribly in the history of this century the way the
                revolutions fail, no matter how nobly they begin.</p>
            <p>You see, where one gets support is when one doesn’t always have to walk alone with
                one’s feelings and thoughts, when one works and thinks in a group of people
                together. Then at the same time one can do more — and one is infinitely happier.</p>
            <p>Well I’d already wanted to have that between us for a long time, and you see, I
                imagine that if you stayed on your own you’d become depressed because the times
                aren’t encouraging unless one finds satisfaction in one’s work. I’m sending you that
                novel by De Goncourt specifically for the introduction above all — which contains a
                résumé of their works and aims.</p>
            <p>Y<bad_health>ou’ll see that these fellows haven’t been precisely happy, in the same
                    way as Delacroix said about himself, I haven’t been happy at all in the sense in
                    which I understood it / wanted it in the past</bad_health>.</p>
            <p>Well, whether or not it comes soon — a moment will come for you, too, when you’ll be
                sure that material wellbeing has gone by the board, fatally and irrevocably. I’d
                safely dare say that, but adding this, that I think that at that same moment there
                will be a certain compensation of feeling a capacity for work.</p>
            <p>What touches me is the magnificent serenity of the great thinkers of the present day,
                like, say, the last walk of the two De Goncourts, which you’ll find described. The
                last days of the ageing Turgenev were like that, too — he was with Daudet a great
                deal then. Sensitive, subtle, intelligent as women, sensitive to their own
                suffering, too, and always still full of life and selfassurance, no indifferent
                stoicism, no contempt for life — I say again, those fellows, they die like women
                die. No idée fixe about God or abstractions — always on the ground floor of life
                itself and attached only to that, again, like women who have loved much — touched
                and — as Silvestre says of Delacroix — thus died, almost smiling.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, we haven’t yet reached that point, on the contrary we’re at the point of
                working first, living first — most likely with the normal kind of wellbeing going by
                the board. But whatever the future may be, you can be sure that I’d be very pleased
                indeed if I could work with Cormon for a year or so, unless there’s somewhere better
                for drawing in L’Ecole des BeauxArts or other studios I’ve heard about here.</p>
            <p>The ancients won’t prevent us from being realistic, come on — on the contrary. Of
                course I’m also desperately longing for French paintings.</p>
            <p>
                <stress reason="love">Apropos, don’t you like this?Everything that is bad came from
                    woman — Clouded Reason, an appetite for lucre, betrayal Golden cups in which
                    wines are mixed with lees. Every crime, every happy lie, every kind of
                    madness</stress>

            <p>Comes from her..... Adore her none the less, since the gods Made her... and — she is
                the best thing that they have made. After all, working has the secret of being able
                to give someone a second youth.</p>
            <p>Tell me, have you ever read anything by Carlyle? Actually that’s not necessary when
                one sees the fellow’s face and knows his work is something like Michelet. Whistler
                and Legros have both made his portrait. That’s another one who dared a great deal
                and had a different insight on many things from the rest. But the more I look into
                it, always the same story — lack of money, poor health, opposition, isolation, in
                short, trouble from beginning to end.</p>
            <p>Mantz’s piece about Paul Baudry was very good, and I found that ‘he worked on the
                renewal of the smile’ particularly singular.</p>
            <p>Could one say of Delacroix ‘he worked on the renewal of passion’? Perhaps so. Anyway
                — do write soon in any event, and regards.</p>

            <p>
                <good_health>I don’t know whether we’ll earn money, but if it’s just enough to work

            <p>Yes, we must do the miners one day!What did Portier say about the potato eaters? I
                know myself that there are flaws in it; all the same, precisely because I see that

                <stress reason="family">I suppose you already know that Pa has turned down
                    Helvoirt.</stress>
            </p>
            <p>The people here gave Pa a present of about 200 guilders, that’s most kind and I’m
                pleased for them.</p>
            <p>The decision wasn’t a matter of indifference to me — since I wouldn’t have gone with
                them to H. in any case, and would either have stayed here in my studio — or would
                have left for Antwerp. <unstress reason="friendship">Now — as far as I can see, the
                    best thing for me is simply to carry on as things are — and stay here. It has
                    truly not been going too badly for me lately. It’s true that I can’t make
                    anything financially from my work here — but I’m making really good friends here

            <p><work stage="finished" origin="new">Last week I painted still lifes day in and day

            <p>But for my part, I also have to do something to keep on good terms with them.</p>
            <p>But I can’t see that I lose by it, since I work more enjoyably because I have some
                conversation. Hermans has so many beautiful objects — like old jars and other
                antiques — that I wanted to ask you whether I could oblige you by painting a still
                life for your room of some of these objects — Gothic things, for instance.</p>
            <p>The ones I’ve been making with Hermans so far are simpler. But just today he said to
                me that if I ever want to make a painting for myself of things that are still too
                difficult for him to do as a study, I can take the objects with me to the studio.
                Please let me have an answer to this — and if you would like it, I’ll make it for
                you and shall select really nice things.</p>

                at all feasible for you. Because otherwise it will soon become very difficult, and
                the work will suffer more than necessary.</p>
            <p>And I’ll give it back to you with my work. That’s all I can say about it.</p>
            <p>At all events I’ll ask Hermans for those objects — and make something for you with

        <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
        <body>
            <p>Thanks for your letter and for the church’s attestation, it’s a pity you didn’t go to
                Etten for Whitsun; I sincerely hope you’ll be able to go one Sunday soon. Did you
                get the attestation easily? Thanks for taking the trouble. </p>
            <p> Yesterday morning I went to the early service and heard a sermon, ‘I shall not
                always strive with man’, how after a time of disappointment and grief in life a time
                may come when one’s innermost desires and wishes may be fulfilled. At 10 in the
                morning I heard Uncle Stricker on Acts II:14, the pouring forth of the Holy Spirit.
                A very beautiful, warm address from the heart; this morning I’m going to hear Uncle
                again and must go now, I’ll write and tell you presently what his text was. </p>
            <p> It’s rainy today, and a long walk along Buitenkant to the Noorderkerk. <unstress
                    reason="environment">There, by the Schreijerstoren, where one has a view of the
                    IJ, the city looked like a painting by J. Maris.</unstress> The text was I
                Corinthians 12:13, For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body. There are
                some beautiful churches here. This week I walked as far as the Zuiderzee on a dyke
                going to Zeeburg. This takes one past the Jodenkerkhof, which I visited as well.
                It’s very simple, full of old tombstones standing upright with Hebrew inscriptions
                and elderberries here and there, and covered with long, dark grass. <unstress
                    reason="environment">Yesterday (Sunday) afternoon I went with Uncle Jan to
                    Baarn, how beautiful it is there, we walked in the wood in the avenues of spruce
                    and beech trees and saw the sun go down behind the oak copse. You can imagine
                    how beautiful it is in the evening, around the time we came home yesterday, for
                    example, at the wharf and the dockyard and the shore of the IJ, and there’s such
                    a glorious smell of tar in the air that reminds one of pinewoods.
                </unstress></p>
            <p> Yesterday Uncle gave me some old black gloves and scarves. Thought we’d share them
                in brotherly fashion. You’ll receive them in a day or two as ‘samples without
                value’, because black gloves are a good thing, good like ivy, for example, and
                ‘mosses green and lichens fair’, and good like the fixed habit of going to church. </p>
            <p> This afternoon I’m going to Uncle Stricker’s, who asked me to come, Vos, Kee and
                Paul’s girl will be there too. </p>
            <p> Do you know an old English engraving ‘The vicar’s daughter’? It’s hanging at Baarn
                and struck me yesterday; look out for it if you come to Baarn. Its atmosphere
                recalls Die Abendglocke. </p>
            <p> Nevertheless, I find it such a pity that there, as well as in Uncle Jan’s best
                rooms, there is nothing hanging like Christus Consolator or Ecce Homo. The latter is
                hanging in your room, surely, at least I thought I noticed it there. Do make a habit
                of hanging it up everywhere you live, for that is right and is your due. </p>
            <p> This morning in church I saw a little old woman, probably the footstove woman, who
                reminded me so much of that etching by Rembrandt, a woman who has been reading the
                Bible and has fallen asleep leaning her head on her hand. C. Blanc writes about it
                so beautifully and with so much feeling, and I think Michelet does as well in his:
                there is no such thing as an old woman. The poem by De Génestet, ‘Haar pad in ’t
                leven loopt eenzaam af’ also reminds me of it. Will we also find ourselves in the
                evening of our life before we know it, as it were? – when we feel the days flying
                by, passing ever more quickly – it helps me to believe and trust that ‘man proposes,
                but God disposes’. </p>
            <p> Were you at the gallery in the mornings over the Whitsun holidays? I do hope you had
                a good time all the same. </p>
            <p> 22 May. Yesterday evening I was at Uncle Stricker’s, where it was very convivial.
                Vos, Kee, Paul’s girl and Jan were there, and it was after 11 when I got home, then
                I wrote until 12, how I wish that we could go to places together, I’d have liked you
                to be with us last night.Do write a few words again soon, when you have a moment.
                    <good_health>This morning I still have a lot of work to do, I see that it isn’t
                    easy and will no doubt become much more difficult, yet have unfaltering hope
                    that I’ll succeed, and I’m also convinced that I’ll learn to work by working,
                    and that my work will become better and more substantial.</good_health> I’ve
                already begun studying the Bible, but only in the evenings, when I’ve finished my
                work for the day, or early in the morning – after all, that’s the most important
                thing – even though it’s now my duty to dedicate myself to studying other things,
                which I do, of course.Yesterday at the Strickers’ I had to tell them about London
                and Paris, and whenever I do that I see it all before me again, all things from that
                past can also work together for good, I’m fond of much there, and that, ah, I’ve
                experienced that everywhere I’ve been, I also feel that when I walk the streets of
                The Hague or Zundert, for example, I shan’t easily forget that last journey there.
                Before I went to the Strickers’ I walked briefly through the Trippenhuis in order to
                see several paintings again, I’m sure you know which ones. </p>
            <p>Now, Theo, give my regards to one person or another you might see, write soon, I wish
                you the very best, accept a firm handshake in thought, and believe me.</p>

        <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
        <body>
            <p>I was in the middle of writing to you to send you the reply for Mr Aurier when your
                letter arrived. <unstress reason="family">Am very pleased that Jo and the newborn
                    are well and that she expects to be able to get up in a few days from
                    now.</unstress> Then what you write about our sister also interests me a great
                deal. I consider that she was lucky to see Degas at his home. I still think that she
                would above all make a good doctor’s wife. Anyway, one can’t exactly force these
                things, nevertheless it’s good to have one’s eyes open if the opportunity were to
                present itself.</p>
            <p>And so Gauguin has come back to Paris – I’m going to copy my reply to Mr Aurier to
                send it to him, and you can let him read the article from the Mercure. For really I
                consider that one should say things like that about Gauguin, and about me nothing
                except very secondarily.</p>
            <p>
                <stress reason="friendship">Gauguin wrote to me that he’d exhibited in Denmark and
                    that this exhibition had been very successful. To me it seems a shame that he
                    didn’t continue here a bit longer. The two of us together would have worked
                    better than myself all alone this year. And at present we’d have a little
                    cottage of our own to stay in and work, and could even accommodate
                    others.</stress>
            </p>
            <p>Did you notice in that newspaper you sent me an article on the fruitfulness of
                certain artists. Of Corot, Rousseau, Dupré; do you remember how many times when Reid
                was there that we talked about that, even of the necessity to produce a lot.</p>
            <p>And that shortly after I came to Paris I said to you that before I had two hundred
                canvases I wouldn’t be able to do anything. What would appear to some people to be
                working too fast is in reality completely the ordinary run of things, the normal
                state of regular production, considering that a painter must work really just as
                hard as a shoemaker, for example. Would it not be a good idea to send Reid, and
                perhaps also Tersteeg, or rather C.M., a copy of Aurier’s article?</p>
            <p>The thing is that it seems to me that we ought to take advantage of it to try to
                place something in Scotland, either now or later.</p>
            <p>
                <work origin="new" stage="finished">I think you’ll like the canvas for Mr Aurier,
                    it’s in terribly thick impasto and worked like certain Monticellis, I’ve kept it
                    for almost a year.</work>
            </p>
            <p>But I consider that I must try to give him something good for that article, which is
                in itself a very artistic thing; and it really serves us well for the day when we,
                like everyone, will be obliged to try and recover what the paintings cost.</p>
            <p>Everything beyond that leaves me quite cold, but recovering the money it costs to
                produce, that’s the very condition of being able to continue.</p>
            <p>
                <work stage="middle" origin="new">For the Impressionists’ exhibition in March I hope
                    to send you a few more canvases which are drying at the moment. If they didn’t
                    arrive in time you would have to make a choice from those that are at père
                    Tanguy’s. I’ve tried to copy Daumier’s Drinkers and Doré’s Penitentiary, it’s
                    very difficult.</work>
            </p>
            <p>
                <work origin="new" stage="planned">In the next few days I hope to begin on
                    Delacroix’s Good Samaritan and Millet’s Woodcutter.</work>
            </p>
            <p>Aurier’s article would encourage me, if I dared let myself go, to risk emerging from
                reality more and making a kind of tonal music with colour, as some Monticellis are.
                But the truth is so dear to me, trying to create something true also, anyway I
                think, I think I still prefer to be a shoemaker than to be a musician, with colours.
                In any event, trying to remain true is perhaps a remedy to combat the illness that
                still continues to worry me. Lately my health is quite good, however, and I’d dare
                to believe that if I were to spend a while with you that would have a lot of effect
                upon me to counteract the influence that the company I have here necessarily exerts.
                But it seems to me that there’s no hurry about this, and that we must consider
                calmly if this is the moment to spend money on the journey. Perhaps by sacrificing
                the journey one could be useful to Gauguin or Lauzet.</p>
            <p>
                <stress reason="money">A few days ago I bought a suit that cost me 35 francs, I must
                    pay for it towards the end of March. With this I’ll have sufficient for the
                    year, for when I came here I also bought a suit for around 35 francs, and it has
                    served me all year. But I’ll need a pair of shoes and a few pairs of drawers in
                    March as well.</stress>
            </p>
            <p>All things considered, life here isn’t very expensive, I think that in the north one
                would spend rather more.</p>
            <p>And that’s why – even if I came to you for a while – the best policy might still be
                to continue the work here. I don’t know – and either is good to me – but we mustn’t
                hurry to move.</p>
            <p>And don’t you think that in Antwerp, if we put Gauguin’s plan into practice, one
                would have to maintain a certain rank, furnish a studio, in short do as the majority
                of established Dutch painters do? It’s not as simple as it appears, and would fear
                for him as well as for myself a regular siege by the established artists, and he
                would have the same story as he had before in Denmark. Anyway, we’d have to begin to
                say to ourselves that it’s still through the same procedure that the established
                painters can cause troubles for adventurers, as we’d be in Antwerp, and even oblige
                them to decamp. And as for the dealers there, we mustn’t count on them at all.</p>
            <p>The academy there is better, and they work more vigorously there than in Paris. And
                then Gauguin is still in Paris at the moment, his reputation is holding up there,
                and if he leaves for Antwerp he could find that it’s rather difficult to come back
                to Paris. Going to Antwerp I would fear for Gauguin rather than for myself, for
                naturally I can get by in Flemish, I resume the studies of peasants I began before
                and abandoned with much regret – there’s no need to tell you that I have a great
                love of the Kempen. But I foresee that for him the battle could be very tough. I
                think that you’ll tell him the pros and cons of this absolutely as<stress
                    reason="friendship"> I would tell him, I’ll write to him one of these days,
                    especially to send him the reply to Mr Aurier’s article, and I’d think that if
                    he wanted we could still work here together if his steps to find a position were
                    to come to nothing.</stress> But he’s skilful, and perhaps he’ll come through it
                in Paris itself, and if he holds on there for his reputation he does well, for he
                always has this, that he was the first one of all to work in the heart of a tropical
                land. And one will necessarily come back to that matter. Above all, give him my warm
                regards, and if he wants he can take the repetitions of the Sunflowers and the
                repetition of the Berceuse in exchange for something of his that would give you
                pleasure.</p>
            <p><work stage="planned" origin="existing">If I came to Paris I would have to rework
                    several canvases done in the beginning here, I wouldn’t have any lack of work
                    then.</work> Warm regards to Jo, and good handshake in thought.</p>

    <letter>
        <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
        <body>
            <p>Thanks for your letter of today, I have to do a few things and so am writing in
                haste. Gave your letter to Uncle Jan, accept his warm regards and he thanks you for
                writing.</p>
            <p>
                <bad_health>There were some words in your letter that touched me, ‘I should really
                    like to get away from everything, I’m the cause of everything and only make
                    others sad, I alone have caused all this misery to myself and others’. Those
                    were words that touched me – because that same feeling, exactly the same,
                    nothing more and nothing less, is also on my conscience.</bad_health>
            </p>
            <p>When I think of the past – when I think of the future, <bad_health>of nearly
                    insurmountable difficulties, of much and difficult work which I have no passion
                    for</bad_health>, which I – <bad_health>the evil part of me</bad_health>, that
                is – would prefer to avoid, when I think of the eyes of so many that are fixed upon
                me – who, if I do not succeed, will know the reason why – <stress reason="career"
                    >who will not utter any ordinary reproaches but who, because they have been
                    tried and are well versed in what is good and proper and fine gold, as it were,
                    will say it by the expression on their faces: we helped you and have been a
                    light unto you – we did for you what we could. Did you sincerely desire it? What
                    are our wages and the fruits of our labours? You see, when I think of all that
                    and of so much else, all manner of things – too many to mention, of all the
                    troubles and worries which do not become less as one progresses through life, of
                    suffering, of disappointment, of the danger of failing to a scandalous extent,
                    then that desire is no stranger to me either – I would really like to get away
                    from everything!</stress></p>
            <p>And yet – I go on – but with caution and in the hope that I’ll succeed in warding off
                all these things, so that I can somehow answer all the reproaches that threaten,
                    <good_health>trusting that in spite of everything that seems to be against me I
                    shall attain that thing that I desire, and, God willing, shall find grace in the
                    eyes of some whom I love, and in the eyes of those who shall come after
                    me.</good_health></p>
            <p>It is written, lift up the feeble hands, and the knees which hang down, and when the
                disciples had toiled all night and had taken nothing, it was said unto them, Launch
                out into the deep, and let down your nets again.</p>
            <p><bad_health>My head is sometimes numb and is often burning hot, and my thoughts are
                    confused</bad_health> – <stress reason="career">how shall I ever get all that
                    difficult and detailed study into it?</stress> – I don’t know – after those
                turbulent years, becoming accustomed to plain, well-ordered work and persevering in
                it isn’t always easy. <stress reason="career">And yet I go on, if we’re tired, isn’t
                    it because we’ve already gone a long way, and if it’s true that man’s life on
                    earth is a struggle, isn’t feeling tired and having a burning head a sign that
                    we have struggled?</stress> When one labours at difficult work and strives for
                good results, one fights the good fight, the reward of which, surely, is already
                this: that one is preserved from much that is evil. And God beholds the labour and
                the sorrow, and can help in spite of everything. </p>
            <p><good_health>Faith in God is for me a certainty</good_health> – not some notion, not
                an idle belief, it is so, it is true – there is a God that lives – and He is with
                our parents, and his eye is also upon us, and I am certain that He intends us for
                something, and that we do not belong entirely to ourselves, as it were – and that
                God is none other than Christ of Whom we read in our Bible, whose word and story are
                also deep in your heart. <stress reason="career">If only I had worked at it sooner
                    with all my might, yes, it would be better for me now – but even now He will be
                    a mighty help, and it is in His power to make our life bearable, to keep us from
                    evil, to let all things work together for good, to make the end of us
                    peace.</stress> There is evil in the world and in ourselves, terrible things,
                and one doesn’t have to have gone far in life to dread much and to feel the need for
                unfaltering hope in a life after this one, and to know that without faith in a God
                one cannot live – cannot endure. But with that faith one can long endure. And now,
                there are words in our Bible that are emphatically repeated in various places, on
                various occasions, under various circumstances, Fear not, our Father took that to
                heart and he says ‘I never despair’, let us repeat it after him. Isn’t it your
                experience, too, that whenever you wanted to do something bad, you were held back –
                that whenever there was something upsetting you and you saw no way out, you came
                through it all unharmed? A book by Bunyan tells of a traveller who sees a lion lying
                at the side of the road he must traverse – and yet he continues on his way – there
                is nothing else he may or can do – and when he arrives at the place he notices that
                the lion is chained up and is only there to test the travellers’ courage. Thus it is
                in life more than once. There is much in store for us, but others have lived, and so
                whosoever loves his parents must follow them on life’s path. If you value the love
                and esteem of young people, declare your beliefs openly whenever suitable, and admit
                that you love Christ and the Bible, doesn’t a son love his Father better for this
                reason than for any other? Women and children and the simple often feel and know
                these things so deeply, and there is hidden in so many a heart a great and vigorous
                faith. We, too, are in need of this when we think of much that is in store for us,
                He spoke from all His experience of life, and we know how much must have been going
                on in the heart whose plenitude made His mouth utter the words ‘in the Heavenly
                Kingdom they do not marry, and are not given in marriage’, and who said, he who hate
                not, even his own life also, he cannot be My disciple. Yes, those words of the Lord,
                surely they are the words issuing from the mouth of God whereby man shall live – and
                not by bread alone and the more one seeks in those words, the more one shall find
                therein. When I was standing next to Aertsen’s body, the calm and seriousness and
                solemn stillness of death contrasted so greatly with us who were living, that
                everyone felt what his daughter said in her simplicity: he is delivered from the
                burden of life which we must still bear. And yet we are so attached to that old life
                because there is cheerfulness to counter despondency, and our heart and our soul are
                gladdened, just as the lark who cannot help singing in the morning, even if our soul
                is sometimes cast down within us and is disquieted in us. And the memory of
                everything we have loved remains and returns in the evening of our life. It is not
                dead, but sleepeth and it is good to collect a great store of it. Accept a handshake
                in thought, and I wish you the very best, and write again soon to</p>

    <letter>
        <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
        <body>
            <p><work origin="existing" stage="finished">Here are a couple of smaller photos of the
                    studies of which you already have the larger ones. I’m sending them because —
                    should it ever come to it — I want you to be able to show something of
                    mine.</work> Rappard is still here and will be staying for another week since
                the work is going extraordinarily well. He’s making women spinning and various
                studies of heads, has already made 10 studies or so, all of which I consider
                fine.</p>
            <p>We’ve talked together quite a lot about Impressionism — I think that you would
                classify his work as that. But here in Holland it’s hard to work out what
                Impressionism is actually trying to say. But both he and I are greatly interested in
                what the present aim is. And it’s certain that unexpected new ideas are beginning to
                emerge. That paintings are once again beginning to be painted in very different tone
                from a few years ago.</p>
            <p>
                <work stage="finished" origin="new">The last thing I made is a rather large study of
                    an avenue of poplars with the yellow autumn leaves, where the sun makes
                    glittering patches here and there on the fallen leaves on the ground, which are
                    interspersed with the long shadows cast by the trunks. At the end of the road a
                    peasant cottage, and the blue sky above it between the autumn leaves.</work>
            </p>
            <p>I think that in a year’s time — having spent that year once again painting a great
                deal and constantly — I’ll change my manner of painting and my colour a great deal,
                and that I’m likely to become slightly more sombre rather than lighter. The spectrum
                of Rappard’s work has also become much lower.</p>
            <p>The heads that he’s painting at present are reminiscent in their effect of certain
                studies of heads by Courbet, say. But it’s becoming devilish good, that I can assure
                you.</p>
            <p>Because of one thing and another I discussed with him, it may well be that I prefer
                to stay here and carry on working here rather than go somewhere else.<good_health>
                    As a result of his visit I’ve again got new ideas for my own work, and have so
                    many things in my head which I’d like to make that, after all, I can’t easily
                    postpone getting on with them right away.</good_health></p>
            <p><stress reason="money">Besides, I want to settle my paint bills before the New Year,
                    and can’t afford any extra expenditure. </stress>Because if I went to Antwerp
                I’d obviously want to do a lot of work and would need models for it, which I fear
                would work out too dear for the moment.</p>
            <p>But in general Rappard advises me not to do it right away, but after having painted
                here for another few months, and to try to get a piedàterre to make nude
                studies.</p>
            <p>
                <work origin="new" stage="middle">But I’ll be able to benefit more from Antwerp if I
                    first paint another 30 heads here — and I’m starting on those 30 heads now, or
                    rather I’ve already started with a large bust of a shepherd.</work>
            </p>
            <p>Rappard has done the same in Drenthe and on Terschelling this summer, and it has
                helped him to make a good deal of progress.</p>
            <p>I’ve just seen a reproduction of a Lhermitte — The inn — two workmen and a woman, do
                you know it? The last few days R. and I have been on some long excursions, and
                visited people house by house — we’ve seen lots of beautiful things, just because of
                the magnificent autumnal effects. And also discovered new models. Perhaps a few
                other painters might come to this region next year. I wish they would, because one
                shouldn’t go for too long without ever seeing any painters.</p>
            <p>Well — as to that — I’ll get new acquaintances before too long in any event.</p>
            <p>Regards, from Rappard too.</p>

    <letter>
        <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
        <body>
            <p>Many thanks for your letter and the enclosure, and also for what I received for St
                Nicholas too. I want to start by telling you that your letter really amazed me —
                because there has been no difference of any significance between Pa and Ma and
                myself, <stress reason="family">and that as regards the Begemann ladies, they’ve
                    just very recently been to see Pa and Ma in considerable numbers — not just once
                    but several times. Whether they come as often as or less often than before is
                    something I can’t see that I have anything to do with, nor take the least or
                    slightest interest in.</stress></p>
            <p>The fact that I disapprove of their attitude and will certainly continue to do so is
                something that I told them once — succinctly — without reverting to it again.</p>
            <p>
                <stress reason="friendship">But that has nothing further to do with whether or not
                    they come to our house, which concerns not me but Pa and Ma and themselves. I
                    have been courteous to everyone in that family and did not start it but they
                    attacked me and, which bothered me more, Margot — that’s why I’ve absolutely
                    avoided contact with them — precisely because I don’t feel capable of taking
                    back my decided disapproval of their attitude in this matter — or of concealing
                    it.</stress>
            </p>
            <p>What you also know yourself — I say this for clarity, not to cause you sorrow — what
                you also know yourself, that in order to show you how I said what I said with
                composure I deliberately dropped you a brief line that I thought your own opinion
                wrong — (whether it is wrong is for you to decide, but I thought and think it
                wrong).</p>
            <p>So this is my subjective conviction — I have my own ideas in these things — my whys
                and wherefores — which I can feel better for myself than make them clear to you or
                anyone else — particularly when they have neither your attention nor your sympathy.
                    <stress reason="career">Consequently, I let people say and think whatever they
                    will of me more than you might imagine — but you can take this much from me ‘for
                    your guidance’ — that just because I failed in something I don’t admit that I
                    shouldn’t have started it — on the contrary, if I fail many times I find this a
                    reason even if it’s sometimes impossible to continue in exactly the same way —
                    nevertheless to try again in the same direction, since my convictions, too, are
                    considered and intended by me, and I believe that there’s a raison d’être for
                    them.</stress></p>
            <p>For me personally, there’s a cardinal point of distinction between before and after
                the revolution — the reversal of the social position of the woman, and the
                collaboration one wants between men and women with equal rights, with equal
                freedom.</p>
            <p>I have neither the words nor the time to expand on this, nor, in the circumstances,
                the inclination. But enough, to my mind conventional morality is all backtofront and
                I hope it will be turned around and replaced in time.</p>
            <p>Now — as to what you say about yourself, probably also for my guidance, ‘that you are
                mistrustful’ — very well — I don’t want to influence that. You’ve most certainly
                shown me this — and it’s one of those ‘symptoms’ which I told you I didn’t find very
                attractive nor congratulated you on.</p>
            <p>But this, too, is a subjective opinion if you will. So go ahead, be mistrustful or
                not mistrustful as the mood takes you, I will in any event see to it that I accept
                the consequences for me, and can otherwise only refer you to what I said about
                standing on different sides of a barricade. <stress reason="family">Do what you want
                    according to your principles — but I’ll act according to mine, and only — if
                    possible, let’s avoid aiming at each other because we’re brothers. I’m older
                    than you, and I’ve probably experienced some things differently and interpreted
                    them differently from you. And this is my own responsibility, of course. That I
                    can’t approve of everything I see you do or hear you say is something very
                    different from wanting to bring you round to my point of view. It’s just — I
                    like to lay my cards on the table.</stress></p>
            <p>And bearing in mind that we must see to it that we avoid putting a spoke in each
                other’s wheels, I will, as I said, increasingly try to find other contacts or
                connections in Eindhoven, in Antwerp, in short, wherever I can.</p>
            <p>But this can’t be done all at once — and for my part it’s simply and solely because
                you’ve shown me all too clearly and unmistakably that I mustn’t imagine that you
                intend to involve yourself with me personally or with my work other than by way of
                patronage. Well, you can count me out. <stress reason="family">And while, without
                    words, without sympathy, I’ve received the money very regularly but very coolly
                    each month, I have — kept working — but — increasingly realizing that a moment
                    could come when we each go our own way instead of the same way together.
                    </stress><stress reason="money">I don’t suppose in the least that I’ll gain by
                    it financially — but — as soon as some dealer or other, however much of a
                    cheapjack — gives me board and, even if it’s a tiny attic, lodgings and some
                    paint, I’ll sell myself with great pleasure — if you choose to call it selling.
                    Preferable to patronage. </stress>There you see my cards on the table. And
                whether I’ll succeed in this and when? <stress reason="career">I can’t say
                    precisely, but — I work too hard for me to be so very far away from it. I want,
                    precisely because I foresee that if our paths ever lead us to the same place we
                    might well find ourselves considerably at odds — I want you not to be able to
                    blame me then for being dependent on you. I’m still in two minds as to what I
                    should try to do — but I’ll most probably not stay here after all — and then
                    where to go will be the question.</stress></p>
            <p><stress reason="family">I don’t think that you’ll approve of my coming to Paris — but
                    what can I do about it? You flatly refuse to look after my interests </stress>—
                very well — but I can’t just leave it at that. I wouldn’t have thought of it if you
                had written less decidedly that it was beneath you, but now — well, now — I can take
                no notice of you.</p>
            <p>In short, I don’t want to exchange the chance (even if it is only a chance) of making
                it, not even for the certainty of patronage which is, after all, rather tight.</p>
            <p>Since I see that I’m forfeiting my chance of selling by continuing to take the money
                from you, we must just part. <stress reason="money">Don’t you find it very
                    understandable that, when I hear you say that you can’t do anything with my work
                    for the next few years, I then get the slight sense that, if you want to remain
                    high and mighty on this point, there’s a rather odd contradiction if — precisely
                    because I’m not selling, however hard I work — I’m forced to say, Theo, I’m 25
                    guilders short, couldn’t you let me have a bit extra, then this proves not to be
                    possible.</stress></p>
            <p>This is very contrary of you: when one sends you something or one asks, please, try
                to find an opening with the illustrated magazines so that I can earn something extra
                — one hears no more about it and you don’t lift a finger.</p>
            <p>But one may not say, I can’t manage on my money.</p>
            <p>And up to now — all right — but to carry on — impossible. I also want to tell you
                that I shan’t be asking you whether you approve or disapprove of anything I do or
                don’t do — I won’t be embarrassed and, if I feel like going to Paris, for instance,
                I shan’t ask you whether or not you object. <stress reason="money">The drawback to
                    painting is the paint bill. And at the moment I’m having a far from easy time
                    with it. I already immediately paid out 40 guilders (80 francs) of what was
                    sent. Moreover also paid the carpenter for things. So that if, after deduction
                    of what you had to pay, you still had 100 francs left — I have less than 25
                    francs left, and although I don’t have to live on it at the moment, as you do, I
                    still have to paint on it for a month, which, with models, with paints, is
                    impossible this way.</stress></p>
            <p>And I also have this pleasing prospect for January, when I’ll have to pay some more.
                    <stress reason="money">So what I’m complaining about and why I said that it was
                    actually most decidedly essential that I had something extra now and not later
                    was so that I could for God’s sake at least keep working, and if I’m definitely
                    stuck for financial reasons, it makes me very discontented. And for which I
                    can’t then accordingly blame myself alone, because what I have to pay isn’t
                    caused by extravagance but by working.</stress> If you can’t enter into this or
                sympathize, and choose to be mistrustful — well, old chap — I believe you really
                mean well and so — I really don’t take your mistrustfulness too much to heart.
                Except to the extent that if you’re doing it deliberately to get rid of me, you’re
                truly well on the way to achieving that goal.</p>
            <p>In the past you know that I often specifically asked you that we should keep up the
                relationship — now I could no longer urge it in the same way. <stress
                    reason="career">Again, I work too hard for me to have to remain for much longer
                    in a dependent position which degenerates too much into patronage, while when I
                    write about it in a businesslike way I don’t even get an answer. No — old chap —
                    seeing something in it that I may continue to regard as lasting is no longer
                    reconcilable with my sense of honour, of justice.</stress></p>
            <p>Listen — Pa — has been very often and very seriously — mistrustful — of me. You know
                your side of that anyway, and I for my part perhaps know even more about it. But —
                nonetheless — he always called himself ‘my friend’ nonetheless — the man thought
                that he was right and simply couldn’t see any differently — and — so, after all —
                meant well if you will — namely.</p>
            <p>
                <stress reason="family">But for my part, one day I spoke out foursquare and said,
                    don’t call yourself my friend if you think this or that of me — people who think
                    of me like that, they’re not friends but enemies, the worst enemies as sure as 2
                    x 2 = 4. This also applies to you in answer to what you say about mistrust. With
                    this distinction (which I’m willing to appreciate and take into account), Pa did
                    not add ‘that he was mistrustful’, you add that — which makes up for a lot. Yet
                    at bottom I still see the same thing in it.</stress>
            </p>
            <p>Now I don’t want to influence anything, though — and I say bluntly that on my part I
                don’t in the least undertake to agree with Pa or you. Be aware of that — quite
                possibly there’s even more than a ditch between the two. And because something of
                the kind is quite possible, be aware that I absolutely do not urge you to think all
                sorts of fine and good things about me according to your or Pa’s view of things. It
                might well be that mine is opposed to them in a revolutionary way. I can’t worry
                about what people think of me — I must move forward, that’s what I have to think
                about.And so I go my way with a certain obstinacy, believing in some things and not
                in others. You — and rightly — set store by your position — don’t you? — by making
                progress or not making progress — your affairs going poorly or well. Well now, know
                that I too shall certainly stand up for my profession with no weaker motive than you
                have for yours. And without going about it all too delicately, must and will
                persevere. And also very certainly think to keep on my studio here — like Stengelin
                does, for instance, who has one on the Drenthe heaths — even if he happens to live
                somewhere else. I’ve rented it as a refuge and it will continue to serve me as
                such.</p>
            <p><stress reason="money">So — taking rooms in Eindhoven would be sheer nonsense — and I
                    can’t even think about it. A room in Antwerp later on, all right — that is
                    indeed my intention — but firstly I don’t have any money for it now</stress>,
                and secondly <work origin="new" stage="planned">I still want to paint a fairly large
                    number of heads first</work> —<stress reason="money"> with which I’ll make
                    progress — to the extent that it’s at all possible for me to pay the
                    models.</stress> Which in the circumstances, as you say, things don’t exactly
                foster. I can’t do any silly things just like that in the circumstances, and cook my
                own goose by breaking off here at a moment that doesn’t lend itself to it — just
                because you’re in a mistrustful period. But be aware of this, that if this
                mistrustful period endures with you and seems about to take root — even if I don’t
                do any silly things just like that — I’m nonetheless seriously thinking of seeing to
                it that we can part in peace and without damage to you or me.However, my very
                sincere thanks each time for what is sent, and know that if I press for a little
                extra — it’s precisely in order to continue until we can part, but — in peace — and
                without harm to you or me.Theo. Although appreciating your proposal to add another
                50 francs monthly over and above the 100 francs I asked for, intended as a
                contribution to Pa towards the cost of my keep, I must most decidedly refuse this
                (the 50 francs). If I’ve been here at home this long without paying for my board and
                lodging, you may regard that if you will as arrogance or tactlessness on my part. I
                did it for the sake of the progress of the painting, and have not profited from it
                myself in so far as even now I still have a fairly steep paint bill to pay, as
                surplus expenditure. Apart from that, I acknowledge that it has been advantageous to
                me after all.</p>
            <p>
                <stress reason="career">But the reason why I don’t think now is a suitable moment to
                    make a sort of contract with Pa is that under the circumstances it cannot be
                    part of my plans to intend to stay here for very much longer. Which I would like
                    but, I must fear, will prove impossible.</stress>
            </p>
            <p>However, if you do want to agree something with Pa to the effect you indicate in your
                letter, let it be without involving me at all and in other words a matter between
                you and Pa which concerns me not at all.</p>
            <p>So that I can then continue to regard the fact that I live here as tactlessness on my
                part in all events, thus also in the event of payment by you.</p>
            <p>When I’m better I’ll probably go and live in the studio, at least in the daytime.</p>
            <p>
                <stress reason="money">It’s too much for me all at once, losing you in this respect,
                    and having to pay for my keep again as well. Gradually, though, I’ll see to it
                    that I find another resource of my own accord.</stress>
            </p>
            <p><stress reason="career">If it can give you any satisfaction that what you call ‘my
                    plans for the future’ are also lying pretty much in ruins,</stress> good luck to
                you. However, this is still no reason for me to approve of your views in this
                regard, which, I must repeat, I continue to find bad.</p>
            <p><stress reason="money">I cannot give up the studio yet — I have to have something
                    fixed, and they can’t in any event demand of me that I leave the village. The
                    fact that it can be foreseen that I have to prepare myself for this, though, is
                    precisely the point that makes me regret that I didn’t already realize last year
                    that our arrangement was unsustainable for both of us. </stress>Regards.VincentI
                must object to an underlined section in your letter — which I copy.</p>
            <p>‘And I therefore request you, from now on, out of the 150 francs, which I shall keep
                on sending you, as agreed when we were good friends, it was accepted by us both to
                give 50 francs to Pa.’</p>
            <p>
                <stress reason="money">I object to that, it’s not true that ‘when we were still good
                    friends’ and we agreed that I should pay 50 francs. I remember the conversation
                    about it — in the garden — very well, and far from agreeing to something, I
                    wasn’t willing to agree to anything of that sort then, on that occasion, and it
                    ended with my pointing out to you fairly forcefully that I needed money to get
                    started on several larger canvases I was planning, and had other expenses
                    enough. If anything was agreed, it was for later, when I would be more on top of
                    things.</stress>
            </p>
            <p>This letter tells you explicitly that I flatly refuse to have anything to do with
                what you might want to agree with Pa about possible payment for board.</p>
            <p>
                <stress reason="money">Now in order to avoid further misunderstanding in this
                    regard, about this 50 francs for board, I let Pa read your letter of today and
                    this letter. I don’t want to hear any more about this matter; you settle it with
                    Pa. I tell you once more, it’s not true I agreed to pay 50 francs for my board,
                    if I had promised that I would have kept to it, but I remember the whole
                    conversation about it and it’s simply the opposite, namely that I told you that
                    for the time being I had too much else to pay, that I couldn’t do it
                    yet.</stress>

        <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
        <body>
            <p>
                <work origin="existing" stage="finished">Today I sent off that little crate,
                    containing 1 other painting, Peasant cemetery, besides what I already told
                    you.</work>
            </p>
            <p>I’ve left out some details — I wanted to say how this ruin shows that for centuries
                the peasants have been laid to rest there in the very fields that they grubbed up in
                life — I wanted to say how perfectly simply death and burial happen, coolly as the
                falling of an autumn leaf — no more than a bit of earth turned over — a little
                wooden cross. The fields around — where the grass of the churchyard ends, beyond the
                little wall, they make a last fine line against the horizon — like the horizon of a
                sea. And now this ruin says to me how a faith and religion mouldered away, although
                it was solidly founded — how, though, the life and death of the peasants is and will
                always be the same, springing up and withering regularly like the grass and the
                flowers that grow there in that churchyard. Victor Hugo, whom they’ve also just
                buried, said Religions pass, God remains.I don’t know whether you’ll see anything in
                these two things — the cottage with the mossy roof reminded me of a wren’s nest.
                Anyway, you must just look at them.</p>
            <p>Now I must take this opportunity of explaining to you again — which I found new,
                clear words for — why I wrote and write to you that I’m still far from sure whether
                your present view is your definite conviction. The firm of G(and)Cie isn’t a good
                school for getting to know paintings, let alone painters. I tell you this as my
                opinion — that one doesn’t even learn how to look independently there.</p>
            <p>Who did they greatly honour? Paul Delaroche. I don’t have to tell you how Delaroche
                was one of the people who really didn’t stand up to scrutiny — there’s simply no one
                left who takes his part.</p>
            <p>Someone else who won’t stand up to scrutiny — even though he’s better — although he
                did make something very fine once or twice — who will also fail — that is —
                Gérôme.His Prisoner, though, his Syrian shepherd are felt, and I think them as fine
                as anybody, and readily and willingly.</p>
            <p>But by far the most often he’s a Delaroche II. Each of them, taking into account the
                context of their age, is of equal worth. What I’m now asserting is — that I consider
                it highly likely that the whole situation will bore you more by the year.</p>
            <p>What I further assert is that one does both others and especially oneself too a
                disservice by being bored. In spite of many wise lessons, I’ve never seriously
                granted that being bored ‘for one’s own good’ can have its good, practical side. Now
                a MASS of people have reformed themselves at the age of about 30 and changed very
                considerably.</p>
            <p>Just think calmly about this — I tell you that nothing of what I learnt and heard
                about art at G(and)Cie stood up to scrutiny. How if one reverses the generalities
                that count there as the conversation killers in judging art — namely praising the
                old or presentday Delaroche to the skies and discrediting the unorthodox — if, I
                say, one reverses certain maxims, then — one takes a breath of fresh air. In short —
                old chap — such curious turns in situations and affairs are possible — not only that
                — but even the rule. It’s funny, isn’t it — that, after all, I still doubt whether
                you’ll stay in the trade.</p>
            <p>You don’t have to take any notice of this or reply to it — I say it to you just to
                express my idea frankly, not to start futile exchanges of words.</p>
            <p>But it’s — an enchanted land — where one isn’t free.</p>
            <p>Anyway — I’ll hear sometime whether you’ve received the little crate and whether you
                find anything in it.</p>
            <p><work stage="planned" origin="new">Tomorrow I’m going to paint a thing in another
                    village — also a cottage — in a smaller size.</work>
                <unstress reason="environment">I found it last Sunday on a long trip I made in the
                    company of a peasant boy — in order to get hold of a wren’s nest. We found 6;

                    nests from which the young had already flown, so that one could take them
                    without too many pangs of conscience. It was so real; I also have some other

            <p>I’d like you to give both the paintings a varnish before you show them to Portier or
                Serret.</p>
            <p>The peasant cemetery has sunk in particularly badly, because it was very different on
                the canvas at first and I scraped the first thing off completely. It was a total
                failure at first — then I gave it short shrift and started from the beginning, went
                and sat on another side and painted early in the morning instead of in the evening.
                Well, and the other — the one of the cottage — was originally a shepherd. The sheep
                were shorn last week; I saw it — on a table in a barn.</p>
            <p>I’m glad that this time I can show Portier something very different again. <work
                    origin="new" stage="middle">I’m busy drawing, by the way, so as to send a few
                    fulllength figures in a little while.</work>
                <work stage="planned" origin="new">But working on the cottages — perhaps you’ll say
                    imitations of Michel, although they aren’t — and searching for subjects, I’ve
                    found such splendid cottages that I now really must go bird’s nesting with a
                    number of variations of these ‘people’s nests’, which remind me so much of the
                    nests of wrens — that’s to say, paint them.</work></p>
            <p>Oh — one mustn’t doubt — anyone who paints the peasants nowadays and has his heart in
                his work, he wins — at least a part, and not the worst although it’s not the largest
                — of the public.</p>
            <p>
                <stress reason="money">This doesn’t alter the fact that my end or second half of the
                    month — can still work out remarkably meagre. But the same happens to the
                    peasant lads too, and — they still have fun.</stress>
            </p>
            <p><good_health>I wish you’d been here on Sunday when we went on that trip. I came back
                    covered in mud because we had to spend a good half hour wading through a stream.
                    But for me painting is now becoming as stimulating and enticing as hunting — it
                    is a hunt, after all, for models, and beautiful places too.</good_health>
                Regards again, and best wishes to you. It’s already late and I have to be at the
                place at 5 o’clock, so — adieu. </p>

    </letter>
    <letter>
        <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
        <body>
            <p><unstress reason="money">Thanks for the money,</unstress> your letter and Raffaëlli
                catalogue. I think the drawings in it are masterly. What he himself also says about
                ‘character’ is interesting.</p>
            <p>His writing is a mixture of very simple words that come from the heart and from a
                nervous artistic emotion — they’re moving — and further — of words that I think
                Raffaëlli himself understands as little as one who has to read them. Thus it is
                writing full of very fine things and full of mistakes — I would rather read that
                than anything else. For what he’s talking about is mightily complicated.</p>
            <p>It seems to me, though, that the totality of what he says satisfies — when one has
                read it — and with all his strange outbursts he nonetheless says something sound and
                true.</p>
            <p>Theo, you mustn’t think that if I saw Uhde’s painting itself I would lose the
                impression I got of it. I say again that I believe this man will go the same way as
                Knaus and Lobrichon — namely that after a few things full of character, the very
                technique will play a dirty trick on him, that’s to say he’ll start working more and
                more correctly — and — more and more drily. I find Raffaëlli, say, a painter who
                stands much higher — than Uhde.</p>
            <p>You don’t hear me having any pessimistic doubts about Lhermitte, do you? So I’m not
                someone who always doubts. On the contrary, I have a very firm faith in some people.
                I had never seen anything by Raffaëlli besides those two blacksmiths when I wrote to
                you about it. Raffaëlli, and above all specifically Lhermitte, though, have what
                Raffaëlli’s talking about, ‘conscience’. I’m afraid that that’s where Uhde’s weak
                spot will be. That he’ll no longer know what he wants.</p>
            <p>Anyway. Now you say that Uhde’s silvery grey is so beautiful — and that if I saw the
                painting I’d think differently about it. No, old chap. I’ve already seen so almighty
                much grey that I’m not so easily seduced by a bit of silvery grey as I once was.
                Painting grey as a system is becoming intolerable, and we’ll get the other side of
                that coin! All the same, to convince you that I want to go on seeing the good in it
                and am not against it, <work origin="new" stage="middle">I have a grey thing going
                    right now.</work>We’ll — inevitably talk about these things again sometime.</p>
            <p>Don’t forget, though, that although I have certain reservations about Uhde, I said at
                the outset that I really do think this painting — as far as the main part is
                concerned, which is 3/4 of the painting — the children — very fine.</p>
            <p>I must get going — didn’t want to wait any longer; am dogtired every day because I’m
                so far away on the heath.</p>
            <p>I’ve got some more figures.</p>
            <p>I’m sorry about what you write about the money, that you’ll be short yourself.</p>
            <p>Painting is sometimes so damned expensive, and nowadays it just comes down to
                following one’s own idea at all costs.</p>
            <p>
                <stress reason="career">We need an art with strength and vigour, says Raffaëlli, and
                    in achieving this in the figure one has so much difficulty finding
                    models.</stress>
            </p>
            <p>The time has passed, and I’m not complaining about it. Although it’s enough for a
                figure to be put together conventionally, academically – or actually, although many
                people want precisely that, there’ll be a reaction nonetheless — and I hope that
                will stir things up. The artists are calling for character, well — the public will
                do the same. I assure you that I find Uhde’s Christ extraordinarily unfortunate, it
                won’t do — the children are good.</p>
            <p>I’m so fond of Lhermitte — Raffaëlli — because it’s thought out through and through,
                sensible and honest.</p>
            <p><work stage="finished" origin="new">I’ve got a few figures here, a woman with a spade
                    seen from behind</work>,<work stage="finished" origin="new"> another one bending
                    over to glean ears of corn</work> — <work stage="finished" origin="new">another
                    one from the front with her head almost on the ground, digging up
                    carrots.</work></p>
            <p>I’ve been spying on these peasant figures here for 1 1/2 years and on their
                activities, precisely to get some character into it. So I really can’t stand a Santa
                Claus like Uhde put there in that little school — the little school itself is so
                fine, though! Uhde himself — well, I wager that he knows it too — and that he did it
                on account of the fact that the good citizens of that country where he lives desire
                a ‘subject’ and ‘something conventional to think about’, and otherwise he’d have to
                starve. <stress reason="career">If I find another moment one of these days when I’m
                    not too tired to write,</stress> I’ll try to tell you how outstandingly good I
                find some things in Raffaëlli. Regards, with a handshake.</p>

    <letter>
        <salutation>Dear brother,</salutation>
        <body>
            <p>Thanks for your letter and the money.</p>
            <p>Assuming that what you say is true, that <stress reason="family">you started to write
                    to me repeatedly but didn’t get round to finishing the letter before — I’m in
                    the same position, since I’ve already thrown what I wrote to you into the stove
                    twice — because I found it either too bitter or too tame. What shall I say to
                    you?</stress> — your letter sounds very correct to me, and has a tone like that
                of a good Minister for Fine Arts, say.</p>
            <p>But — that doesn’t alter the fact that it isn’t much good to me and it doesn’t
                satisfy me — and above all your ‘perhaps later, once you have expressed yourself
                more clearly, we’ll perhaps also find something in your present work — and then not
                act as we do now’.... fine promise — but — a ministerial fata Morgana — in the eyes
                of someone like me, who would rather find an outlet at a lower level provided it was
                in the present.</p>
            <p>There you have it — that outlet in the present, with 3rdrate dealers if necessary
                (not from choice) — is something I can’t ask of you in your position — so be it —
                but you can’t ask me to acquiesce in a ministerial fata Morgana, I’m too practical
                for that, after all. Please appreciate that I call you a good minister — and know
                only too well how damned bad the people above the ground floor are as a rule, so I’m
                very willing to treasure a few bright spots, even in the ministerial sphere. <stress
                    reason="career">Which isn’t intransigent, and it’s for that reason that I
                    herewith certainly piss on the sacred shrine of the intransigents — as I often
                    do — on sacred shrines in general.</stress></p>
            <p>
                <stress reason="money">To business, though — have you ever realized that I presently
                    have more than two guilders in expenses daily — reckon 1 for the model, 1 for
                    canvas, paint — it can’t come out any cheaper.</stress>
            </p>
            <p>
                <stress reason="money">I still have bills to pay — and — I must go to Antwerp. My
                    position here is rather too strained, I’m not comfortable at the moment and I
                    have enough trouble sticking it out and ‘possessing my soul in patience’, as
                    they say.</stress>
            </p>
            <p>At home, after all — although there are no real rows — they don’t find the prospect
                of my staying here too long a pleasant one. Which I can well understand. And yet I
                can’t leave — either altogether — or partly (partly if I keep my studio on, which is
                my plan) unless I make a whole lot more studies and — find something new to settle
                me in Antwerp. Will you please bear this in mind? And if you’d do your best to make
                it rather easier for me financially, I believe that then there would be a real
                chance of keeping the peace later, albeit it far from concord. Which I wish for
                myself and also for others, that calmness.</p>
            <p>What is not can yet come, you say, regarding my work — and I, regarding the
                perception of something other than a fata Morgana in your saying ‘later we’ll etc. —
                (see above)’: Today — it’s a fata Morgana to me and I wish, in any event, to try
                Antwerp. Regards, with a handshake.</p>

        <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
        <body>
            <p> Today Uncle Jan found some clothes that were Hendrik’s which he’s grown out of, and
                asked if I could use them, and I said if I might share them with you I’d gladly take
                them. So herewith a pair of duffle trousers which may well be of use to you in the
                autumn and winter, by which time you’ll likely be in need of them. I have a black
                pair. </p>
            <p> Today was stormy, on my way to my lessons this morning I looked towards the
                Zuiderzee from the bridge. There was one white stripe on the horizon with dark grey
                clouds above it, the rain pouring down from them in slanting lines in the distance,
                standing out against this was the long row of houses with the Oosterkerk. </p>
            <p> Uncle Jan went to Leiden yesterday, so I was alone that day. In the morning I went
                to the Oosterkerk and heard a sermon on Isaiah 55:8 and 9, ‘For My thoughts are not
                your thoughts, neither are your ways My ways, saith the Lord. For as the Heavens are
                higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than your ways, and My thoughts higher
                than your thoughts’. </p>
            <p> Walked to the seaside in the afternoon, and spent the rest of the day writing.
                    <stress reason="career">The work and writing don’t yet go as fast and easily as
                    I’d wish,</stress> but I hope to learn by practice, but, old boy, if I could I’d
                like to skip over a few years, <unstress reason="love">though I trust that I shall
                    succeed and that my lips shall speak the fullness of preaching the gospel and
                    that my hand shall write it, and I pray that that be given me, but first one
                    must get some rest when one already has several years of work behind one and
                    feels one is on the way and is doing the same thing as those whom one
                    loves.</unstress>
            </p>
            <p> This morning I was in Uncle Stricker’s study, it’s beautiful and he has a portrait
                of Calvin after Ary Scheffer hanging there, although I should have liked very much
                to see more prints on the wall. Last week I got as far as Gen. XXIII, the burial of
                Sarah in the field that Abraham bought to bury her there in the cave of Machpelah,
                and <work origin="new" stage="sketch">I couldn’t help making a little drawing of how
                    I imagined that place to be, it’s nothing very special but I’m enclosing it
                    anyway.</work>
            </p>
            <p> A good letter from home yesterday, wrote back today, also to Anna. You must also
                write again soon, for I’m longing to hear from you. </p>
            <p> Right now all the people are leaving the dockyard to go home, that’s nice to see.
                One hears them already early in the morning, I think there are around 3,000 of them,
                the sound of their footsteps is something like the sound of the sea. This morning
                bought from a Jew ‘Tobias’ after Rembrandt, a small engraving, for six cents. </p>
            <p> Uncle Jan sends you many regards, write him a word or two, or else write a sentence
                in a letter to me that I can read to him to thank him for the clothes. </p>
            <p> How is Mrs Tersteeg doing? I’m also eager to hear whether you’ve been to see Mauve. </p>
            <p> Aunt Mina and Paul’s girl will soon be going to Etten, that will be nice for them at
                home. Pa wrote that the church had been whitewashed and the organ painted. Yesterday
                3 children were baptized. Lips is still no better, and Willem van Eekelen’s wife is
                also very ill. Did you hear that Uncle Vincent has bronchitis again, and it seems to
                be serious? It’s fortunate that Uncle is back in the country, and in his own house,
                and that Pa and Ma visit him almost every day. </p>
            <p>Now, old boy, I wish you the very best, give my regards to your housemates, please
                forgive me for not being able to pay the postage on the parcel, old chap, do write
                soon and accept in thought a hearty handshake, and believe me</p>

            <p><bad_health>I’m picking up this letter again to try and write, it will come little by
                    little, it’s just that my mind has been so affected – without pain, it’s true –
                    but totally stupefied. </bad_health>I must tell you that there are – as far as I
                can judge – others who have this like me; who having worked during a period of their
                life are reduced to powerlessness even so. One doesn’t easily learn anything good
                between four walls, that’s understandable, but nevertheless it’s true that there are
                also people who can no longer be left at liberty as if they had nothing wrong with
                them. And so I almost or entirely despair of myself. Perhaps, perhaps I would indeed
                get better in the country for a time.</p>
            <p><work origin="new" stage="middle">Work was going well, the last canvas of the
                    branches in blossom, you’ll see that it was perhaps the most patiently worked,
                    best thing I had done, painted with calm and a greater sureness of touch.
                </work>And the next day done for like a brute. Difficult to understand things like
                that, but alas, that’s how it is. I have a great desire to get back to my work,
                though, but Gauguin also writes that he, who is nevertheless robust, also despairs
                of being able to continue. And isn’t it true that we often see the story of artists
                like that. So, my poor brother, take things as they are, don’t grieve on my account,
                it will encourage me and support me more than you think to know that you’re running
                your household well. Then, after a time of trial, perhaps days of serenity will
                return for me too. But in the meantime I’ll send you some canvases soon. Russell
                also wrote to me, and I think it’s good to have written to him so that he doesn’t
                forget us completely – for your part speak of him from time to time so that people
                may know that although he works in isolation he’s a very good man, and I think he’ll
                do good things as one used to see in England, for example. He’s right a thousand
                times over to barricade himself in a little.</p>
            <p>Give my regards to the Pissarros, later I’m going to read your letters more calmly,
                and hope to write again tomorrow or the day after.</p>

            <p>I felt as you did, in so far as when you write that the work didn’t yet proceed as
                usual the very first few days, I had the same experience.</p>
            <p>They have therefore been days that none of us will forget, and yet the overall
                impression isn’t terrible but only grave. Life isn’t long for anyone, and the
                question is just — to do something with it.</p>
            <p>
                <work origin="new" stage="middle">The painting went better again today; the first
                    two heads went wrong — today’s is a head of a young girl, almost a child’s
                    head.</work>
            </p>
            <p><work stage="finished" origin="existing">As to colour, it’s a contrast of bright red
                    and pale green against the colour of the little face; there’s already a head
                    like it among those you took with you.</work> I’d like to hear sometime whether
                those rolledup ones arrived safely.</p>
            <p><work origin="new" stage="finished">If I thought that C.M. meant it when he asked for
                    heads of children, I could send him this one I did today</work>, but..... I
                can’t say I feel much inclined to enter into correspondence (unless he asks for
                something more specifically).</p>
            <p>It can do no harm, though, that he’s been to the studio.<work stage="planned"
                    origin="new"> I don’t mind starting a new still life of those honesty heads and
                    dry leaves against blue either, because he said something about that
                too.</work></p>
            <p><stress reason="money">Of course I intend to keep working hard, but it’s very
                    necessary for me to square my paint bill as soon as possible. </stress>Every
                other year, I’ve been able to get square at about this time and buy myself some new
                equipment. <stress reason="money">And this year I’ve painted so much the last few
                    months that I actually need it more.</stress></p>
            <p>I didn’t want to keep talking about it or contradict you much when you were here —
                but when you said that I would change some day and, no more than Mauve stayed in
                Bloemendaal for ever, would I stay here for ever either — maybe — but — I don’t see
                any advantage myself in moving, because I have a good studio here and the
                countryside here is very beautiful.Don’t forget that I’m definitely convinced that a
                painter of peasant life can do no better than follow the example of Barbizon –
                dwelling and living right in the midst of what one is painting, for it’s new and
                different outside every day.</p>
            <p>In short, the two reasons for living in the country are that one can do more work and
                has fewer expenses.</p>
            <p>There are about 3 months, let’s say, between now and the time you come back here in
                the summer.</p>
            <p><work origin="new" stage="planned">If I work hard day after day, I can have another
                    20 or so studies for you by then, and moreover another twenty or so to take to
                    Antwerp if you want.</work>
                <stress reason="money">But — it’s very necessary for me to pay off my paint bill as
                    soon as possible.</stress> You know I didn’t say another word to you about it
                either in February or in March.</p>
            <p>But I didn’t have it easy in those months, I can tell you that.</p>
            <p>It has become colder again here. <work stage="planned" origin="new">As soon as we
                    have a few fine days, I’ll make something of the churchyard.</work>
                <work origin="new" stage="middle">I think the little head I made today is certainly
                    as good as the one you have with a large white cap, which is something like
                    thisAfter ‘this’ (dit) Van Gogh drew a little arrow pointing to the sketches And
                    could serve as a pendant to it.</work></p>

                    might perhaps look good in the gold, do better than by themselves.</work>

        <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
        <body>
            <p>
                <work origin="new" stage="middle">I’m very busy working on the series of heads of
                    the people that I’ve resolved to make.</work>
            </p>
            <p>I enclose herewith another scratch of the last one — I usually just scribble them
                from memory on a scrap of paper in the evening, hence this one.</p>
            <p><work stage="planned" origin="new">I may perhaps do them in watercolour too, later
                    on. </work>But paint them first.</p>
            <p>Now listen — do you remember that right at the very beginning I always spoke to you
                of my great respect and sympathy for the work of père Degroux? I think about him
                more than ever these days. One mustn’t look at his few history pieces — although
                they’re fine, too — nor in the first place at a few paintings that are in the
                sentiment of the writer Conscience, for instance. But one must see his Saying grace,
                The pilgrimage, The paupers’ pew and, above all, above all, the simple Brabant
                types. Degroux is as little appreciated as Thijs Maris, for instance. He’s
                different, however — but — they have this in common, that they met with fierce
                opposition.</p>
            <p>Now — in this age — whether the public is wiser — I don’t know — but I do know this —
                that it’s absolutely not superfluous to be serious in what one wants and what one
                does.</p>
            <p>And at this moment I could name you several new names of people who are hammering
                again on the same old anvil on which Degroux hammered.</p>
            <p>If Degroux — at that time — had chosen to dress his Brabant characters in medieval
                costumes, he would have run parallel to Leys, not just as regards genius but perhaps
                also — fortune. However, he didn’t do that and now — years later — people have
                noticeably changed their minds about the medieval — although Leys will always be
                Leys and Thijs Maris, Thijs Maris — and Victor Hugo’s NotreDame — NotreDame. But —
                realism — not wanted then — is now — demanded — and — there’s more need of it than
                ever. For that realism that has character and a sincere sentiment. <work
                    origin="new" stage="planned">I want to tell you this, that as for me, I’ll try
                    to steer a straight course — and will paint — the dead simple, most everyday
                    things.</work></p>
            <p>
                <unstress reason="money">How, for God’s sake, is it possible that you don’t seem to
                    be able or willing to understand that, by setting up my studio here and keeping
                    it on for the time being, I’ve made it possible for me to have enough money for
                    painting — and that if I had acted differently, no good would have come of it
                    either for me or for others?</unstress>
            </p>
            <p>Had I not done that, I would have had to muddle along for perhaps another 3 years
                before I had finally swallowed the bitter pill of colour and tone, also simply
                because of the expense.</p>
            <p><stress reason="family">It’s now just a year since I arrived here, driven by
                    necessity. I’m certainly not at home for my pleasure — but for my painting —
                    and, this being so, I think it very wrong of you that you should deprive me of
                    an opportunity if I were to leave here now — before ever I have something
                    new.</stress> I have to be here for a time for my painting — then — as soon as
                I’ve conquered that more definitely, I’ll be happy to go anywhere I can earn the
                same as I now have here.</p>
            <p>But I don’t need or deserve to go backwards — nor do I have the slightest desire to —
                you see? <stress reason="money">And to seek to be rid of you — I’ve never done that,
                    but where you have only too plainly let me see how little chance there was that
                    we’d actually do business together — I accept it for the future, that’s true.
                    Know this once and for all, when I ask you for money, I don’t ask it for
                    nothing</stress> — you can have the work I make with it in return, and if I’m in
                arrears with it now — I’m on the right road even to get ahead of it.</p>
            <p>
                <stress reason="money">I write this yet again for the same reason as the previous
                    letters — I’m stuck at the end of the month because I only have enough left to
                    pay my model for 2 or 3 days. And I’m wretched because I’ll be stuck again for
                    10 days, or 12, this month.</stress>
            </p>
            <p><stress reason="money">And in the utmost seriousness, once again — can’t you find
                    some way of helping me with 20 francs, say, to cover that little end? It’s my
                    time that will otherwise not be sufficiently occupied that really pains
                    me.</stress> Regards.</p>

        <body>
            <p>My hearty congratulations on this day, many happy returns, have a good day tomorrow,
                and many good days in the year you’re now beginning. Time passes quickly and the
                days fly past – yet something can remain and the past isn’t entirely lost –
                    <good_health>we can become richer and firmer of spirit, of character, of heart,
                    we can become richer in God, we can become richer in the fine gold of life, the
                    love for one another and the feeling ‘and yet I am not alone, because the Father
                    is with me’.</good_health> May it be so for all of us, it is a good prayer, that
                one of Father’s: O Lord, join us intimately to one another and let our love for Thee
                make that bond ever stronger.</p>
            <p>I hope to see you soon, because when I go to Amsterdam I’m planning to stop in The
                Hague for a while. Don’t tell anyone about this, though, because my main purpose in
                doing so is to see you. </p>
            <p> I’m going to Etten this Wednesday, to stay there for a few days before putting my
                hand to the plough. </p>
            <p> I should have liked you to be here yesterday; in the morning I heard the Rev.
                Hooyer’s farewell sermon in the little French church. The church was full, he spoke
                with fire and feeling, <unstress reason="environment">I was moved by the sight of
                    that distinguished, singular congregation, the mood was very earnest.</unstress>
                He thanked them for the love that he had received from many of them, especially at
                difficult times, in the beginning, four years ago, when he was wrestling with the
                difficulties of speaking in French, because he’s a Dutchman. There were various
                other clergymen in the congregation. </p>
            <p> In the afternoon I went to the Grote Kerk to hear the Rev. Keller van Hoorn, whose
                text was ‘Our Father’; in the evening I heard the Rev. Greeff, whom I’d heard on my
                first Sunday evening here in Dordrecht. By chance, he took for his sermon yesterday
                the same text he had taken that first time: Now we see through a glass, darkly; now
                I know in part, but then shall I know even as also I am known. </p>
            <p> After church I walked along that path behind the station where we walked together,
                thinking of you and wishing we could be together – and kept on walking until I came
                to the cemetery at the end of a black cinder road running through the meadows that
                looked so beautiful in the twilight. <unstress reason="environment">The cemetery
                    looks a little like that drawing by Apol in ‘Eigen Haard’, there’s a canal
                    around it and there’s a house surrounded by pine trees, yesterday evening the
                    light was shining through the windows in such a friendly way – it’s an old house
                    that looks like a parsonage.</unstress> There can still be much good in store
                for both of us, let us learn to say after Pa ‘I never despair’ and after Uncle Jan
                ‘the devil is never so black that one cannot look him in the face’. </p>
            <p> Write again soon, this Wednesday, then, I’ll be in Etten. Do you have De Plancy,
                Légendes des artistes, with woodcuts after Rochussen? I hope to bring it for you. </p>
            <p> These last few days I’ve managed, in between times, to work my way through the whole
                story of Christ from a catechism book written by Uncle Stricker, and I copied out
                the texts, which brought to mind so many paintings by Rembrandt and others. It is, I
                believe and trust, a choice not to be repented of, which I’ve made in an attempt to
                become a Christian and a Christian labourer. Yes, all things of the past can work
                together for good, familiarity with cities like London and Paris and life in such
                places as that school in Ramsgate and in Isleworth makes one more drawn and attached
                to many things and such books of the Bible as The Acts of the Apostles. Knowing and
                loving the work and life of such men as Jules Breton, Millet and Jacque, Rembrandt,
                Bosboom and so many others, can also be a source of ideas. What a similarity there
                is between the work and life of Pa and that of such men; that of Pa I rate even
                higher. </p>
            <p> God help us, old boy, He can make you and all of us and me say, Lord, it is enough. </p>
            <p>Adieu, accept a handshake in thought and again, hearty congratulations from</p>

        <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
        <body>
            <p>I wanted to add to my letter of the day before yesterday that I had a letter from
                Rappard yesterday, and our quarrel is wholly made up, that he sent me a croquis of a
                large painting of a brickworks that he’s working on. This looks very original — if
                one wanted to find other paintings in the same spirit, it would be Meunier, say,
                whose mineworkers you saw in Antwerp. He’s rented a small house outside Utrecht,
                just as a studio (and arranged for light from above) near the brickworks, and since
                he’s also going back to Terschelling he’s deep in nature again, and to my mind
                that’s better than working in town.</p>
            <p><stress reason="family">I wanted to tell you, though, that I hope that the quarrel
                    that we have will end like this, too, and that it will be settled.</stress> No
                more than I can accept his criticism, can I fully resign myself to the present
                situation in which my work is held up so badly by my financial difficulties. I don’t
                ask you to put this right alone, but I simply want us to do our best together (and
                not just I alone either) to make headway. It’s an effort for you, too, and not easy;
                I know that, and as such I appreciate it very much, but making an effort for a goal
                is no misfortune, and having to fight is the precondition for every honest
                victory.</p>
            <p>
                <stress reason="money">The expenses of painting can’t always be avoided, and not
                    incurring them is sometimes not the best policy, because nothing decent could
                    come of it if one hesitated to pay for models or essential painting materials.
                    And since it’s getting harder for me rather than better, it has eventually got
                    to such a pitch that I definitely have to complain.And I say once more, let’s
                    keep my little painting business in order, because sooner or later we might be
                    in sore need of it.</stress>

            <p>When there’s a storm in the air, one has to keep the boats in good shape. The man I
                now have in The Hague is Leurs, who doesn’t live in Praktizijnshoek any more but in
                Molenstraat.</p>
            <p>He’s asking me to send him more than one painting in order to have more than one
                chance, and is offering me his two windows.</p>
            <p>And since he’s very hard pressed for money himself, he won’t shrink from making an
                effort. <work stage="finished" origin="new">I’m sending him a couple of cottages,
                    the old tower and smaller ones of figures.</work>
                <work origin="new" stage="planned">And while he shows those, I’ll make a few new
                    ones to keep him going.</work></p>
            <p>I’ve also got a chance of persuading a second in The Hague.</p>
            <p>But for me it comes down to being able to go on working.</p>
            <p>
                <work origin="new" stage="finished">I’ve made another small painting of the wheat
                    harvest since you left, the same size as the women pulling turnips in the snow:
                    a reaper, a woman binding sheaves, sheaves, and the windmill, like the drawings
                    you saw. An effect in the evening after sunset.</work>

                in quite a fix, encourage them to do what they can, that for my part I’ll see about
                sending them new things.</p>

        <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
        <body>
            <p>I wish that the 4 canvases I wrote to you about were gone. I may work on them again
                if I keep them here too long, and I think it’s better for you to get them as they
                come from the heath.</p>
            <p>The reason why I don’t send them off is that<stress reason="money"> I don’t want to
                    send them to you with the carriage unpaid at a moment when you say that you
                    might be short yourself, and I can’t pay the carriage myself
                either.</stress></p>
            <p>I’ve never seen the little house where Millet lived — but I imagine that these 4
                little human nests are of the same kind.</p>
            <p><work stage="finished" origin="existing">One of them is the residence of a gentleman
                    who’s popularly known here as ‘the peasant of Rauwveld’ </work>—<work
                    stage="finished" origin="existing"> the other is occupied by a worthy soul who,
                    when I went there, was engaged in nothing more mysterious than turning over her
                    potato patch, but must also be able to work magic, though — at any rate she goes
                    by the name of ‘the witch’s head’. </work>You remember that it says in the book
                by Gigoux how it came about that Delacroix had 17 paintings rejected at the same
                time. This shows — at least so it seems to me — that he and others from that period
                — were faced with connoisseurs and nonconnoisseurs, none of whom either understood
                it or wanted to buy — this shows that those who are rightly described in the book as
                ‘the valiant ones’ didn’t talk about fighting a losing battle, but carried on
                painting.</p>
            <p>Something else I wanted to say to you is that we’ll have to paint a lot more if we
                take that about Delacroix as our startingpoint. <stress reason="money">I must
                    necessarily be the most disagreeable of all people, that’s to say having to ask
                    for money.</stress>
                <stress reason="money">And since I don’t think that things will take a turn for the
                    better as regards sales in the next few days, this is bad enough.</stress> But I
                ask you, isn’t it better, after all, for both of us to work hard even though there
                are difficulties attached to it, than to sit about philosophizing at a time like
                this?</p>
            <p>I don’t know the future, Theo — but — I do know the eternal law that everything
                changes — think back 10 years and things were different, the conditions, the mood of
                the people, everything in short. And 10 years on, a great deal is bound to have
                changed again. But doing something endures — and one doesn’t easily regret having
                done something. The more active the better, and I’d rather fail than sit idle.
                Whether Portier is or isn’t the man to do something with my work — we need him now
                all the same. And here’s what I think – after working for a year, say, we’ll have
                got more together than now, and I know for sure that my work will do better as I
                complete one thing with another. The people who have some feeling for it now, who,
                like him, talk about showing it sometime — they’re consequently useful, because
                after another year’s work, say, they’ll have a few more things together that will
                speak for themselves, even if they say nothing at all. Should you happen to see
                Portier, feel free to tell him that, far from giving up, I’m planning to send him
                much more. You must also go on showing when you meet people. It won’t be so very
                long before what we can show will be more important. Y<good_health>ou can see for
                    yourself — and it’s a phenomenon that gives me surprisingly great pleasure —
                    that people are increasingly starting to stage exhibitions of 1 person or a very
                    few who belong together.</good_health> This is a phenomenon in the art trade
                which I dare think has more future than other enterprises. It’s good that people are
                beginning to understand that a Bouguereau can’t do well beside a Jacque — nor a
                figure by Beyle or Lhermitte beside a Schelfhout or Koekkoek. </p>
            <p>Scatter Raffaëlli’s drawings about — and judge for yourself whether it would be
                possible to form a good idea of this singular artist. He — Raffaëlli — isn’t like
                Régamey — but I find him just as much of a personality. If my work stayed with me —
                I think I’d be constantly working over it. By sending it to you and to Portier as it
                comes from the countryside or from the cottages, the odd thing that isn’t right will
                sometimes get through — but things that wouldn’t be improved by frequently working
                over them will be preserved.</p>
            <p><work origin="existing" stage="finished">If you had these 4 canvases and a few more,
                    smaller studies of cottages,</work> and someone saw nothing by me other than
                those, they’d be bound to think that I did nothing other than paint cottages. <work
                    stage="finished" origin="existing">And likewise with that series of
                    heads.</work> But peasant life involves such diverse things that when Millet
                speaks of ‘working like a bunch of negroes’, this really does have to happen if one
                wants to achieve a whole. One may laugh at Courbet’s saying, ‘painting angels! who
                has ever seen angels!’ But I’d just like to add, for instance, ‘justices in the
                harem, who has ever seen justices in the Harem?’ (the painting by BenjaminConstant).
                ‘Bull fights, who has ever seen those?’ and so many other Moorish, Spanish things,
                Cardinals, and then all those history paintings, which are still always there,
                metres high by metres wide! What’s the point of it all, and what do people want with
                it? After a few years most of it becomes stale and dull, and more and more
                boring.But still. Perhaps they’re well painted — maybe. Nowadays, when connoisseurs
                stand in front of a painting like the one by BenjaminConstant, or like a reception
                at a cardinal’s by some Spaniard or other — it’s the custom to say, with a knowing
                air, something about ‘clever technique’. But — as soon as those same connoisseurs
                found themselves in front of a scene from peasant life or a drawing by Raffaëlli,
                say, they would criticize the technique with the same air — à la C.M.</p>
            <p>Perhaps you think that I’m wrong to comment on this — but — I’m so gripped by the
                thought that all these exotic paintings are painted in THE STUDIO. But just go and
                sit outdoors, painting on the spot itself! Then all sorts of things like the
                following happen — I must have picked a good hundred flies and more off the 4
                canvases that you’ll be getting, not to mention dust and sand (and);c. — not to
                mention that, when one carries them across the heath and through hedgerows for a few
                hours, the odd branch or two scrapes across them . Not to mention that when one
                arrives on the heath after a couple of hours’ walk in this weather, one is tired and
                hot. Not to mention that the figures don’t stand still like professional models, and
                the effects that one wants to capture change as the day wears on.I don’t know how it
                is with you — but for my part, the more I work on it the more peasant life absorbs
                    me.<unstress reason="career"> And the less and less I care about either the
                    Cabanelesque things, among which I would also count Jacquet, also
                    BenjaminConstant’s present work — or the highly praised but so unspeakably,
                    hopelessly dry technique of the Italians and Spaniards.</unstress> Image makers!
                — what Jacque said, I often think about it. But I’m not biased; I like Raffaëlli
                who, after all, paints something very different from peasants — I like Alfred
                Stevens, Tissot, to mention something that’s entirely unlike peasants — I like a
                fine portrait. Zola who otherwise, to my mind, often makes colossal mistakes in his
                judgement of paintings — says something beautiful about art in general in ‘Mes
                haines’. ‘In the painting (the work of art) I look for, I love the man — the
                artist.’</p>
            <p>There you are, I think that’s perfectly true — I ask you, what sort of a man, what
                sort of a visionary/observer or thinker, what sort of a human character is there
                behind some of these canvases praised for their technique — often, after all,
                nothing. But a Raffaëlli — is someone, a Lhermitte is someone, and in many paintings
                by virtually unknown people one feels that they were made with a will, with emotion,
                with passion, with love. The TECHNIQUE of a painting from peasant life or — like
                Raffaëlli — from the heart of urban workers — entails difficulties quite different
                from those of the slick painting and the rendering of action of a Jacquet or
                BenjaminConstant. That’s to say, living in those cottages day in and day out, being
                out in the fields just like the peasants — enduring the heat of the sun in the
                summer, the snow and frost in the winter, not indoors but outside, and not for a
                walk, but day in and day out like the peasants themselves.</p>
            <p>And I ask you, when you think about it, am I so wrong to criticize the criticism of
                the connoisseurs, who are presently fencing more busily than ever with the often so
                meaningless word technique (they’re increasingly giving it a conventional
                meaning)?</p>
            <p>When one counts all the trudging and lugging one has to do to paint ‘the peasant of
                Rauwveld’ and his cottage, I dare swear that this is a longer and more tiring
                expedition than many painters of exotic subjects, be it the justice in the harem or
                the reception at the cardinal’s, make for their choicest eccentric subjects. For in
                Paris one can get Arab or Spanish or Moorish models simply by ordering and paying
                for them. But it’s harder for someone like Raffaëlli, who paints the ragpickers of
                Paris in their own small quarter, and his work is more serious.</p>
            <p>Seemingly there’s nothing simpler than painting peasants or ragpickers and other
                labourers but — no subjects in painting are as difficult as those everyday
                figures!There isn’t — as far as I know — a single academy where one learns to draw
                and paint a digger, a sower, a woman hanging a pot over the fire, or a seamstress.
                But in every town of any consequence at all there’s an academy with a choice of
                models for historical, Arab, Louis XV and, in a word, all figures, provided they
                don’t exist in reality.</p>
            <p><work origin="new" stage="planned">If I send you and Serret a few studies of diggers
                    or peasant women who are weeding, gleaning corn (and);c. as the start of a whole
                    series about all kinds of work in the fields — then it may be that either Serret
                    or you will discover faults in them which will be useful for me to know about,
                    and which I’ll naturally concede myself.</work> But I want to point out
                something that’s perhaps worth noting. All academic figures are constructed in the
                same way and, let’s admit, one couldn’t do better. Impeccable — without faults —
                you’ll already have seen what I’m driving at — also without giving us anything new
                to discover. Not so the figures of a Millet, a Lhermitte, a Régamey, a Lhermitte, a
                Daumier. They’re also well constructed — but not the way the academy teaches, after
                all. I think that no matter how academically correct a figure may be, it’s REDUNDANT
                in this day and age, even if it were by Ingres himself (apart from his Source of
                course, because that indeed was and is and will remain something new) if it lacks
                that essential modernism — the intimate character, the actual DOING SOMETHING.</p>
            <p>When will the figure not be redundant then, even though there were necessarily faults
                and grave faults in it to my mind, you’ll probably ask.</p>
            <p>When the digger digs, when the peasant is a peasant, and the peasant woman a peasant
                woman. Is this something new? Yes. Even the little figures by Ostade, Ter Borch
                don’t work the way they do nowadays.I’d like to say a lot more about this and I’d
                like to say how much I myself want to do what I’ve begun even better — and how much
                higher than my own I value the work of some others. I ask you — do you know of a
                single digger, a single sower in the old Dutch school??? Did they ever try to make
                ‘a labourer’? Did Velázquez try it in his watercarrier? Or his folk types? No. Work,
                that’s what the figures in the old paintings don’t do. <work stage="middle"
                    origin="new">These days I’m slogging away at a woman whom I saw last winter,
                    lifting carrots in the snow.</work> There it is — Millet did it, Lhermitte, and
                in general the peasant painters of this century — an Israëls — they find that more
                beautiful than anything else. But even in this century, how relatively few there are
                among the legion of painters who want the figure — yes — above all — for the sake of
                the figure (i.e. for the sake of form and modelling) but can’t conceive of it other
                than working, and also have the need — which the old masters avoided, as did the old
                Dutch masters who depicted so many conventional actions — and — I say — have the
                need to paint the action for the action’s sake.</p>
            <p>So that the painting or the drawing is a figure drawing for the sake of the figure
                and the inexpressibly harmonic form of the human body — yet at the same time — is
                lifting carrots in the snow. Am I expressing myself clearly? I hope so, and just say
                this to Serret — I can say it in fewer words — a nude figure by Cabanel, a lady by
                Jacquet and a peasant woman not by BastienLepage himself, but a peasant woman by a
                Parisian who learnt to draw at the academy, will always show the limbs and the
                structure of the body in the same way — sometimes charmingly — correct — in
                proportion and anatomy. But when Israëls or when Daumier or Lhermitte, say, draw a
                figure, one will feel the form of the body much more and yet — this is why I
                particularly want to include Daumier — the proportions will sometimes be almost
                random, the anatomy and structure often completely wrong ‘in the eyes of the
                academicians’.</p>
            <p>But it will live. And above all Delacroix, too.</p>
            <p>It still isn’t expressed properly. Tell Serret that I would be desperate if my
                figures were good, tell him that I don’t want them academically correct. Tell him
                that I mean that if one photographs a digger, then he would certainly not be
                digging. Tell him that I think Michelangelo’s figures magnificent, even though the
                legs are definitely too long — the hips and buttocks too broad. Tell him that in my
                view Millet and Lhermitte are consequently the true painters, because they don’t
                paint things as they are, examined drily and analytically, but as they, Millet,
                Lhermitte, Michelangelo, feel them. Tell him that my great desire is to learn to
                make such inaccuracies, such variations, reworkings, alterations of the reality,
                that it might become, very well — lies if you will — but — truer than the literal
                truth.</p>
            <p>And now I must close soon — I did need, though, just to talk about the fact that
                those who paint the life of the peasants or the common people, although they aren’t
                counted among the men of the world — will still, however, perhaps endure better in
                the long run than the makers of the exotic but painted in Paris harems and
                cardinals’ receptions.</p>
            <p>
                <stress reason="money">I know that it’s being a disagreeable person when one’s in
                    need of money at inconvenient times — but my excuse is just that painting the
                    seemingly most everyday things is sometimes the most difficult and most
                    expensive.The expenses that I must incur if I want to work are sometimes very
                    heavy in relation to my means. I assure you that if my constitution weren’t
                    becoming virtually like that of a peasant as a result of wind and weather, I
                    wouldn’t stick it out, for there’s simply nothing left over for my own comfort.
                    But I don’t desire that for myself either, any more than many peasants desire to
                    live other than as they live. But what I do ask is both for paint and, above
                    all, for models. You’ll perhaps realize from what I say about the figure
                    drawings that I’m positively passionate about going on with them.</stress>
            </p>
            <p>You recently wrote to me that Serret had spoken to you ‘with conviction’ about
                certain faults in the structure of the figures of the potato eaters. But you’ll have
                been able to see from my answer that my own criticism also condemns them, considered
                from that point of view, only I’ve pointed out how this was an impression I had
                after I’d seen the cottage in the dim lamplight on many evenings, after having
                painted 40 heads, from which it follows that I was starting from a different point
                of view. Now we’ve started talking about the figure, though, I have a great deal to
                say. I find in Raffaëlli’s words, his perception about ‘Character’, what he says
                about that is good — and in its place — and clarified by the drawings
                themselves.</p>
            <p>People who move in artistic and literary circles, though, as Raffaëlli does in Paris,
                think differently after all from, say, the way I do out in the country among the
                peasants. I mean they search for one word that sums up all their ideas — he suggests
                the word ‘Character’ for the figures of the future. I agree with it, with the
                intention — I believe — but I believe as little in the accuracy of the word as in
                the accuracy of other words — as little as in the accuracy or appositeness of my own
                expressions.Rather than saying there has to be character in a digger — I describe it
                by saying this peasant has to be a peasant, this digger has to dig, and then there’s
                something in it that is essentially modern. But I feel that people can draw
                conclusions I don’t mean even from these words — even were I to add a whole
                list.</p>
            <p><stress reason="money">Instead of reducing the expenses for models — which are
                    already quite a burden on me — I think it would be desirable — very desirable —
                    if I could increase them a little.</stress> Because I’m concerned with something
                very different from being able to do ‘a little figure’ drawing. Showing the figure
                of the peasant in action, you see that’s what a figure is — I repeat — essentially
                modern — the heart of modern art itself — that which neither the Greeks, nor the
                Renaissance, nor the old Dutch school have done.</p>
            <p>To me, this is a matter I think about every day. However, this difference between
                both the great and the lesser masters of the present (the great, for instance
                Millet, Lhermitte, Breton, Herkomer; the lesser, for instance Raffaëlli and Régamey)
                and the old schools isn’t something I’ve often found expressed truly forthrightly in
                articles on art.</p>
            <p>Just think about whether you don’t find it’s true, though. The figure of the peasant
                and the workman started more as a ‘genre’ — but nowadays, with Millet in the van as
                the eternal master, it’s the very heart of modern art and will remain so.</p>
            <p>People like Daumier — one has to respect them because they’re among the pioneers. The
                simple nude but modern figure ranks high — as revived by Henner and Lefebvre, Baudry
                and, above all, the sculptors like a Mercier, Dalou, they’re also among the very
                soundest. But peasants and labourers simply aren’t nude, and so one doesn’t have to
                think nude. The more people who start making figures of workmen and peasants the
                better I’ll like it. <good_health>And I myself, I know of nothing else in which I
                    take so much delight.</good_health> This is a long letter and I still don’t know
                whether I’ve said what I mean clearly enough. I may perhaps drop Serret a line. If I
                do, I’ll send the letter to you to read, because I want to make it clear how much I
                attach to this question of the figure.</p>

        <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
        <body>
            <p> I wish you much happiness for the new year, may it be blessed for you in many ways.
                    <good_health>Those were good days, when you were here, though they didn’t last
                    long.</good_health> My holiday will be over soon, too, but I’ll stay at least a
                day longer because Pa’s so busy these days, and it would be good to discuss calmly
                how best to pursue further study. </p>
            <p> Pa also has to preach at Princenhage on New Year’s Eve, because the Rev. Kuylman
                fell and hurt himself, dislocating his arm, and so is unable to take his turn on New
                Year’s Eve, and Pa has offered to do it for him. So Pa has to preach 9 times in 10
                days. </p>
            <p> If you haven’t yet sent that map. to Harry Gladwell, wait a while, I hear he’s no
                longer in Paris, wrote to his father today. I may get a reply and will then add
                something to the roll. </p>
            <p> You forgot to take the etching after Meissonier, I’ll send it to you one of these
                days with the lithograph after Jules Breton, The fields in winter, because I don’t
                want to accept it, it belongs in your collection. </p>
            <p>
                <unstress reason="friendship">It snowed last week and Cor had fun with the sledge
                    and so did I, because I sledged on the road with him and a girl who was staying
                    at the Hackstrohs’.</unstress>
                <unstress reason="family">Today Pa, Ma, Cor and I took a lovely walk</unstress>, you
                should have been there. </p>
            <p> Yesterday I saw the sewing school that Ma now holds in the consistory, it is indeed
                pleasant, one would like to have a painting of it, there are already quite a few
                children coming to it. </p>
            <p> Another painting has occurred to me that is related to Brittany, namely Ribot, The
                prayer, a number of children kneeling in a corner of a church at dusk, there’s a
                large etching by him of the same thing, which you perhaps know. Jacque once made an
                etching of the same subject, but smaller. </p>
            <p> Made a list today of everything I could remember about the French Revolution, so as
                to write it on the back of the map of France, and I hope gradually to expand on that
                work, recording, for instance, the most important things about the Middle Ages, or
                the time of the 80 Years’ War, and so on. One must hold on to what one has seen or
                what one knows, for it always comes in useful. </p>
            <p> If you should make such lists from time to time, send them to me when you have the
                opportunity, then we can compare them, it’s good to do so — as far as knowledge is
                concerned, it’s important to hold on to what one has and to absorb it internally as
                much as one can; especially when one is short of money, it’s good to fill the gaps
                with this and similar things.Give my regards to all your housemates and wish them
                all the best from me. It’s not impossible that, on my way to Amsterdam, I could
                spend another night in The Hague and bring you the prints that you left here myself,
                but don’t count on it. </p>
            <p>Adieu, again I wish you the best, and a hearty handshake in thought from</p>
