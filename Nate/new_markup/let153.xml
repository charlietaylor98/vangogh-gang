      <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
      <body>
            <p> I’m writing to you in haste. Won’t you be going to Paris quite soon now? If so,
                  write and tell me which day and what time, and in all likelihood I’ll see you at
                  the station. If you have time to stay here for a day, or longer or shorter, I
                  sincerely wish that this could happen. </p>
            <p> Would be able to show you some drawings, types from here, not that they alone make
                  it worth your while to get off the train, but <unstress reason="environment">here you would easily find something
                  that appeals to you in the scenery and in the singularity of everything, for
                  there’s so much picturesque character in everything in this region.</unstress> Have you ever
                  read Dickens, ‘Les temps difficiles’, I’m giving you the title in French because
                  there’s a very good French translation for 1.25 francs published by Hachette,
                  Bibliothèque des meilleurs romans étranger. It’s masterly, one of the characters
                  is a worker, Stephen Blackpool, who’s well portrayed and extremely likeable. </p>
            <p> Was recently in Brussels and MariaHorebeke and Tournai, partly on foot. </p>
            <p> Am at the following address at the momentMr Francq. Evangelist in CUESMES (at
                  Marais, near Mons).There have been a lot of storms here lately. </p>
            <p> Come on, old chap, if you can arrange it, come and stay over till the next train. </p>
            <p> Was recently in a studio, the Rev. Pieterszen’s, who paints in the style of
                  Schelfhout or Hoppenbrouwers and really understands art. </p>
            <p> <work origin="existing" stage="finished">He asked me for one of my sketches, a mineworker’s type.</work> <work stage="middle" origin="new">Often sit up drawing until
                  late at night to have some keepsakes and to strengthen thoughts that automatically
                  spring to mind upon seeing the things.</work><stress reason="career">But old boy, I don’t have any time, had to
                  write urgently to Mr Tersteeg to thank him for the box of paints he sent and the
                  sketchbook, already half full.</stress> In Brussels I bought another large sketchbook with
                  old Dutch paper from a Jewish bookseller. </p>
            <p> If I should get to see you, how pleased I’d be, I promise you Dickens, Les temps
                  difficiles, if you want to come and fetch it, but otherwise I’ll send it when I
                  get the chance. </p>
            <p> Adieu, accept a handshake in thought, and believe me ever </p>
