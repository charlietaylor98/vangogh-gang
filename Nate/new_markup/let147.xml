    <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
    <body>
        <p> I’m enclosing a few words with Pa and Ma’s letter to bid you good morning. It’s raining
            outside and has done so a lot lately, with strong winds too. It was nice the day Anna
            and Joan registered their banns. Now that Joan is here, Anna looks a lot more cheerful
            and better than before. For their honeymoon they’re thinking of making a journey through
            Belgium, first to Brussels and from there probably south to Liège or Chaudfontaine or
            the cave in Han. Wrote and told the Rev. De Jonge that I was ready to come to Brussels
            straightaway if work or duty should call me, but that if there were no sound reasons
            that made it desirable for me to go there now, I’d like to stay here another week
            (because of Anna’s wedding), coming in that case before Sunday, 25 Aug. I’m very curious
            to know whether the exhibition of paintings there will still be open, I should so much
            like to see it. </p>
        <p> <stress reason="family">Things are very sad at Princenhage, Aunt suffers a lot, and they’re all very worried
            about her.</stress> </p>
        <p> I long for a word from you, hope to write to you in more detail as soon as I’m in
            Brussels, also about the exhibition, at least if it isn’t over yet. </p>
        <p> Give my regards to Braat and Soek, if you see them, and Ernest. Adieu, I wish you the
            very best, not a day goes by that we don’t speak of you. Do write again soon, and accept
            a hearty handshake in thought from </p>
    </body>
    <close>Your loving brother</close>
