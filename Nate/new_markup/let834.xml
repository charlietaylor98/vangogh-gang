      <salutation>My dear Theo, </salutation>
      <body>
            <p>Yesterday I was pleasantly surprised by a visit from Mr Salles who, I believe, had
                  had a letter from you. I was completely well when he came so we were able to talk
                  calmly. But I’m most confused that he should have put himself out for me, the more
                  so because I hope that I’ve regained my presence of mind for a while. For the
                  moment it seems to me that the best thing will be to carry on here. I’ll see what
                  Mr Peyron says when I have a chance to speak to him; he’ll probably say that he
                  absolutely cannot guarantee anything in advance, which seems quite right to
                  me.</p>
            <p>Today I’m dispatching a few canvases, the following:Ploughed field with background of
                  mountains – it’s the same field of the reaper from this summer and can be a
                  pendant to it; I think that one will set off the other.</p>
            <p>The ravine. This is the study done on a day when the mistral was blowing – I had
                  wedged my easel in place with large stones – the painting of this isn’t dry, it’s
                  in a tauter drawing style, and there’s more suppressed passion and it has more
                  colour.</p>
            <p>This can go with another study of mountains, summer effect, with a road in the
                  foreground and a black hovel.</p>
            <p>Women picking olives – I’d intended this painting for our mother and sister so that
                  they might have something a little studied.</p>
            <p>I also have a repetition of it for you, and the study (more coloured with more solemn
                  tones) from nature.</p>
            <p>The fields. Fields of young wheat with background of lilac mountains and yellowish
                  sky.</p>
            <p>Olive trees. Orange and green sunset sky (there’s also a variant of it here with
                  figures).</p>
            <p>ditto, neutral effect.</p>
            <p>ditto ,, ,,.</p>
            <p>The tall plane trees, the main street or boulevard of StRémy, study from nature – I
                  have a repetition of it here which is perhaps more finished.</p>
            <p>Copy after Millet, The diggers.</p>
            <p>ditto The evening. I was forgetting the rain. Please don’t look at them without
                  putting them on stretching frames and framing them in white.</p>
            <p>That’s to say, you’ll remove the nails from other canvases and mount these on the
                  stretching frames, one by one if you like, to appreciate the effect. For the
                  colourings absolutely need to be set off by the white frame to judge the ensemble.
                  Thus the rain, the grey olive trees, one can scarcely see them without the
                  frame.</p>
            <p>This will somewhat fill the hole left by the canvases that have gone off to the
                  Vingtistes – you must ask Tanguy to remove the nails from other canvases and to
                  mount these on stretching frames so that they dry all the way through.</p>
            <p>In your previous letter you talk of Hugo’s drawings – I’ve just seen a volume of
                  Michelet’s (illustrated) Histoire de France. I saw admirable drawings in it by
                  Vierge which were completely like something by Victor Hugo, astonishing things. Do
                  you know that? When you see Mr Lauzet ask him if he knows them, there’s also a
                  resemblance with Hervier’s talent, but more complete, with more dramatic figures
                  and effects – it also resembles the illustrations for The life of Frederick the
                  Great by Menzel. Most curious.</p>
            <p>I think that Vierge has also gone to Charenton, but how that fellow has worked. At
                  one time Boggs had a magnificent wood engraving of his, probably published by
                  L’Illustration, Seabathing – a crowd of men and women – drawing in the manner of
                  Doré, who one day did precisely the same subject very well on a page also
                  published by L’Illustration – but then with Vierge there’s Daumier’s rich
                  execution in full.</p>
            <p>I hope that Jo’s health and yours are good, and that you no longer have any anxiety
                  on my account.</p>
            <p>Write to me if you can soon after receiving the canvases. Good handshake in thought
                  to you and your wife.</p>
