  <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
  <body>
    <p> <good_health>It felt wonderful to hear Gladwell’s voice in the hall as I sat upstairs studying and to see
      him a moment later and to shake his hand</good_health>.<unstress reason="environment"> Yesterday we took a nice walk through the main
      streets and past most of the churches</unstress>, and got up this morning before 5 to see the people
      coming to the dockyard and afterwards walked to Zeeburg and also saw a cemetery and went to
      the Trippenhuis (twice) and he alone to Van der Hoop, and he was also at Uncle Cor’s gallery
      (who isn’t in town, however) and with Mendes in the room. Now we also have plans to go to
      Uncle Stricker’s (because I’ve been invited to eat there today and will simply risk it and
      take him along), and if we have time also to see Vos and Kee. And I would also like very much
      to go with him to Bickerseiland, but perhaps there won’t be time. Have also strongly suggested
      that he go to Haarlem to see the paintings by Frans Hals, and now he’s going there and not to
      Antwerp as he had planned, but will save Belgium for later and is concentrating now
      exclusively on Holland. </p>
    <p> We also spent a lot of time in the little study and talked of things new and old. </p>
    <p> <unstress reason="friendship">When he’s sitting beside me I again feel the same feeling that drew me to him so often, as
      though he were a son of the same family and a brother in faith because he loves ‘the man of
      sorrows and acquainted with grief’.</unstress> Who is our God and in Whose teachings and resurrection we
      believe, Whose spirit we seek, of Whose love we ask that it constrain us in life and that
      nothing separate us from it, nor things present, nor things to come. In him, too, godly sorrow
      shall work that which in many it has worked and works and shall work, a choice not to be
      repented of, for that good part which shall not be taken away, and choosing the only thing
      necessary and worthy of bringing forth fruits meet for repentance. He is a Christian and will
      become one more and more. <unstress reason="friendship">This morning we read together the story of Elijah by the brook
      Cherith</unstress> and at the widow’s – because when we lived together in Montmartre we found that the
      barrel of meal did not waste and the cruse of water did not fail – and yesterday evening the
      parable of the sower and others. Now he’ll stay with you for a while as well, and is longing
      to see your little room and what you have in the way of prints. </p>
    <p> Received from him Bunyan, The pilgrim’s progress, that is an asset, as is Bossuet, Oraison
      funèbres, which I recently bought very cheaply, and The imitation by T. a Kempis in Latin,
      which I got from Vos and which I hope to be able to read in Latin some day.He read here
      various bits of Bungener, Esquiros, Lamennais, Souvestre, Lamartine (Cromwell), and took
      pleasure in the lithographs after Bosboom, we bought one from a Jew, and he gave me
      instructions to buy some more for him when the opportunity presents itself. </p>
    <p> I sincerely hope that you’ll have a pleasant evening with him, and I believe that the more
      you seek in him the more you will find in him. </p>
    <p> We talked about this and that, and what we said to each other is this: many, having come to
      a point in life where one must make a choice about life, have chosen for their part ‘the love
      of Christ and poverty’, or rather ‘give me neither poverty nor riches, feed me with bread
      convenient for me’. <unstress reason="friendship">The time together flew past for me, and I wished we could have stayed
      together a little longer; </unstress>but it cannot be, and everyone must return to his way and continue
      to do whatsoever the hand findeth to do in the calling wherein he was called, and <good_health>I for my
      part am thankful from the bottom of my heart that I was able to see him again</good_health>, and found in
      him that which drew me to him. He told me that you will certainly make the trip with the
      nouveautés, probably in about 4 weeks’ time, so I also hope to see you again then. </p>
    <p> I sincerely hope that he’ll have pleasant and good memories of his visit to Holland, it’s
      courageous of him to have persisted with that plan. </p>
    <p>Give my regards to your housemates, have a good evening with him; should wish for you to be
      attached to him as I feel attached to him at the moment, and accept in thought a handshake
      from</p>
  </body>
  <close>Your most loving brother</close>
  <sig>Vincent</sig>
  <ps><p>You’ve no doubt heard about the death of Mrs Richard; it must have been a difficult night. To
    learn the Bible well and thoroughly and with love, would that not be a very desirable
    thing?</p></ps>
