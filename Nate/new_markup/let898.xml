    <head>Auvers-sur-Oise, on or about Thursday, 10 July 1890</head>
    <salutation>Dear brother and sister,</salutation>
    <body>
        <p>Jo’s letter was really like a gospel for me, a deliverance from anguish which I was
            caused by the rather difficult and laborious hours for us all that I shared with you.
            It’s no small thing when all together we feel the daily bread in danger, no small thing
            when for other causes than that we also feel our existence to be fragile. O<bad_health>nce back here
            I too still felt very saddened, and had continued to feel the storm that threatens you
            also weighing upon me.</bad_health><stress reason="family"> What can be done – you see I usually try to be quite
            goodhumoured, but my life, too, is attacked at the very root, my step also is faltering.
            I feared – not completely – but a little nonetheless – that I was a danger to you,
            living at your expense – </stress>but Jo’s letter clearly proves to me that you really feel that
            for my part I am working and suffering like you.</p>
        <p><work origin="new" stage="finished">There – once back here I set to work again – the brush however almost falling from my
            hands and – knowing clearly what I wanted I’ve painted another three large canvases
            since then. They’re immense stretches of wheatfields under turbulent skies, and I made a
            point of trying to express sadness, extreme loneliness. </work>You’ll see this soon, I hope –
            for I hope to bring them to you in Paris as soon as possible, since I’d almost believe
            that these canvases will tell you what I can’t say in words, what I consider healthy and
            fortifying about the countryside.</p>
        <p><work stage="planned" origin="new">Now the third canvas is Daubigny’s garden, a painting I’d been thinking about ever since
            I’ve been here.</work></p>
        <p>I hope with all my heart that the planned journey may provide you with a little
            distraction.</p>
        <p>I often think of the little one, I believe that certainly it’s better to bring up
            children than to expend all one’s nervous energy in making paintings, but what can you
            do, I myself am now, at least I feel I am, too old to retrace my steps or to desire
            something else. <bad_health>This desire has left me, although the moral pain of it remains.</bad_health></p>
        <p>I very much regret not having seen Guillaumin again, but it pleases me that he’s seen my
            canvases.</p>
        <p>If I’d waited for him I would probably have stayed to talk with him in such a way as to
            miss my train.</p>
        <p>Wishing you luck and good heart and relative prosperity, please tell Mother and Sister
            sometime that I think of them very often, besides this morning I have a letter from them
            and will reply shortly.</p>
    </body>
    <close>Handshakes in thought.Ever yours,</close>

        <p><stress reason="money"> My money won’t last me very long this time, as on my return I had to pay the baggage
            costs from Arles.</stress> I retain very good memories of this trip to Paris. A few months ago I
            little dared hope to see our friends again. I thought that Dutch lady had a great deal
            of talent. </p>
        <p> Lautrec’s painting, portrait of a female musician, is quite astonishing, it moved me
            when I saw it. </p>
