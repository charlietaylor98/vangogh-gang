      <salutation>My dear brother,</salutation>
      <body>
            <p>Today, as Mr Peyron had come back, I read your kind letters, then the letters from
                  home as well, and that did me an enormous amount of good in giving me back a
                  little energy, or rather the desire to climb back up again from the dejected state
                  I’m in. I thank you very much for the etchings – you’ve chosen some of the very
                  ones that I’ve already liked for a long time, the David, the Lazarus, the
                  Samaritan, and the large etching of the wounded man, and you’ve added the blind
                  man and the other very small etching, the last one so mysterious that I’m afraid
                  of it and dare not wish to know what it is. I didn’t know it, the little
                  goldsmith. But the Lazarus! Early this morning I looked at it and I remembered not
                  only what Charles Blanc says of it, but indeed even that he doesn’t say everything
                  about it.</p>
            <p>The unfortunate thing is that the people here are too curious, idle and ignorant
                  about painting for it to be possible for me to practise my profession. This is
                  what one could always observe, that you and I made an effort here in the same
                  direction as some others who weren’t understood either, and were bitterly saddened
                  by circumstances. If ever you go to Montpellier you would see that what I tell you
                  here is true.</p>
            <p>Now, rather, you propose coming back to the north, and I accept.</p>
            <p>I’ve had too hard a life to kick the bucket as a result, or to lose the power to
                  work.</p>
            <p>So Gauguin and Guillaumin, the two of them, want to do an exchange for the landscape
                  of the Alpilles. Besides, there are two of them, only I think that the one
                  finished last, which I’ve just sent, is done with more determination and is more
                  accurate in expression.</p>
            <p>I’m perhaps going to try to work from the Rembrandts, above all I have an idea to do
                  the man at prayer in the range of tones running from bright yellow to violet.</p>
            <p>Included is Gauguin’s letter, do what you think best as regards the exchange, take
                  the ones you like for yourself; I’m sure that our taste is increasingly becoming
                  the same.</p>
            <p>Ah, if I’d been able to work without this bloody illness! How many things I could
                  have done, isolated from the others, according to what the land would tell me. But
                  yes – this journey is well and truly finished. Anyway, what consoles me is the
                  great, the very great desire that I have to see you again, you, your wife and your
                  child, and so many friends who have remembered me in my misfortune, as, for that
                  matter, I don’t stop thinking of them either.</p>
            <p>I’m almost sure that I’ll soon get better in the north, at least for quite a long
                  time, while still apprehensive of a relapse in a few years’ time – but not
                  immediately. That’s what I imagine after having observed the other patients here,
                  some of whom are considerably older than I am or, among the young ones, were more
                  or less idlers – students. Anyway, what do we know about it?</p>
            <p>Fortunately the letters from our sister and mother were very calm. Our sister writes
                  very well, and describes a landscape or an aspect of the town as if it were a page
                  from a modern novel. I always urge her to busy herself with domestic rather than
                  artistic things, for I know that she’s already too sensitive, and at her age would
                  have difficulty in finding the way to artistic development. I’m really afraid that
                  she too will suffer from a thwarted artistic will. But she’s so energetic that
                  she’ll make up for it. I talked with Mr Peyron about the situation, and told him
                  that it was almost impossible for me to bear my fate here, that not knowing
                  anything very clear regarding the line to take, it seemed preferable to me to
                  return to the north.</p>
            <p>If you think this is a good idea, and if you suggest a date when you expect me over
                  there in Paris, I would have someone from here accompany me part of the way, as
                  far as Tarascon or Lyon. Then you would wait for me, or have someone wait for me,
                  at the station in Paris. Do what seems best to you. For the time being I would
                  leave my furniture behind in Arles. It’s with friends, and I’m sure they’d send it
                  the day I wanted it. But the carriage and packing would be almost what it’s worth.
                  I consider this as a shipwreck, this journey, well, one can’t do as one wants, and
                  as one ought to either. Once I got out a little into the park I recovered all my
                  clarity for work, I have more ideas in my head than I could ever put into action,
                  but without it dazzling me. The brushstrokes go like a machine. So based on that I
                  dare believe that in the north I would rediscover my confidence once freed from
                  surroundings and circumstances which I neither understand nor wish to understand.
                  It was very kind of Mr Peyron to write to you, he’s writing to you again today, I
                  leave him regretting that I have to leave him. Good handshake to you and to Jo, I
                  thank her very much for her letter.</p>
