    <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
    <body>
        <p> I’m enclosing a note in the letter from Pa and Ma; was glad to hear things are still
            going well for you there, and that you also continue to enjoy life. How much I’d like to
            walk with you there. </p>
        <p> As Pa has certainly already written to you, Pa and I went to Brussels last week in the
            company of the Rev. Jones of Isleworth, who stayed here over Sunday. The impression we
            brought home from that journey was satisfactory inasmuch as we think that, with time, a
            place and position can be found there — that the road is most certainly shorter and less
            expensive than in Holland, and that it’s therefore best to fix our eyes on Belgium and
            to go on looking there until we find something. </p>
        <p> We saw the Flemish training college, it has a 3year course while, as you know, in
            Holland the study would take another 6 years at the very least. And one is not even
            required to complete the training before competing for a place and position as an
            Evangelist. What is required is the talent to give easy, warmhearted and popular
            lectures or speeches to the people, better short and to the point than long and learned.
            So less attention is paid to great knowledge of ancient languages and much theological
            study, although everything one knows about such things is a great recommendation, and
            more consideration is given to one’s suitability for practical work and one’s natural
            faith. <stress reason ="career">We aren’t there yet, though, first of all because one doesn’t suddenly possess,
            nor can one acquire it except by much practice, the gift of speaking to the people with
            earnestness and feeling and without stiffness and forcedness, but naturally and as
            though constrained by love and as a master of his subject matter, knowing how to say
            what one has to say to the people clearly and understandably, while what one has to say
            must have meaning and import and strong grounds to whet his listeners’ interest in it,
            that they shall endeavour to let their affections take root in truth.</stress> In a word, one
            must be a lay preacher to succeed over there.Those gentlemen in Brussels wanted me to
            come there for a period of 3 months to make closer acquaintance, but in the long run
            this, too, would be costly, and that must be avoided as much as possible. It’s for this
            reason that at present I shall continue here in Etten to do some work as preparation,
            going from here from time to time to pay a visit to the Rev. Pieterszen in Mechelen or
            the Rev. De Jonge in Brussels, in so doing becoming more closely acquainted with one
            another. </p>
        <p> How long things go on like this depends entirely on what else they’ll say over there.
            Both Pa and I have just written to them again. </p>
        <p> Pa wants me to write, to the best of my ability, a theme or two to have on hand (<work origin="new" stage="middle">I’m now
            busy, for instance, on Rembrandt’s painting ‘The carpenter’s house’ in the Louvr</work>e). </p>
        <p> Yesterday Pa had to preach at Zundert, and I went along. The Aunts sent you their
            regards, we also went to C. van Ginneken who, as you’ve probably heard, is going to
            marry Marie van Mens and has bought the Ropsentuin to put a tannery there. </p>
        <p> Was also at Jan Doomen’s, who has been suffering a lot from rheumatism in his leg, and
            complains that he wouldn’t even be able to walk to Breda any more, but it didn’t bother
            him so much working in the field or the garden, only in the morning the pain drove him
            to get up very early. Old age is accompanied by ailments, the old Rev. Meijjes would
            say. </p>
        <p> What an outstandingly beautiful wood engraving of ‘A young citizen of the year V’ by
            Jules Goupil was recently published in L’Illustration! Have you seen it? Have managed to
            get hold of one and it’s now hanging on the wall of the little room here where I’m
            allowed to take up residence, i.e. the classroom that looks out on the garden and
            against which the ivy grows. But regarding that painting, the magazine said this: ‘Eyes
            that have seen the spectacle of the dreadful guillotine, a mind that has survived all
            the sights of the Revolution. He is almost surprised to find himself still alive after
            so many disasters’. </p>
        <p> It was a remarkable presence in art and will continue to have a similar effect on many
            and continue to make a deep impression on those with a feeling for high art, like a
            portrait by Fabritius or some other rather mystical paintings from the school of
            Rembrandt. </p>
        <p> <unstress reason="environment">In the evening, when we rode back from Zundert over the heath, Pa and I walked a way,
            the sun set red behind the pines and the evening sky was reflected in the marshes, the
            heath and the yellow and white and grey sand were so resonant with tone and atmosphere.</unstress>
            <good_health>You see, there are moments in life when everything, within us too, is peace and
            atmosphere, and all of life seems to be like a path across the heath, though it isn’t
            always so.</good_health> </p>
        <p> And this morning Cor, who’s on holiday, and I went to the heath and the pinewood again,
            a way past Molenend, and went to fetch heather for his rabbits, which are apparently
            very fond of it, for it’s their natural food for a good part, as well as a thing or two
            to fill a flower basket. We sat for a while in the pinewood, and together we drew a map
            of Etten and its surroundings with the Bremberg and Haansberg and ’t Slagveld and
            Geestestraat and Sprundel and Het Heike and Hoeven. </p>
        <p> Anna is but poorly, she’s so quiet and sometimes looks so very weak — poor sister — it
            seems to me that it’s better to be well and truly married than to be engaged, and I
            should sincerely wish for her sake that she were already safely three years or so
            further along in life — may God spare her and protect her from all evil, He about Whom
            it is written that He is our Keeper and our Shade upon our right hand. </p>
        <p> Would you give my warm regards to Soek and all his family (if you happen to go there),
            also to Frans Braat and Ernest and the others if the opportunity should arise? I think
            about you a lot and am so glad that things are going well for you and that you’re
            finding things over there that stimulate you and are, as it were, good food for the true
            life. That too is high art, as are the works of those who work with their heart and with
            their mind and spirit, just as so many you know and will perhaps meet personally, whose
            words and works are spirit and life. That you too, and, if possible, all of us may
            become more and more rooted and grounded in that same principle, so that our affections
            take root in truth, this is wished you with a hearty handshake in thought by </p>
    </body>
