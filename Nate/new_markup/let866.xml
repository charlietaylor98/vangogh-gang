      <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
      <body>
            <p><good_health>Once again I’m writing to you to say that I’m staying well</good_health>, yet<stress reason="environment"> I feel a little worn
                  out by this long crisis, </stress>and I dare believe that the planned move will refresh my
                  ideas more.</p>
            <p>I think that it’ll be best for me to go myself to see this doctor in the country as
                  soon as possible; then we can soon decide if I’m going to lodge with him or
                  temporarily at the inn; and thus we’ll avoid an overlong stay in Paris, a thing
                  that I would fear. You remember that 6 months ago I told you after a crisis that
                  if it happened again I would ask you to let me move? <bad_health>We’re at that point –
                  although I don’t feel capable of passing judgement on the way they have of dealing
                  with the patients here – it’s enough that I feel that what remains to me of reason
                  and capacity for work is absolutely in danger. </bad_health>While, on the contrary, I’m
                  confident that I can prove to this doctor you speak of that I still know how to
                  work logically, and he’ll treat me accordingly, and since he likes painting
                  there’s sufficient chance that a solid friendship will result from it.</p>
            <p>I don’t think Mr Peyron will oppose a very prompt departure. Besides, I tell myself
                  that the pleasure of spending a few days with you will do me a lot of good. And
                  from that moment on we can really count on a period of relative health. So don’t
                  delay in taking the necessary steps so that this doesn’t drag on. Once I’m there I
                  can send for my bed, which is in Arles.</p>
            <p><stress reason="environment">Besides, I would move anyway, preferring to be in an asylum where the patients worked
                  to this awful idleness here, which really seems to me quite simply a crime.</stress>
                  Anyway, you’ll tell me that this is seen more or less everywhere, and that there’s
                  even plenty of it in Paris. Whatever the case, I hope that we’ll see each other
                  again very soon.</p>
            <p>The etchings you sent me are really beautiful. Opposite this I’ve scribbled a croquis
                  after a painting I’ve done of three figures which are in the background of the
                  Lazarus etching.</p>
            <p><work origin="new" stage="finished">The dead man and his two sisters.The cave and the corpse are violet, yellow, white.
                  The woman who is taking the handkerchief from the resurrected man’s face has a
                  green dress and orange hair, the other has black hair and a striped garment. Green
                  and pink. Behind a countryside, blue hills, a yellow rising sun. The combination
                  of colours would thus itself speak of the same thing expressed by the chiaroscuro
                  of the etching.</work> If I were still to have at my disposal the model who posed for the
                  Berceuse and the other whose portrait you’ve just received after Gauguin’s
                  drawing, then certainly I’d try to execute it in a large size, this canvas, the
                  personalities being what I would have dreamed of as characters. But leaving aside
                  subjects of this kind, there will still remain the study from life of peasants and
                  landscapes when I’m back in the north.</p>
            <p>As regards the order for colours. Should I remain here for another few days, please
                  send off part of it at once. If, however, I leave in the next few days – which I
                  hope – you can keep it in Paris.</p>
            <p>In any event, write to me in the next few days; I hope that you’ll have received the
                  canvases in good order. <work stage="finished" origin="new">I’ve done another one of a nook of greenery which seems to
                  me to have some freshness.</work> <work origin="new" stage="middle">I’ve also attempted a copy of Delacroix’s Good
                  Samaritan. </work>I think from a note in Le Figaro that père Quost must have a darned
                  good painting in the Salon.</p>
            <p>Warm regards to your wife, I’m very much looking forward to making her acquaintance
                  at last, and good handshake in thought.</p>
      </body>
      <close>Ever yours, </close>
