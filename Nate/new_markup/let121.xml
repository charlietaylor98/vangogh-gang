  <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
  <body>
    <p> Well, what do you say about Anna? <unstress reason="family">It surprised me, and it seems to be serious too, and will
      certainly take place, one would venture to say. It could be good.</unstress> The difficulties of holding
      a subordinate position, especially when one perseveres in it for a longer period, as she has
      in fact done for years in all honour and virtue, are very great and sometimes become a hard
      struggle, and the seemingly easy becomes extremely difficult. </p>
    <p>There’s nevertheless much poetry in it, and such years are a treasure not easily lost, and
      when one denies and humbles oneself, especially the first time, one has a wonderful feeling of
      inner peace, <bad_health>but I would understand very well if the future was sometimes dark for her too</bad_health> –
      it might be sensible of her, for her part, to have already decided to take this step. And I
      also maintain that she truly loves him, I believe that and trust in it absolutely, otherwise
      things wouldn’t have gone this far. And so I sincerely hope that she won’t be disappointed but
      that this, with God’s guidance, will be the path to her lasting happiness. May the Lord grant
      that she find peace, that dear sister, and bless her, and give her good things in life. On
      this occasion I congratulate you, too, as I have Anna and Pa and Ma. </p>
    <p>How are you, old chap? I had wanted to write to you earlier and answer your last letter. I
      have a lot to do and the work isn’t easy.</p>
    <p><unstress reason="environment">Then again, I go to church a lot, there are beautiful old churches here, and outstanding
      preachers, I often hear Uncle Stricker, and what he says is very good, and he speaks with much
      warmth and feeling. </unstress>I’ve heard the Rev. Laurillard three times, you would like him too,
      because he paints, as it were, and his work is at once lofty and noble art. He has the feeling
      of an artist in the true sense of the word, as someone like Andersen had when he says, for
      example:</p>
    <p>Every evening came the moon and whispered in my ear, Telling of the quiet night and what its
      eye Had lit on from its watchpost in the sky. It who knows centuries – through ages did it
      roam, Casting, high above the Flood and crest of foam, On the floating ark a soft silver glow,
      Just as it now lights my lonely window Then, too, when the folk of Israel knelt down To weep
      by the waters of Babylon It illumined with sad twinkling down below The unstrung harp, hanging
      on the willow.</p>
    <p> The moon still shines now, and the sun and the evening star, which is fortunate, and they
      often speak of God’s Love and call to mind the words, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the
      end of the world. </p>
    <p> <work origin="new" stage="middle">Am busy making a summary of the history of the Reformation</work>, there’s much that is stimulating
      and appealing in the history of those days. </p>
    <p> <unstress reason="environment">The room in the Trippenhuis where Rembrandt’s Syndics are hanging is open again; coming from
      church yesterday I walked over there for a while,</unstress> hanging right next to the Rembrandt is that
      portrait by Van der Helst. </p>
    <p> Adieu, Theo, a hearty handshake in thought, I wish you the very best, and believe that often
      thinking of you is</p>
  </body>
  <close>Your most loving brother</close>

      housemates and if someone or other should ask after me.</p>
