  <salutation>>My dear Theo,</salutation>
  <body>
    <p> It’s time you received a few words from me, Pa already wrote that you’ve arrived safely and
      have already written how you roamed around the city the first few days. I’m really longing to
      hear what your impressions are of this and that, and that’s why I urge you to write a few
      words as soon as you can find the time. It’s true, though, that first impressions don’t last,
      for we know all too well that all that glitters is not gold, and that when there is a friendly
      dawn there is a midnight too, and scorching and oppressive heat in the afternoon. But just as
      the morning hour is a blessed hour and the early bird catches the worm, so it is with first
      impressions, and they have their value even though they pass, for it is they which later
      appear to have been correct, and one comes back to them. The first thing that attracts and
      strikes a child is the light, and an old man also searches again fearfully for it. So write
      and tell me what you saw during those first few days, and what you thought. </p>
    <p> <stress reason="family">You’ll have heard that Lies didn’t pass her exam and has fallen ill, and that because she
      longed so much for home, Ma went to fetch her, poor girl, it will be no small disappointment
      for her and for everyone at home, and yesterday was perhaps a less cheerful Sunday.</stress> Pa
      nevertheless wrote again, and in his mouth that is the truth, that with all disappointment and
      at every serious moment of life, faith becomes more alive and stronger. </p>
    <p><unstress reason="environment"> The weather has been beautiful here the last few days, and probably in Paris too. You’ll
      soon notice that in the summer it’s at times rather warmer there than it is here, and you’ll
      probably see stormy skies like those Bonington painted.</unstress> It’s really a nice neighbourhood where
      you live. If one roams the streets there, whether in the morning or evening, or walks in the
      direction of Montmartre, one is struck by many workshops and many rooms that recall ‘a cooper’
      or The seamstresses or other paintings by E. Frère, and it does one good sometimes to see such
      things, which are simple, as one occasionally sees a good many people who for various reasons
      have strayed a long way from everything that is natural, thereby throwing away their true and
      inner lives, and also many who are rooted in misery and loathsome things, because in the
      evening and at night one sees all manner of those dark figures walking about, both men and
      women, who personify, as it were, the terror of the night, and whose misery must be classified
      among the things that have no name in any language. </p>
    <p> <stress reason="friendship">Vos isn’t well, he has coughed up blood again more than once. </stress>Was there recently one
      afternoon when he was up, sitting hand in hand with Kee, both of them dressed in black and
      their faces equally pale, looking out of the window at the Church and the trees across the
      street, when there was a dark stormy sky and the leaves and the dust were whirling around in a
      strange way and the pavingstones looked so much whiter than usual, and the little black
      figures of the people stood out against them so much more sharply, as is often the case before
      a thunderstorm. He has become so much paler and thinner than when you saw him, and sometimes
      looks like a ghost. It has become a veritable house of mourning, and Uncle Stricker’s too, in
      fact, for when one member suffers, all the members suffer with it, for they have been planted
      together. </p>
    <p> Last week one of the ministers here died who was very well known throughout the country
      (Pantekoek). The funeral was on Saturday, it was something that reminded one of ‘In memoriam’,
      that procession along the path by the green borders of the Amstel. He was the father of 6
      children, the eldest around 20. A very large crowd followed, literally jostling one another.
      Yesterday there were sermons occasioned by the event in nearly every church. Heard Uncle
      Stricker, among others, who had been a close acquaintance of his. It was his turn to preach in
      the Oudezijdskapel, where the boys from the orphanage and those from the nautical college
      usually go. There was a lot of spirit in it, spoke, among other things, of the words: Now is
      my soul troubled; and what shall I say? It was a long and terrible suffering that was his lot.
      Heard one of his last sermons one evening, and even then it was clearly evident from what he
      said that he trembled at and recoiled from each new day and night, and especially from one
      that followed upon the effort of preaching. Even then one couldn’t hear him without feeling
      for him, as it were, and one couldn’t help shuddering, for it is a dark path, the one to his
      long home, and happy is he who, when that darkness and night are approaching, is strengthened
      even then by the hope for a better life and the resurrection as we know befell Mary Magdalen
      and Him Whom she supposed to be the gardener in the garden by the sepulchre, by the hope: who
      knows what shall be on the morrow? Saw his son yesterday at the early service, if one can
      compare the faces of people with other faces, then his looks very much like an eagle,
      especially then, when he was stricken by what had just happened. </p>
    <p> You must try to read some beautiful book or other over there, by Michelet, for instance, on
      the Revolution or something by Thoré or T. Gautier on Paris and the time of the young painters
      and writers. Oh, old boy, how I’d like to roam through the city with you. </p>
    <p> Hope to take a long walk today through a neighbourhood I haven’t seen much of yet. I found
      the house in Breestraat where Rembrandt lived. We talked about it, you know, when you were
      here. </p>
    <p> Don’t forget about that painting in the Luxembourg, He that receiveth you receiveth me, and
      he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me, and write and tell me who made it. </p>
    <p> It can be so glorious in Paris in the autumn, well, you’ll be seeing something of it at the
      end of September. </p>
    <p> Give my warm regards to everyone at the Soeks’, I still think so often of an excursion I
      made with his family to Villed’Avray. Going into the church there, it struck me that there
      was, I believe, even more than one painting by Corot hanging there. You know that he spent a
      lot of time there. </p>
    <p>Bid goodday to Braat, and Mutters too. I wish you well, and write soon, and accept in thought
      a hearty handshake, and believe me ever</p>
  </body>
  <close>Your most loving brother</close>
