  <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
  <body>
    <p>Thanks for your last letter, which I was glad to get. Yes, old boy, that etching after Jules
      Goupil is beautiful and forms, with all that’s associated with it, a fine and good whole that
      is a thing to keep in one’s heart. I rather envy your having read Carlyle, ‘French
      Revolution’, it’s not unknown to me but didn’t read all of it, I found parts of it in another
      book, namely by Taine. </p>
    <p> <work origin="new" stage="middle">Am busy making an extract from Motley, including capture of Den Briel and siege of Haarlem,
      Alkmaar and Leiden, have drawn a map to go with it,</work> so as to complete it. <work origin="new" stage="finished">Have also finished
      an extract from Bunyan’s Pilgrim’s progress.</work> <stress reason="career">Am working all the time, day in, day out, so some
      things do get done.</stress> </p>
    <p> I keep my work together, everything <stress reason="career">aimed at getting through the exams</stress>, I consult Mendes on
      everything, and model my studies on what he has done, for that is how I’d like to do it too.
      That history of the 80 Years’ War is really wonderful, anyone would do well to make such a
      good fight of his life. <stress reason="career">Truly life is a fight, and one must defend oneself and resist and make
      plans and calculations with a cheerful and alert mind in order to make it through and get
      ahead. It becomes no easier the further one gets in life</stress>, and it has been rightly said: </p>
    <p>Does the road go uphill then all the way? ‘Yes to the very end’ And will the journey take all
      day long? ‘From morn till night, my friend.’</p>
    <p><good_health>But by fighting the difficulties in which one finds oneself, an inner strength develops from
      within our heart,</good_health> which improves in life’s fight (one matures in the storm), if we always
      endeavour to keep that heart out of which are the issues of life, good and simple and rich
      toward God, to restore that and make it thus more and more, and to bear in mind the words that
      we must have a good conscience before God and before people. </p>
    <p> As we regard others so are we regarded by many eyes. It is from the conscience — God’s
      finest gift, and the proof that His eye is upon us, allseeing and allknowing, and also the
      assurance that He be not far from every one of us, but as our shade upon our right hand, and
      that He keeps us from the evil — that our light comes in the darkness of life and of the
      world. And if we feel an eye watching us, as it were, then it is good to gaze upward sometimes
      as though seeing Him who is invisible.I know that life of Frederick the Great illustrated by
      Menzel, that’s a good acquisition, do go on with that collection; I also know that woodcut
      after Jacque, The sheepfold, do bring those things home with you at Christmas. </p>
    <p> Have bought from the Jew that lithograph after L. Steffens of which you once showed me the
      painting, an old and a young priest conversing in a garden, it’s a good lithograph. The scene
      reminds me of a painting by Jacquand, photographed in the cartes de visite, it’s called ‘The
      new vicar’, I believe, it has the same sentiment, and also of The novice by G. Doré. </p>
    <p> <stress reason="career">Old boy, Latin and Greek and studying are difficult</stress>, but a<good_health>ll the same I feel very happy with
      it and am doing the things I have longed for.</good_health> I’m no longer allowed to sit up late in the
      evenings, Uncle has very strictly forbidden it — yet the words written below the etching by
      Rembrandt stick in my mind, In medio noctis vim suam lux exerit (In the middle of the night
      the light diffuses its strength) and I make sure that a small gaslight goes on burning the
      whole night, and lie looking at it often in medio noctis, <good_health>thinking about my plan for work the
      following day and considering how to go about that studying as well as possible.</good_health> Hope in the
      winter to light the fire early in the morning (and while obeying Uncle yet letting the light
      shine in the night and darkness once in a while). The winter mornings have something special
      about them, Frère painted that in that workman, ‘A cooper’ (the etching is hanging in your
      room, I believe), among other things. </p>
    <p> Fill my soul with a holy bitterness that shall be agreeable to Thee, and I shall humbly
      spend all the years of my life in Thy service, in the bitterness of my soul, yea, even in Thy
      Service, O Man of sorrows and acquainted with grief. That is certainly a good prayer, and I
      thought of it when I told you in simplicity that it was good to steep oneself in coffee in
      everyday life. </p>
    <p> A person has needs, and requires strength and fortification to be able to work. And one must
      make do with what one has and fight with such weapons as are within one’s reach, and use the
      means at one’s disposal to make the most of it and gain from it. </p>
    <p> (You can see from my handwriting that it had grown dark, but now the lamp is on.) Ate
      hotchpot at Uncle Stricker’s one afternoon, and it occurred to me on that occasion to make
      that extract from Motley, I’ll show it to you at Christmas. Because here in town I’ve seen and
      walked over so awfully many doorsteps and church floors and flights of steps up to houses, it
      occurred to me to make those maps of rocky Scotland, and while colouring them in (green and
      red) I thought of those pickles that Uncle is so fond of and I’ve grown fond of too. A
      person’s soul is a singularly strange thing, and it is good, I think, to have one like a map
      of England made with love and to have in it as much as possible of that love which is holy and
      beareth all things and believeth all things and hopeth all things and endureth all things and
      never faileth.<good_health> That Love is the Light of the world, the true life that is the light of men.
      The knowledge of languages is certainly a good thing to have, and I follow after in the hope
      that I might also grasp something of it.</good_health> </p>
    <p> When one eats a crust of black rye bread it’s certainly good to think of the words ‘Tunc
      justi fulgebunt ut sol in regnum Patris sui’ (Then shall the righteous shine forth as the Sun
      in the Kingdom of their Father), or also when one very often has muddy boots or wet, dirty
      clothes. May we all at sometime enter into that kingdom which is not of this world, where they
      do not marry and are not given in marriage, where the sun shall be no more thy light by day,
      neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee, but the Lord shall be an
      Everlasting Light, and God our glory, where the sun shall no more go down, neither shall the
      moon withdraw itself, for the Lord shall be thine Everlasting Light, and the days of mourning
      shall be ended and God shall wipe away all tears from the eyes. And so we can be leavened with
      the leaven of ‘sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing’, being what we are through God’s grace, having
      in the secret recesses of the heart the words ‘I never despair’ because we have faith in God.
      And then ‘Set your face as a flint’ are really good words in many circumstances, and also ‘be
      like an iron pillar or like an old oak tree’. It’s also good to love thorns, such as the
      thornhedges around the little English church or the roses in the cemetery, they’re so
      beautiful these days, yes, if one could make oneself a crown of the thorns of life, not for
      the people but with which one is seen by God, then one would do well. </p>
    <p> I imagine you know the woodcuts by Swain, he’s a clever man, his studio is in such a nice
      part of London, not far from that part of the Strand where the offices of the illustrated
      magazines are (Ill. Lond. News, The Graphic, Seeley), not far from Booksellers’ Row either,
      full of all kinds of bookstalls and shops where one sees all kinds of things, from the
      etchings of Rembrandt to the Household edition of Dickens and Chandos classics, everything
      there has a green cast (especially in foggy weather in the autumn, or during the dark days
      before Christmas), and it’s a place that immediately reminds one of Ephesus, as it is
      described with such singular simplicity in Acts. (Similarly, the bookshops in Paris are also
      so interesting, in the Faubourg St Germain, for instance.) </p>
    <p> <stress reason="career">Old boy, how inexpressibly happy I’ll be if I manage to pass my exams, if I conquer the
      difficulties it will be done in singleness of heart,</stress> but also with prayer to God, for I so
      often pray fervently to Him for the wisdom I’m in need of, and that He may one day grant that
      I write and deliver many sermons, the more like our Father’s the better, and to complete a
      Work in my life to which end all things work together for good. </p>
    <p> I was at Uncle Cor’s on Monday evening, and also saw Aunt and the whole family, all send you
      their warm regards. Stayed rather a long time because I hadn’t seen Aunt for a long time and
      one offends so easily without meaning to by giving the impression of not appreciating and of
      neglecting people. Looked through that book at Uncle’s, the engraved oeuvre of C. Daubigny.
      Went from there to Uncle Stricker’s, Uncle was out but a son of the Rev. Meyboom was visiting
      (brother of Margreet), an officer in the Navy, and his girlfriend and a young man, Middelbeek,
      who has been in London for a while and is going back there.At 10 o’clock Uncle came home
      soaking wet, for it was raining quite a lot that evening, and I had a long talk with him and
      Aunt, because Mendes had paid them a visit a couple of days ago (one shouldn’t utter the word
      genius lightly, even if one believes that there is more of it in the world than many people
      think, but Mendes certainly is a very remarkable person, and I’m happy and grateful for my
      contact with him) and hadn’t given them a bad report, fortunately, but <stress reason="career">Uncle asked me if it
      wasn’t difficult, and I admitted that it was very difficult and that I was doing my best to
      bear up and to be alert in all kinds of ways.</stress> He gave me encouragement, however. But now
      there’s still that terrible algebra and geometry, anyway, we’ll see — after Christmas I have
      to have lessons in those as well, there’s nothing for it. </p>
    <p> I also cling to the church and to the bookshops, if I can think of an errand to do there I
      do it. Today, for instance, I was at Schalekamp’s and at C.L. Brinkman’s in Hartestraat (that
      shop of Schalekamp’s is an interesting sight) and bought a couple of maps from the Teachers’
      Society, of which there are around 100 at a stuiver apiece, including the Netherlands in every
      possible historical period. (So often, in the past as well, a visit to a bookshop has cheered
      me up and reminded me that there are good things in the world.) </p>
    <p> <unstress reason="environment">Sunday morning I went to the early service and afterwards to the French church, where I
      heard an outstanding sermon from the Rev. Gagnebin</unstress>: the house at Bethany. ‘One thing is
      needful and Mary hath chosen that good part’. That Rev. Gagnebin has a pleasant appearance and
      a worthy head, and his face has something of the Peace of God which passeth all understanding.
      He does have something, I think, either of that priest in The last victims of the terror or of
      that humble and faithful manservant one sees in ‘The women of the boardinghouse’. </p>
    <p> That painting by Israëls you describe must be beautiful, I can picture it from your clear
      description. Saw a small painting of his at C.M.’s, also one by Mauve, very beautiful,
      shepherd with flock of sheep in the dunes. </p>
    <p> A good cheerful letter from home too, fortunately things seem to be going better in
      Princenhage. I’m longing not a little for Christmas, do bring one thing and another with you,
      as much as possible, it’s good for all of us. Don’t be in a hurry to send the tobacco; still
      have some, it’s a good and necessary aid to study. </p>
    <p> Wrote a long letter to Harry Gladwell that went off today, also sent your regards. If you
      have the time and the opportunity, think of Michelet, you know what, and J. Breton, but you
      know what it’s for and that there’s no hurry, and if necessary Christmas is soon enough. Now,
      I must get to work and the sheet of paper is nearly full, I wish you well, write if possible,
      I gave Uncle the receipt enclosed in your letter. Uncle sends you his regards, also Uncle and
      Aunt Stricker. Bid your housemates goodday from me, and should the opportunity arise also
      Mauve and his wife and the Tersteegs and Van Stockums (how is she?) and Haanebeeks, and
      Borchers if you run into him. Blessings on everything you do, I wish you strength and vigour
      in these autumn days, and let it be Christmas again with us together again before we know it,
      as it were, adieu, a handshake in thought, and believe me ever </p>

    <p>Saw 2 photos of Gabriel Max, the raising of Jairus’ daughter and a nun in a convent garden,
      the first one, in particular, was beautiful.Do you know an engraving after Landseer? It’s
      called The highlander, I believe, a highlander in a snowstorm on top of a mountain holding an
      eagle he’s shot.</p>
