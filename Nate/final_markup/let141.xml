    <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
    <body>
        <p> <good_health>Thanks for your letter of 17 February, which gave me not a little pleasure</good_health>, as I had
            been longing for it so very much. And I’m going ahead and writing again so soon, old
            chap, because I think of you so often and also long for you, and every morning the
            prints on the wall of my study remind me of you, Christus Consolator and pendant, that
            wood engraving after Van Goyen, Dordrecht, the portrait of the Rev. Heldring, The oven
            by T. Rousseau and so on, because I got them all from you, and so the pot called the
            kettle black when you wrote that it was so wrong of me to give you a print for your room
            now and then, if I find something that goes with what you already have. So enough about
            that, I say in turn, but write and tell me whether you’ve added some good thing or other
            to your collection, do continue with it, because the way you do it and set about it,
            it’s most certainly a good work. </p>
        <p> Yesterday evening at C.M.’s I saw a whole year of that magazine L’Art, of which you have
            the issue with the woodcuts after Corot. <unstress reason="environment">What especially struck me were woodcuts after
            drawings by Millet, including The leaffall (shepherd guarding his flock), The flock of
            crows, donkeys in a marsh (misty effect), The woodcutters, Housekeeper sweeping her
            house, Farmyard (nocturnal effect), also an etching after Corot, The dune,
            and after Breton, The feast of Saint John and others, by Chauvel, among others, and also
            one after Millet, The beans.</unstress> </p>
        <p> Was with Uncle Jan the whole afternoon and evening of Sunday, 17 Feb. at Uncle Cor’s,
            where Aunt Antje is staying these days. </p>
        <p> It was Anna’s birthday, and it was also a good day for me. Got up quite early and went
            in the morning to the French church, where a minister from the vicinity of Lyon was
            preaching, he’d come to collect money for an evangelical mission. His sermon consisted
            mainly of stories from the lives of factory workers there, and although he wasn’t
            especially eloquent as far as ease of expression goes, and though one even noticed how
            difficult it was for him and a little awkward, as it were, his words were moving
            nonetheless, because they came from the heart, and that alone has the power to make an
            impression on other hearts. Afterwards, at 1 o’clock, I had to be at a Sunday school
            given by an English minister, Adler, in Barndesteeg, he has a small but very respectable
            old church there. The school, though, was held in a small room where the light had to be
            lit even at that hour, i.e. in the middle of the day. There were perhaps some 20
            children from that poor neighbourhood. Although he’s a foreigner he nevertheless
            preaches in Dutch (though the English service), and also gives confirmation classes in
            Dutch, but very charmingly and capably. <work origin="existing" stage="finished">Had taken along the sketch of that map of the
            Holy Land that I’d made for Pa’s birthday </work>(with red chalk on heavy brown paper) and I
            gave it to him, because I thought that little room a nice place for it, and I’m glad
            it’s hanging on the wall there. </p>
        <p> Had met him at Mr Macfarlane’s, the minister of that little English church in the
            Begijnhof, where I had ventured to pay a visit. Was received with kindness and hope to
            go there again sometime.I then paid a visit on Sunday afternoon to Vos, who is but
            poorly and was lying in bed to rest a little, so I couldn’t see him. And then on to
            Uncle Stricker and after that to Uncle Cor. This morning I went back to see Vos, for I
            really wanted to see and speak to him myself. This time I found him up, but he doesn’t
            look at all well and Kee looked rather tired and pale too. </p>
        <p> Spent a long time there, they have a lot of worries, he brings up blood now and then and
            coughs a lot. Jan is staying at Uncle Stricker’s for a few days. </p>
        <p> Apart from visiting the English minister, I also ventured to pay a visit to the Rev.
            Gagnebin. Now that I’m really getting down to work and have thrown myself into the
            fight, it’s important to try to do it boldly and to set to work with relative
            forthrightness, even though there are still many obstacles to be overcome. By working
            and doing, one grows into the work and the doing of it, and perhaps the best way to
            acquire sufficient enthusiasm is to take the enthusiasm one has in oneself and to employ
            it and expend it and use it. </p>
        <p> The Rev. Gagnebin took it well and said that I should come back one evening, deciding on
            this evening, so I have to go there directly, and hope still to write and tell you how
            it was. Pa also advised me to try and make the acquaintance of a person or two. I did
            find it pleasant to speak French and English again; it’s a strange feeling if one hasn’t
            done it for a long time. Old boy, Dickens knew it, didn’t he, when he prayed, Lord keep
            my memory green yea evergreen. Amen. </p>
        <p> <work origin="existing" stage="middle">Twice I got up early in the morning to work on a sketch of the map of the journeys of
            Paul that I still had, making it more complete, so that now it looks good, with the
            names in French </work>even better than on the ones I made for Pa and for my study, with the
            idea of giving it to him, for if possible I wanted to highlight this visit, because he’s
            a clever man from whom I may get good advice later on, once he notices from one thing
            and another that I take it seriously. Also showed him the map of Brittany and Normandy
            and some French texts I have. </p>
        <p> Last week Nico Mager, who’s here in town, came to visit, and that pleased me. The
            contract he has with Mr Braat will expire in October or November, so he is free, but
            also compelled by necessity, to seek another position. He’s thinking of venturing abroad
            and had his eye on Geneva, where he’s been before, perhaps that isn’t such a bad plan
            after all. If now, meaning by October, there was a vacancy at Goupil’s, that would help
            him out immediately. He was planning to write to Uncle Cent again, around Uncle’s
            birthday on 28 March. I’ve seen that he can work well. He’s a nice chap, he asked me to
            send you his regards if I wrote. From him I also heard some news from Dordrecht. Lord
            keep my memory green. </p>
        <p> I took a walk with him as well. Also told him that I thought that a young man who knew
            what he knew – namely what one learns when one has worked diligently for some years in a
            bookshop or similar position – is almost sure to find, after a time of searching and
            difficulties in London or some other large English city, a position in which he could
            earn enough to support himself while also learning to speak good English. That once he
            had found something like that he could count on its being permanent, and that he would
            thus be secure, as it were, for a few years.One can profit a great deal, especially when
            one does more than the shop assistants there tend to do, and England certainly has an
            advantage over Paris in that one has a better chance of finding decent lodgings and a
            kind of home in middleclass surroundings, which is rather difficult in Paris. And I also
            told him to ‘hold fast to that which you have already’ and to go forth and see with your
            own eyes, because having been in a bookshop for so long and having worked there
            faithfully, as he has done, is an asset. </p>
        <p> You must write again soon, and as soon as you know when you’ll be making the trip, I’ll
            no doubt hear it, and I sincerely hope that when you’re here we’ll be able to spend some
            time together and that you won’t be too busy. </p>
        <p> Was just at the Rev. Gagnebin’s, but was told he was too busy to receive me (and yet
            he’d stipulated this hour and this day). I heard music in the house, so apparently
            something or other was going on. I left what I’d made for him and asked for it to be
            given to him. </p>
        <p> <stress reason="career">I feel the need to do something like that now and then, for it’s most certainly in doubt
            whether I’ll pass, i.e. all of the requirements, 5 years at the least is a long time, if
            one begins younger then one succeeds much more easily. </stress>Though I can work more and am
            better able to keep clear from distractions, and I have no desire for those things which
            many another craves, even so, I notice that I have difficulty learning. And in case I
            don’t pass, I want nevertheless to be sure of having left a sign of life here and there. </p>
        <p> <stress reason="career">It’s an amazing amount that one has to know, and even though they try to reassure me, it
            constantly gives me an indescribably strong feeling of fear, and there’s nothing for it
            but to get back to work again, for it has been clearly shown that I must do it, no
            matter what the cost.</stress> Onwards, then, because standing still or going downhill are things
            I’d rather not think about. If one did that, one would make things even more difficult
            and become confused, and actually end up having to start all over from the beginning. </p>
        <p> It’s already rather late and I’m really quite tired, for I’ve also walked a lot today.
            What would it be like at Vos’s? At night he probably often has a bad time of it, what
            with coughing and bringing up blood. </p>
        <p> A good letter from home, fortunately it appears that the journey agreed with Pa. I’m
            longing to hear how Anna’s birthday was, in all likelihood she’ll celebrate her next one
            in her own house. </p>
        <p> I wish you the very best and blessings on your work and everything you do, write again
            soon if you can. Give my regards to everyone at the Rooses’, and accept in thought a
            hearty handshake. Goodnight, and believe me </p>

        <p>Tuesday morning. Apropos. Have you sent those maps to Gladwell, i.e. to London? Haven’t
            heard from him lately, and should like to know how he is and what his plans are. It’s
            wonderful weather this morning, must go to Mendes in a little while.</p>
