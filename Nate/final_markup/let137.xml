  <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
  <body>
    <p> I feel the need to write to you without waiting too long, the reason being first of all that
      I must thank you for three things. <good_health>First of all, for your excellent fourpage letter, with
      which you gave me the greatest pleasure</good_health>, because it does one good to feel that a brother of
      his also walks and lives on earth, <stress reason="career">when one has a lot of things to think about and a lot to
      do, one sometimes gets the feeling, where am I? what am I doing? where am I going?</stress> — and one
      starts to grow dizzy — but then such a familiar voice, or rather familiar handwriting, makes
      one feel firm ground beneath one’s feet again, as it were. </p>
    <p> T<good_health>hen I must thank you for an issue of the Galerie Contemporaine about E. Frère. It’s very
      interesting and I’m happy to have something by him.</good_health> And I also thank you for the 10 postage
      stamps, it really is too much and you shouldn’t have done so much. A hearty handshake for
      everything. </p>
    <p> Now I have a few things to tell you about St Nicholas; I received a good letter from Etten
      with a money order for a pair of gloves enclosed. </p>
    <p> I already had some, however, so I bought something else with the money, namely another map
      by Stieler, namely Scotland alone. At present I can get them singly at Seyffardt’s, but there
      probably won’t always be that opportunity. I’ve drawn that map and so have it double, and
      because I did want to give Harry Gladwell a Christmas present I hope to send it to you for
      him, to enclose when a crate goes to Paris. one must build one’s house upon a rock, Scotland,
      Normandy and Brittany are really rather rocky, just take a look at that large map of Scotland
      when you get it. If I compare the work of studying to the building of a house, and these
      months to its foundation, then rocks accordingly lie at its base. </p>
    <p> But all of this by the by, now more about the evening in question. From Uncle Cor I received
      Bossuet, Or<good_health>aisons funèbres, in a very good and handy edition, very complete, it includes,
      among other things, the fine sermon about Paul on the text ‘for when I am weak, then am I
      strong’. It’s a noble book, you’ll see it at Christmas, I was so happy with it that until
      today I’ve been carrying it around in my pocket,</good_health> though it’s time I stopped that because
      something might happen to it. From Mendes I received the works of Claudius, also a good, solid
      book; I had sent him Thomae Kempensis de imitatione Christi and written in the front, There is
      neither Jew nor Greek in Him, neither bond nor free, neither male nor female: but Christ is
      all, and in all. From Uncle Stricker a box of cigars, you know what I did with them, they’re
      always so friendly at the Rooses’ and I’d already been wondering if I had anything to send
      when that box of cigars arrived as a godsend. And in the evening I found a letter from Uncle
      Jan lying on my table. Was then briefly at Vos and Kee’s, where Uncle and Aunt Stricker were
      as well, but couldn’t stay because I had a lesson from 810 with Teixeira. Uncle Jan spent the
      evening at Uncle Cor’s.Was at Uncle Stricker’s service this morning, i.e. in the Eilandskerk,
      Uncle Cor was there too. The text was ‘by Thy light shall we see light’. It’s always a nice
      walk to that Eilandskerk. This afternoon I took another walk around the little English church
      with those maps of those rocky countries, because I had a feeling that they were connected
      with that little church. </p>
    <p> ‘The Church of God stands on a rock’, those words were in this morning’s hymn, and that’s
      how Ruisdael painted it too, and Millet in the painting in the Luxembourg. </p>
    <p> It’s a good plan of yours to write those names etc. on the map of Brittany. Bring it along
      at Christmas, you know that I did that on the one I drew, then we can compare them. Be sure
      and do it, for that is good. </p>
    <p> You talk about my coming to The Hague again on my way to Etten, I should really like to,
      would it be possible to stay a night at the Rooses’? If so, then you do not have to write,
      then I’ll count on it being possible if necessary. I should like to see your room again and
      the tree with ivy, I hope that will be possible and that I can leave here early enough. </p>
    <p> I can’t tell you how much I long for Christmas. And may Pa be satisfied with what I’ve done. </p>
    <p><unstress reason="environment"> It was such wonderful weather today, and so beautiful among those thornhedges by the little
      church when night began to fall.</unstress> </p>
    <p> Had a talk with Mendes this week, or rather last week, about ‘He who hate not, even his own
      life also, he cannot be my disciple’. He declared that expression too strong, but I maintained
      that it was the simple truth, and doesn’t Thomas a Kempis say it when he talks about knowing
      oneself and despising oneself? </p>
    <p> <bad_health>If we look at others who have done more and are better than we are, then soon enough we come
      to hate our own life because it’s not as good as that of others.</bad_health> Just look at a man like
      Thomas a Kempis, constrained by the love of Christ to write that little book, sincere and
      simple and true as few others were, either before or since. Or in another sphere, just take a
      look at the work of a Millet or that of a Stieler or The large oaks by Jules Dupré. They did
      it: ‘let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your
      Father which is in heaven’, and Pa is such a man too; and however much we can do, you see, the
      best thing is to keep our sights on such people and to seek whether we too may perhaps find
      something. And to believe that it’s true what Pa said, that if someone asks ‘Lord, I should so
      much like to be earnest’, that it will be heard and granted by God. </p>
    <p> Have a good Sunday today, how I’d like to be with you, Uncle Jan has gone to Haarlem so I’m
      alone this evening, but still have to do as much as I possibly can. You have really given me
      such pleasure with that magazine on E. Frère. I once saw him myself at Goupil’s, he has
      something very unpretentious about him. ‘At last, he triumphed’ it says in his biography, may
      it be so with us one day — that can happen and it is good to say: I never despair. </p>
    <p> A person doesn’t get it all at once, and most of those who have become something very good
      have gone through a long, difficult period of preparation that was the rock upon which their
      house was founded. </p>
    <p> Man is depraved by nature, at best a thief — but — with God’s guidance and blessing he can
      become something of higher worth, as there came for Paul a day on which he could say with
      frankness and trust to Herod, I would to God, that not only thou, but also all that hear me
      this day, were such as I am, except these bonds. </p>
    <p> Thanks for what you write about the lithographs. Something else — <good_health>you also sent 2 pairs of
      Christus Consolator and pendant, I was very glad to get them.</good_health> It could do no harm if you also
      had that map of Scotland, then you would have three things from that atlas, and the proverb
      says: all good things come in threes. So count on getting that one too, and by no means buy it
      yourself, had first wanted to send you this one that is now going to Gladwell, but I consider
      it my duty to let him hear from me now and again. I hope he’ll be able to go to Lewisham at
      Christmas. You know that painting by Cuyp in the museum here, an old Dutch family, when he saw
      that he stood looking at it for a long time and then spoke of ‘the house built on the rock’
      and of his home in Lewisham. I, too, have memories of his father’s house and will not easily
      forget it. Much and strong and great love lives there under that roof, and its fire is in him
      still, it is not dead, but sleepeth. </p>
    <p> <stress reason ="career">Now I have to hurry, for I have to get to work.</stress> So in all likelihood I’ll be coming to The
      Hague next week for a day, Thursday say, possibly later, I have to see how it fits in best
      with my work. From The Hague I hope to go to Dordrecht, and if it turns out that you can leave
      Saturday evening, we’ll meet each other at the station in Dordrecht. </p>
    <p> In that case I would even spend two nights at the Rooses’, if I’m going to The Hague anyway,
      it can’t hurt to stay a bit longer and call on some people. </p>
    <p> A pity, in a way, that Mauve is going to move, I hope that we’ll go there again together,
      like that evening last spring, it was really pleasant then. </p>
    <p> Now make sure they don’t go to any trouble at the Rooses’. If I can’t stay there you’ll know
      it without asking them and can write to me, and I’ll take it into account; if I can, tell them
      only the day before. </p>
    <p> I wish you the very best and blessings in your work. You’ll be busy, but actually one should
      be grateful for pressure and effort and all suchlike things more than for anything else, for
      it is only by long training in that that one develops. I sincerely hope that you’ll be able to
      leave Saturday, because at home they’d surely like us to be in Etten the Sunday before
      Christmas. So goodbye for now, if I hear nothing more from you I’ll come on Thursday or
      Friday, 20 or 21 December. </p>
    <p> I finally decided to hang up that page again from Bargue’s Cours de dessin, Anne of
      Brittany, yes, man is depraved by nature and at best a thief, but in the battle of life he can
      become a being of higher worth; a being of higher worth, those words sprang to mind when I had
      been looking for a long time at the expression on the face of that beautiful woman Anne of
      Brittany, the expression which explains why she also recalls the words ‘one of Sorrows and
      acquainted with grief; sorrowful yet always rejoicing’. </p>
    <p>Adieu, give my regards to your housemates, and believe me</p>
