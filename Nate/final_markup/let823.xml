    <salutation>My dear Theo, </salutation>
    <body>
        <p><unstress reason="family">I have to thank you very much for a consignment of colours, which was also accompanied by
            an excellent woollen waistcoat.</unstress> How kind you are to me, and how I’d like to be able to
            do something good in order to prove to you that I’d like to be less ungrateful. Your
            colours reached me at the right moment, for what I brought back from Arles is almost
            exhausted. The thing is, I’ve been working this month in the olive groves, for they’d
            driven me mad with their Christs in the garden, in which nothing is observed. Of course
            there’s no question of me doing anything from the Bible – and I’ve written to Bernard,
            and also to Gauguin, that I believed that thinking and not dreaming was our duty, that I
            was therefore astonished when looking at their work by the fact that they give way to
            that. For Bernard has sent me photos of his canvases. The thing about them is that
            they’re sorts of dreams and nightmares, that there’s some erudition there – one can see
            that it’s someone who’s mad about the primitives – but frankly the English
            PreRaphaelites did this much better, and then Puvis and Delacroix are much healthier
            than those PreRaphaelites. So this doesn’t leave me cold, but it gives me an
            uncomfortable feeling of a tumble rather than progress. Well, to shake this off, I’ve
            been messing about in the groves morning and evening on these bright and cold days, but
            in very beautiful, clear sunshine, and the result is 5 no. 30 canvases which, with the 3
            studies of olive trees that you have, at least constitute an attack on the problem. The
            olive tree is variable like our willow or pollard in the north. <work origin="new" stage="middle">You know that willows
            are very picturesque, despite the fact that it appears monotonous, it’s the tree typical
            of the country. Now what the willow is in our native country, the olive tree and the
            cypress have exactly the same importance here. What I’ve done is a rather harsh and
            coarse realism beside their abstractions, but it will nevertheless impart the rustic
            note, and will smell of the soil.</work> How I’d like to see the studies from nature by Gauguin
            and Bernard, the latter tells me of portraits which doubtless would please me more. <work stage="planned" origin="new">I
            hope I’ll get used to working in the cold – in the morning there are very interesting
            effects of white frost and fog, and I still have the great desire to do for the
            mountains and for the cypresses what I’ve just done for the olive trees, have a really
            good go at them.</work></p>
        <p>The thing is, the olive tree and the cypress have rarely been painted, and from the point
            of view of placing the paintings this ought to go to England, I know well enough what
            they’re looking for over there. Whatever the case, I’m almost sure that in this way I’ll
            do something passable from time to time. As I said to Isaäcson, it’s really more and
            more my opinion that by working assiduously from nature, without saying to oneself in
            advance, I want to do this or that, by working as if one were making shoes, without
            artistic preoccupations, one won’t always do well, but on the days when one thinks about
            it the least one finds a subject that holds its own with the work of those who came
            before us. <stress reason="career">One learns to know a country that’s basically quite different from what it
            appears at first sight. On the contrary, one will say to oneself, I want to finish my
            paintings better, I want to do them with care; in the face of the difficulties of the
            weather, of changing effects, a heap of ideas like this finds itself reduced to being
            impracticable, and I end up resigning myself by saying, it’s experience and each day’s
            little bit of work alone that in the long run matures and enables one to do things that
            are more complete or more right. </stress>So slow, long work is the only road, and all ambition
            to be set on doing well, false. For one must spoil as many canvases as one succeeds with
            when one mounts the breach each morning. To paint, the tranquil, regulated life would
            therefore be absolutely necessary, and at present what can one do when one sees that
            Bernard, for example, is always put under pressure, pressure, pressure by his parents.
            He can’t do as he wants, and many others with him. One says to oneself, I shan’t paint
            any more, but what will one do then? <stress reason="money">Ah – a more expeditious painting process should be
            invented, less expensive than oil and yet durable.</stress> A painting... it will end up becoming
            as commonplace as a sermon, a painter like someone who’s a century behind the times.
            It’s a shame, though, that it should be so. Now if the painters had better understood
            Millet as a man – now some like Lhermitte and Roll have grasped him – things wouldn’t be
            so. One must work as hard and with as few pretensions as a peasant if one wants to last.
            And instead of putting on grandiose exhibitions, it would have been better to address
            oneself to the common people, and work so that everyone may have paintings or
            reproductions at home, which are lessons like the work of Millet.</p>
        <p><stress reason="money">I’m completely at the end of my canvas, and when you can please send me 10 metres.</stress> <work origin="new" stage="planned">Then
            I’m going to attack the cypresses and the mountains.</work> I think that this must be the
            centre of the work I’ve done here and there in Provence, and then we can conclude the
            stay here when it’s convenient. Which isn’t urgent, for Paris only distracts, after all.
            I don’t know, though, not always being a pessimist – <work stage="planned" origin="new">I keep telling myself that I still
            have it in my heart to paint a bookshop one day with the shop window yellowpink, in the
            evening, and the passersby black – it’s such an essentially modern subject</work>. Because it
            also appears such a figurative source of light. I say, that would be a subject that
            would look good between an olive grove and a wheatfield, the sowing of books, of prints.
            I have that very much in my heart to do, like a light in the darkness. Yes, there’s a
            way of seeing Paris as beautiful. But anyway, bookshops aren’t hares, and there’s no
            hurry, and I have a good will to work here for another year, which will probably be
            wiser.</p>
        <p>Mother must have been in Leiden for a good fortnight by now.</p>
        <p>I’ve delayed sending you the canvases for them because<work origin="new" stage="finished"> I’ll include them with the canvas
            of the wheatfield for the Vingtistes</work>.</p>
        <p>Warm regards to Jo, she’s very good, continuing to be well. Thank you once again for the
            colours and for the woollen waistcoat, and good handshake in thought.</p>
