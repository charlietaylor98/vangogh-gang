  <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
  <body>
    <p> Thanks for your last letter, I heard from home that you’ve already been to Mauve’s, that was
      undoubtedly a good day, I’ll certainly hear about it sometime, when the opportunity arises.
      Herewith a contribution for your collection, namely three lithographs after Bosboom and two by
      J. Weissenbruch, found them this morning at a Jewish bookseller’s. Is that one after Bosboom
      the church in Scheveningen? The other is the Grote Kerk in Breda, the third after his painting
      that was at the large exhibition in Paris. <good_health>Those two after Weissenbruch moved me</good_health> – perhaps you
      already have them, but then again possibly not. Do go on collecting such prints, and books
      too. </p>
    <p> I’m now collecting Latin and Greek themes and all kinds of writings on history and so on. <work origin="new" stage="middle">Am
      working on one on the Reformation that’s getting rather long. </work></p>
    <p> <stress reason="career">Recently spoke to a young man who had just done his entrance examination for the Leiden
      college with a good result – it isn’t easy, he told me what they asked him, but I do keep up
      my courage, and with God’s help I’ll pass them,</stress> and the following examinations as well. Mendes
      has given me every reason to believe that at the end of three months we’ll be as far as he
      imagined we would be if everything went well. Still, Greek lessons in the heart of Amsterdam,
      in the heart of the Jewish quarter on a very warm and oppressive summer afternoon, with the
      feeling hanging over me that many difficult examinations will have to be taken, set by very
      learned and cunning professors, are rather more oppressive than a walk on the beach or in the
      Brabant wheatfields, which will certainly be beautiful now, on a day like that. But we must
      ‘strive on’ through everything, as Uncle Jan says. </p>
    <p> A couple of days ago a couple of children fell into the water near the Kattenburg bridge.
      Uncle saw it and commandeered the sloop of the Makasser that is in dock here. A little boy was
      pulled out; I went along with two ship’s doctors whom Uncle had sent over, and the men
      carrying the boy into a chemist’s shop made every effort to resuscitate the child, but to no
      avail. In the meantime it was recognized by the father, who’s a stoker at the dockyard, and
      the little body was taken home in a woollen blanket. The search went on for an hour and a
      half, as it was thought that a girl had fallen in as well, though happily that seems not to be
      the case. In the evening I went back to see the people, it was then already dark in the house,
      the little body lay so still on a bed in a side room, he was such a sweet little boy. <bad_health>There
      was great sorrow, that child was the light of that house, as it were, and that light had now
      been put out. Even though coarse people express their grief in a coarse way and without
      dignity, as the mother did, among others, still, one feels a great deal in such a house of
      mourning, and the impression stayed with me the whole evening when I took a walk.</bad_health> </p>
    <p> <unstress reason="environment">Last Sunday morning I made a nice excursion, namely first to the early sermon, the Rev.
      Posthumus Meijjes in the Noorderkerk, then to Bickerseiland, where I walked on the dyke along
      the IJ until it was time for church again, and then to the Eilandskerk where Uncle Stricker
      preached.</unstress> Thus the time passes, and quickly too, already we’re almost at the end of the week
      again.How are you, old chap? So very often, daily, do I think of you. </p>
    <p> God help us, struggling, to stay on top, it is good that you associate with good artists; I,
      too, still cling to the memory of many of them. Overcome evil with good, it is written, and
      one can seek to do it – and to this end God can help and make our days bearable with much good
      in the meantime, and preserve us from too much selfreproach. </p>
    <p> When Uncle Jan commandeered the sloop and the doctors to go and help on the afternoon that
      accident happened, I saw him in his element. </p>
    <p> Now I must get to work, though I still have to fill this page. Anna is in Leiden, as you
      surely know, and will come here one of these days with our future brotherinlaw, am looking
      forward to seeing them very much, Pa wrote so cheerfully about last Sunday when they were in
      Etten and everything was good in his eyes, and they see rightly, <good_health>so let us view what has
      happened to our sister as a blessing on our house, in which we all share; if one member be
      glad, let all the members be glad with her.</good_health> </p>
    <p> Next week, or perhaps even tomorrow, Uncle and Aunt Pompe are coming to stay here, and also
      Fanny and Bet ’s Graeuwen, it’s been a long time since I’ve seen any of them. </p>
    <p> Am quite often up rather early in the morning, and when the sun rises over the yard and the
      workers come a while later it’s a wonderful sight from the window, and I should wish to have
      you here. <work origin="new" stage="planned">Will I later be working on such a morning on a sermon on ‘He maketh His sun to rise
      on the evil and on the good’, or on ‘Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and
      Christ shall give thee light’, or on ‘It is a good thing to praise the Lord in the morning’
      and ‘It is a pleasant thing for the eyes to behold the sun’</work> – I hope so. </p>
    <p> All the same, <unstress reason="environment">it seems that the sun never shines so beautifully as it does in a parsonage or
      in a church. It’s wonderful to work on ‘the writings’ early in the morning.</unstress> </p>
    <p>If you have the time and a stamp and paper, then write again soon. Uncle Jan sends you his
      regards, that evening you described there in the dunes must have been pleasant. <unstress reason="environment">In Uncle Cor’s
      shop I recently saw The Gospels by Bida, how beautiful it is, </unstress>how wonderful it must be to be a
      Christian labourer like that, but it’s impossible to put into words how beautiful it is,
      that’s it again, there is much in that work that reminds one of Rembrandt. And now a handshake
      in thought, and I sincerely wish you the best, and believe me ever</p>
