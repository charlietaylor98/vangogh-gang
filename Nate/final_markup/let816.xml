      <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
      <body>
            <p>Enclosed I’m sending you a list of colours I need as soon as possible.</p>
            <p><good_health>You gave me very great pleasure by sending me those Millets</good_health>,<work origin="new" stage="middle"> I’m working on them
                  zealously.</work> I was growing flabby by dint of never seeing anything artistic, and
                  this revives me. <work stage="finished" origin="existing">I’ve finished The evening</work> and <work origin="new" stage="middle">am working on The diggers and the
                  man who’s putting his jacket on, no. 30 canvases, and The sower, smaller.</work> The
                  evening is in a range of violets and soft lilacs, with light from the lamp pale
                  citron, then the orange glow of the fire and the man in red ochre. You will see
                  it. It seems to me that doing painting after these Millet drawings is much rather
                  to translate them into another language than to copy them. Apart from that I have
                  a rain effect on the go, and an evening effect with tall pines. And also a
                  leaffall.</p>
            <p><good_health>My health is very good</good_health> – <bad_health>except often a lot of melancholy however</bad_health> – <unstress reason="environment">but I feel much
                  much better than when I came here, and even better than in Paris.</unstress><unstress reason="career"> Also, as for the
                  work the ideas are becoming firmer, it seems to me.</unstress> But then I don’t quite know if
                  you’d like what I’m doing now. For despite what you say in your previous letter,
                  that the search for style often harms other qualities, the fact is that I feel
                  myself greatly driven to seek style, if you like, but I mean by that a more manly
                  and more deliberate drawing. If that will make me more like Bernard or Gauguin, I
                  can’t do anything about it. But am inclined to believe that in the long run you’d
                  get used to it. For yes, one must feel the wholeness of a country – isn’t that
                  what distinguishes a Cézanne from something else. And Guillaumin, whom you
                  mention, he has so much style and a personal way of drawing. Anyway, I’ll do as I
                  can.</p>
            <p>Now that most of the leaves have fallen the landscape looks more like the north, and
                  then I really feel that if I went back to the north I would see it more clearly
                  than before.</p>
            <p>Health is a big thing, and a lot depends on it, as regards work too.</p>
            <p><good_health>Fortunately those abominable nightmares no longer torment me.</good_health></p>
            <p>I hope to go to Arles in the next few days.</p>
            <p>I’d very much like Jo to see The evening, I think that I’ll send you a consignment
                  shortly, but it’s drying very badly because of the dampness of the studio. Here
                  the houses have scarcely any cellar or foundations, and one feels the damp more
                  than in the north.</p>
            <p>At home they’ll have moved by now, I’ll add 6 canvases for them to the next
                  consignment. Is it necessary to have them framed, perhaps not, for it isn’t worth
                  it. Above all, don’t frame the studies I send you from time to time, that can be
                  done later, pointless for them to take up too much room. <work stage="finished" origin="new">I’ve also done a canvas
                  for Mr Peyron, a view of the house with a tall pine tree.</work></p>
            <p>I hope that your health and Jo’s continue to be good.</p>
            <p><unstress reason="family">I’m so happy that you’re no longer alone, and that everything’s more normal than
                  before.</unstress></p>
            <p>Is Gauguin back, and what’s Bernard doing?</p>
            <p>More soon, I shake your hand firmly, and Jo’s, and our friends’, and believe me</p>
      </body>
      <close>Ever yours,</close>
      <sig>Vincent</sig>
      <ps>
            <p>I’m trying to simplify the list of colours as much as possible – thus I very often
                  use the ochres as in the old days. </p>
            <p> I know very well that the studies drawn with long, sinuous lines from the last
                  consignment weren’t what they ought to become, however I dare urge you to believe
                  that in landscapes one will continue to mass things by means of a drawing style
                  that seeks to express the entanglement of the masses. Thus, do you remember
                  Delacroix’s landscape, Jacob’s struggle with the angel? And there are others of
                  his! For example the cliffs, and the very flowers you speak of sometimes. Bernard
                  really has found perfect things in there. Anyway, don’t be too swift to adopt a
                  prejudice against it. </p>
            <p> <work origin="new" stage="middle">Anyway, you’ll see that there’s already more character in a large landscape with
                  pines, red ochre trunks defined by a black line than in the previous ones.</work></p>
      </ps>
