      <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
      <p>Your letter and the contents were truly welcome, many thanks for them. <good_health>And I
      was pleased</good_health> to see that you were taking things calmly, and indeed I had expected nothing else.
      I mean as regards the objections raised. <work origin="existing" stage="middle">Well, since I last wrote I’ve slaved away at that
      drawing of the dung-heap.</work> It’s a splendid sight. The first drawing of it has already undergone
      so many changes — now white here, then black again at various places — that I transferred it
      to a second paper because the first was too worn. And am now working again on that. I have to
      get up early in the morning, for that’s when I see the effects I want. If only I could get it
      as I have it in my mind. Well, the second is the same size as the two earlier ones of the
      peat-cutting and the sand quarry, and can go in the frame. There is effect in it at the
      moment, but I fear I’ll spoil it again. But one mustn’t be afraid of that, otherwise one will
      never get anywhere. <work origin="new" stage="finished">And in the meantime I’ve also done a large study of a woman sewing.</work> But
      I’ve had a disappointment with the Orphanage in that I have not been given permission to draw
      there — there were, they said, no precedents of that kind and, furthermore, they were going to
      clean and lay new floors in the wards. Well, it’s not too bad for there are other orphanages,
      it’s just that in this one I know a man who has modelled for me regularly, and that would have
      made it easier for me to do sketches.</p>
      Last winter I saw the old men’s home at Voorburg.
      Smaller, of course, but almost more typical. On that day, it was near evening, the old boys
      were sitting on benches and chairs around an old cannon stove, very real. Perhaps I’ll try
      that one in Voorburg now I can’t do it here. Also went to Scheveningen for a day and saw a
      fine sight of fellows there with a cart full of nets that had been tanned and spread out on
      the dunes. <work origin="new" stage="planned">I’ll definitely tackle that or the nets being mended in a large drawing sometime.</work>
      It certainly is an improvement, Theo, that I had those stretching frames and frame made for
      charcoal drawings or whatever it may be, for working with them is a pleasure. What you say
      about spending too much time with painters being not good but some time being all right is
      true, I believe. And for that reason, too, I’m glad Van der Weele comes to call. Yes, one
      sometimes feels a longing to discuss it with people in the know. And especially when one works
      and searches in the same spirit, one can give each other great strength and stimulus, and one
      isn’t easily discouraged.One can’t always live outside the fatherland, and the fatherland
      isn’t just nature; to that must be added human hearts that seek and feel the same. It’s only
      then that the fatherland is complete and one feels at home. This is now the composition of the
      dung-heap. I don’t know how much sense you can make of it. In the front women emptying
      dustbins, behind them the sheds where the dung is stored, and the fellows at work with
      wheelbarrows &amp;c. The first one I did was a little different: there were two other fellows
      in the foreground with sou’westers, which they often wear in bad weather, and the group of
      women was more in the dark. Yet that light effect really is there, since the light falls from
      above between the sheds onto the figures that are on the paths. It would be a splendid sight
      to paint. I think you understand all about it, I wish I could talk to Mauve about it. But
      perhaps it’s even better not to. For getting advice from another person doesn’t always help
      someone to make progress, however clever the person may be, and the cleverest aren’t always
      clever when it comes to explaining something clearly. Again, I don’t know myself what is
      desirable. For the present, painting is far from being my main goal, and perhaps I’d get it
      ready for an illustrated magazine quicker on my own than if someone who would never consider
      illustrated magazines gave me advice. I get on with Rappard best of all. Adieu, old chap, best
      wishes in everything and thanks for the timely dispatch.Ever yours, Vincent </letter>
