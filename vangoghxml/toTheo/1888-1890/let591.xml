<letter><salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
      <p>Thanks for your letter and for the 50franc note enclosed in it. I would have things to
            write to you at leisure <stress reason = "environment"> but have to do so in great haste</stress>. First of all, Tersteeg once
            again. Am very pleased that your consignment goes off on Monday and after all, perhaps
            also because there’s a canvas of mine in it. However, that one doesn’t count, because I
            hope you’ll think what I’ve just done is good and that it will mean <work origin = "new"> a new canvas of mine</work>
            goes off to Holland. I’d worked on <work origin = "exisiting">a no. 20 canvas</work> in the open air in an orchard —
            ploughed lilac field, a reed fence — two pink peach trees against a glorious blue and
            white sky. Probably the best landscape I’ve done. Just as I brought it home I received
            from our sister a piece in Dutch dedicated to Mauve’s memory, with his portrait (really
            good, the portrait), the text poor and saying nothing — pretty etching. But something or
            other grabbed hold of me and made my throat tight with emotion, and I wrote on my
            painting Souvenir de Mauve Vincent &amp; Theo and if you think it’s good as it stands
            we’ll send it to Mrs Mauve in both our names. I deliberately took the best study I’ve
            made here, I don’t know what they’ll say about it back home, but that’s neither here nor
            there to us. It seemed to me that in memory of Mauve we needed something that was both
            tender and very cheerful and not a study in a more serious key than that. </p>
      <p>‘Don’t believe that the dead are dead. While there are people still alive The dead will
            live, the dead will live’.</p>
      <p><stress reason = "environment">That’s how I feel the thing</stress>, no sadder than that. In addition to that I now have another 4
            or 5 studies of orchards and I’m going to start <work origin = "new">a no. 30 canvas</work> of the same subject.</p>
      <p>This zinc white that I’m using now doesn’t dry. If everything was dry I’d send a
            consignment at once. Only the days are all good now, not in terms of the weather, on the
            contrary, there are 3 windy days for one still one, but as for the subjects of orchards
            in blossom. I have a lot of trouble painting because of the wind, but I fix my easel to
            pegs stuck in the ground and work anyway, it’s too beautiful. Now be steadfast in
            keeping up relations with Tersteeg. Success or not, in a year I’m inclined to believe it
            will be there. It seems to me that Tersteeg and not Reid should now set up the
            Impressionist exhibition in England.</p>
      <p>I don’t at all like Reid’s way of behaving towards us, it seems funny to me that you and
            Guillaumin haven’t already arranged to cancel the sale of the painting in question. You
            can tell Guillaumin boldly from me that that’s my firm opinion, and as much in the
            interests of G. himself as in the interests of business in general. The price was
            already derisory. Either Reid, after what has happened, should buy outright, or the
            artists should shut the door in his face. That’s how I’ve seen it in the past, and on
            further reflection I still see it like that. For 300 francs we’re compromising further
            sales, <stress reason = "money">but it’s very sad</stress>. Is there any way for you to buy it for us, the painting in
            question? Tersteeg should know all about the Reid business, and know he has a competitor
            in the England business and that we’d prefer him to be the one who does it. Anyway,
            that’s not my affair, it’s that of the firm of Boussod Valadon, to which you belong, you
            and Tersteeg. In great haste.</p> <close>Ever yours,</close> <sig>Vincent Warm regards to Koning, and till
      tomorrow I hope, if I have time to write.</sig></letter>
