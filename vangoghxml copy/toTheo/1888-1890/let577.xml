<letter><salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
    <p>During the journey I thought at least as much about you as about the new country I was
        seeing. But I tell myself that you’ll perhaps come here often yourself later on. It seems to
        me almost impossible to be able to work in Paris, unless you have a refuge in which to
        recover and regain your peace of mind and selfcomposure. Without that, you’d be <stress reason = "environment">bound to get
        utterly numbed.</stress></p>
    <p>Now I’ll tell you that for a start, there’s been a snowfall of at least 60 centimetres all
        over, and it’s still snowing. Arles doesn’t seem any bigger than Breda or Mons to me. </p>
    Before reaching Tarascon I noticed some <unstress reason = "environment">magnificent scenery </unstress>— huge yellow rocks, oddly jumbled
    together, with the most imposing shapes. <p>In the small valleys between these rocks there were
        rows of little round trees with olivegreen or greygreen foliage, which could well be lemon
        trees. But here in Arles the land seems flat. I noticed some magnificent plots of red earth
        planted with vines, with mountains in the background of the most delicate lilac. And the
        landscape under the snow with the white peaks against a sky as bright as the snow was just
        like the winter landscapes the Japanese did. Here’s my address</p>
    <p>Restaurant Carrel 30 rue Cavalerie Arles</p>
    <p>So far I’ve taken no more than a little walk round the town, as I was more or less completely
        done in last night. I’ll write to you soon — an antique dealer whose shop I went into
        yesterday in this very street was telling me he knew of a Monticelli. With a good handshake
        to you and the pals.</p>
    <close>Yours truly, </close><sig>Vincent</sig>
