                    <h2>General</h2>
                    <p>Our research was focused on whether van Gogh's productivity was truly due to
                        his suffering, or if his best work was instead borne of his periods of good
                        health. While we can't assume to know when van Gogh was at his most inspired
                        and why, our research shows that some of his most productive years coincide
                        with his self-described best years, which brings his well-known status of a
                        "tortured artist" into question. Despite this, our team also noticed a
                        correlation between van Gogh's stress and his productivity, suggesting that
                        his work output increased when he was under higher amounts of stress. </p>

                    <h2>Good Health vs. Bad Health</h2>
                    <p>After marking van Gogh's mentions of good and bad health, we organized them
                        by year in direct comparison with one another. We found that van Gogh's most
                        productive year was 1889, during which his mentions of good and bad health
                        are equal. In his second most productive year, 1888, his mentions of good
                        health are significantly higher than his mentions of bad health. During
                        these two years, van Gogh produced around 200 works of art, and by his own
                        word experienced good health more than bad. Furthermore, in 1886, van Gogh
                        experienced one of his least productive years since starting his career as
                        an artist. This year is also where we see the highest disparity between his
                        mentions of good and bad health, with zero mentions of good health and
                        twelve mentions of bad. We can conclude, then, that there is a slight
                        correlation between van Gogh's good health and his productivity.</p>

                    <h2>Other stressors</h2>
                    <p>Because we limited the use of good or bad health to when van Gogh directly
                        referred to himself, there were other mentions of stress and happiness
                        worthy of tagging, but in need of different descriptors. For these mentions,
                        we noted van Gogh's most common reasons for stress and marked them as such.
                        Most often, van Gogh experienced his highest levels of stress due to lack of
                        money, his perceived failings as a painter, and family-induced stress.
                        During these periods, he showed an uptick in productivity, likely due to an
                        effort to sell more paintings. As van Gogh got more stressed about his
                        career and finances, the number of pieces he mentioned in his letters to
                        Theo increased. van Gogh lived under a consistent stress of proving the
                        worth of his work to both the public and his family, and in this case, we
                        believe said stress led to an uptick in productivity. </p>

                    <h2>Environment</h2>
                    <p>While there is certainly a correlation between van Gogh's financial stress
                        and his productivity, the most telling correlation between van Gogh's
                        paintings and his life is the "environment" category we used to define
                        stress. Oftentimes during our research, van Gogh would refer to his
                        surroundings as a source of either stress or the lack of it, which we
                        labelled as "unstress." We equated the more general mentions of his stress
                        and unstress to his general environment, and it is here where we found some
                        of the most obvious connections between van Gogh's productivity and his
                        mental health. 1889, 1888, 1882 and 1883, van Gogh's most prodctive years,
                        all have significant differences between mentions of stress and unstress due
                        to his environment. In each year of productivity, van Gogh is much more
                        content with his surroundings than otherwise, with 1883 showing 30 mentions
                        of unstressed versus only five mentions of his being stressed. For each most
                        productive year there is a disparity like this, which suggests that the
                        happier van Gogh was with his environment, the more productive he was.</p>

                    <h2>Location</h2>
                    <p>Because van Gogh's environment was so important to both his well-being and
                        his productivity, we organized our markup information by location as well as
                        by year. van Gogh moved very often during his life, and we noticed
                        significant differences in both his mental health and the amount of work he
                        produced based on where he was living at the time. When looking at van
                        Gogh's good and bad health by location, the results aren't particularly
                        conclusive. The connections between <em>good</em> health and high levels of
                        productivity are more or less equal with his mentions of <em>bad</em> health
                        and high levels of productivity. However, when looking at his mentions of
                        environmental stress and unstress in correlation with his location, we again
                        find that his productivity increased when he found happiness in where he was
                        living. Many times, Vincent would describe beautiful scenery to Theo in his
                        letters. Most times, when he was delighted with the environment around him,
                        he would find the inspiration to paint. </p>

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>Of course, we can never truly know whether van Gogh would credit his artistic
                        genius to his best or worst times, but in examining his own description of
                        personal events and feelings, along with his own thoughts on his work, we
                        found that his happiness tended to have a very positive effect on the amount
                        of work he produced. His good health and unstress consistently lined up with
                        his periods of higher productivity, meaning van Gogh's well-being was more
                        important to his art than his suffering was. To put it in his words, “I
                        think the success or failure of a drawing also depends greatly on the mood
                        and the condition of the painter. Therefore I do what I can to keep cheerful
                        and clear-headed. But sometimes, like now, a heavy depression comes over me,
                        and then it’s hell.” -Vincent van Gogh in a letter to his brother, Theo.
                        January 26, 1882.</p>
                    <p>Our team found Vincent's letters to Theo <a

                        letters can be found as well.</p>
