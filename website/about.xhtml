                <p>Vincent van Gogh has inspired countless people around the world, and since his
                    death has become one of the most famous and influential artists of the modern
                    era. Throughout his career, he produced close to 2,100 works, most of which were
                    completed during the final years of his life. His legacy is one of art and
                    productivity.</p>
                <p>Also included in his legacy, however, are his struggles with mental health. A
                    popular narrative about a "tortured artist" has often orbited around his name
                    and work, with many believing it was his poor mental health that allowed him to
                    create such famous works of beauty.</p>
                <p>Many fans of his are familiar with the stories of van Gogh eating paint, cutting
                    his own ear off, and ultimately commiting suicide. More than that, they credit
                    such struggle to his success. But is his pain really what led to his work
                    finding the love and acclaim it did?</p>
                <p>The aim of this project is to determine whether van Gogh's most productive
                    periods were due to his lowest moments, or if there's more to the story than
                    many people think. Through analyzing van Gogh's letters to his brother, Theo, we
                    hope to learn from the man and painter himself about how he was feeling when he
                    completed his most famous and revered works. </p>

                <h2>Research Methods</h2>
                <hr/>
                <p>In order to grasp as much of an understanding as possible about van Gogh and his personal
                    life, our team decided analysing the letters sent to Vincent's brother, Theo, was best.
                    The two were especially close and wrote often to one another, and seemed to be the best
                    source for reliable information regarding van Gogh's health and well-being.</p>
                <p>Consistency was key in analyzing these letters, so we used a handful of phrases when
                    marking up each letter. When van Gogh mentioned stress, we decided on a handful of
                    consistent reasons to mark it. It ranged from money to friendships, family to his
                    career, and was sometimes even due to love.</p>
                <p>When he mentioned feeling particulary delighted at something, it was marked as
                    unstressed, with the same handful of reasons we had designated for stressed. We
                    refrained from marking anything as proof of "bad" or "good" mental health unless van
                    Gogh explicitly stated how he was feeling, such as this phrase from a letter to Theo:
                    "<em>I’m very glad</em> indeed that it’s been arranged for me to work here quietly
                    for a while." </p>
                <p>Just as important in our markup was making sure to catch every mention of work. Whether
                    it was a sketch, drawing, or painting, we made sure to mark it as work. We specified
                    whether it was work he planned to start, whether it was finished, or whether he was in
                    the middle of completing it.</p>
                <p>With all of this information available, we were able to use Topic Modeling to find any
                    connections between his state of health and his productivity.</p>
