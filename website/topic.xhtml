                <p> The results on this page were generated from the use of the open source
                    software, MALLET. According to the <a href="http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/">Mallet
                        page on the University of Amherst Site:</a>MALLET is a Java-based package
                    for statistical natural language processing, document classification,
                    clustering, topic modeling, information extraction, and other machine learning
                    applications to text. A tuturial on how to run your own topic model and generate
                    visuals can be found at <a href="https://github.com/nmcdowell00/MALLET_tutorial"
                        >this repository</a>. The visuals on this page were generated by Excel. To
                    create proper visuals refer to the tutorial linked above. </p>

                <hr />
                <p>The image to the left depicts a typical a MALLET command. This command is entered
                    into the command line, prompting MALLET to retrieve a series of text files and
                    process them. MALLET works by processing each word in the corpus of documents
                    and placing said word into a set number of topics. At first this process is at
                    first random but as more words are processed MALLET recognizes that there are
                    patterns within the text and it begins to sort words based on how similar they
                    are to the words that are already sorted into topics. One run through a corpus
                    is 1 iteration. If another iteration is run(In this case 800 were run) MALLET
                    takes each word from its topic and resorts it. So on. Thus, topics become more
                    specific at higher # of iterations (there is a practical limit). <strong>(Figure
                        1)</strong></p>

                <p>The image above shows the command that would follow the above
                    command and generate results for analysis which will be shown below.

                <p>These results come from input all of the markup into MALLET with the
                    specifications of 10 topics and 800 iterations. I found Topic 1,3,5,7 and 9 to
                    be most significant. These topics are highlighted on the chart to the left.
                    Topic 1 contains words that are associated with religion, a major influence on
                    Van Gogh in his earlier years. Topic 3 and 5 consist of words associated with
                    Van Gogh's work as an artist as well as his inspirations. Topic 7 included words
                    linked with nature. Nature was a source of inspiration many for Van Gogh's
                    pieces. Topic 9 contains words associated with his homelife and
                        family. <strong>(Figure 3)</strong>

            <p>The above graph is an exmaple of how the data from MALLET would look without
                using some sort of smooting method(Cubic Bezier, polynomial interpolation). As
                you can see it is very hard to interpret this figure due to the jagged and
                cluttered nature of the lines. <strong>(Figure 4)</strong>

                <h2>Figure 5</h2>
                <p>The graph below shows how polynomial interpolation can make MAlLET results much
                    easier to read. This graph depicts the Topic Model of the entire corpus letter
                    written by Van Gogh. To understand this graph you must refer back to
                        <strong>Figure 3</strong>. For clarification, the Y axis is the measuremnt
                    of Topic Weight, how present a topic is in a certain letter. The most
                    siginificant parts of this graph are marked by number. The gray line, Topic 9,
                    represents Van Gogh's connection with his family and his home. This can be
                    determined by analyzing the 20 words that are grouped into topic 9. The
                    connection with his family and home is highlighted by the words <strong>evening,
                        uncle, home, letter, and write</strong>. It might be hard for the
                    unaquantied reader to make much sense of the words in the topic as they have not
                    read the letters Van Gogh wrote to his brother. This is a problem with
                    presenting MALLET data. The results are very subjective as MALLET is not aware
                    of what any of the words mean. It sorts topics algorithmically(more information
                    can be found in the tuturial linked above). It is usually up to the person
                    generating the results to interpret the meaning of each topic. It can be seen
                    the Topic 9 is very present in letter from 1972-1980 but not present in letters
                    from 1880-1890. This represents his sepeartion from his home due to his career
                    as a painter causing him to move around Europe as well as take over most of his
                    time. Line 5 and 3 are also notable because these topics are linked to Van
                    Gogh's work through words such as <strong>paintings, canvas, studies, colours,
                        portrait, studio, model</strong>. It can be seen that these two topics rise
                    in Weight from 1880 to 1890. This is indicative of Van Gogh producing more
                    works. Topic 7 is also of note because it refers to Van Gogh's connection with
                    nature through the words <strong>sky, winter, trees, and landscape</strong>.
                    Nature was one of Van Gogh's greatest joys and inspirations. It can be seen that
                    nature is very present in between 1880 and 1888 but becomes less present from
                    1888-1890(during this time Van Gogh was in out of mental institutions). The way
                    I look at this data is that as Van Gogh progressed in his career he lost
                    connection with his family. Work started to take over his life and eventually
                    took place of his joys and even his inspirations(nature). These factors can be
                    linked with his descent into mental instability. <strong></strong>

                <p>The grpah belows depicts the trends of the 10 topics presented in the chart
                    above. The lines of most importance are linked with the rows that have a first
                    cell filled with color(topics 2,3,5,6). Topic 2 represents Van Gogh's connection
                    with his family and home. Topic 3 and 5 represents Van Gogh's devotion to
                    Christ, a constant theme through this period as he was practicing to become a
                    pastor. Topic 6 is connected with Van Gogh's constant walks throughout the city
                    which were a source of happiness as well as inspiration for him. This visual is
                    not a great indicator of mental health becuase during this period was not a time
                    of instability for Van Gogh. The data generated can be used to understand what
                    Van Gogh's focuses during this period were. It seems that they were God, family,
                    some painting (present in topic 4 and 9) and the world around him. </p>

                <p>The grpah belows depicts the trends of the 10 topics presented in the chart
                    above. The lines of most importance are linked with the rows that have a first
                    cell filled with color(topics 3,4,6,10). Topic 3 is connected with Van Gogh's
                    work as a painter and his brother Theo's work as an art dealer. During this
                    period Theo and Van Gogh conducting their business together; Van Gogh would send
                    works to Theo and Theo would attempt to sell them. This situation seems
                    convenient but in fact created a lot of stress for the both of them. Van Gogh
                    became financially depdendent on Theo. During this period it would have been
                    impossible for Van Gogh to fund the vast majority of his painting without Theo's
                    help. This type of financial stress can be connected to Topic 10 by the words
                        <strong>money, order, francs, pay</strong>. By following the line plotted
                    for topic 10 it is obvious that this money stress was present throughout this
                    period. Topic 6 is not very present in this collection of letters but I thought
                    that the topic indicated some sort of emotional and spirtual fight that Van Gogh
                    was trying to overcome; evident through the words <strong>love, woman, god,
                        reality, experience, sympahty.</strong>

                    above. The lines of most importance are linked with the rows that have a first
                    cell filled with color(topics 3,4,6,9). This is the period in which Van Gogh was
                    in mental institution for some periods of time. Topic 6 can be interepretted to
                    reference the stress with money that Van Gogh had during this time. This is
                    evident through the words <strong>Ganguin, money, send, Francs,
                        business.</strong> Some sources say that during this time Van Gogh was in
                    trouble with Ganguin for money he owed him. There are many conspiracy theories
                    that Van Gogh's ear was acutally cut off by Ganguin due to these debts. This
                    period was actually Van Gogh's most productive time. Work is referenced in topic
                    2,3,4,5,7, and 10; topic 4 being the most notable. It seems that topic 9
                    indicates poor health due to the inclusion of the words <strong>hospital and
                        illness</strong>.</p>

                <p>For this projct MALLET was a good tool for deconstructing the corpus. The topics
                    generated for each period helped me understand the core elements of Van Gogh's
                    life during that period. The figures that are most helpful for answering our
                    research question are Figures 5 and 11. Through these figures it seems that the
                    main drivers of Van Gogh's mental instabilyu were his stresses with money,
                    stress from work, and lack of connection from family, friends, and God.</p>
