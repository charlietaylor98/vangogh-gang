                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <hr />
                <p>Vincent van Gogh has inspired countless people around the world, and since his
                    death has become one of the most famous and influential artists of the modern
                    era. Throughout his career, he produced close to 2,100 works, most of which were
                    completed during the final years of his life. His legacy is one of art and
                    productivity.</p>
                <p>Also included in his legacy, however, are his struggles with mental health. A
                    popular narrative about a "tortured artist" has often orbited around his name
                    and work, with many believing it was his poor mental health that allowed him to
                    create such famous works of beauty.</p>
                <p>Many fans of his are familiar with the stories of van Gogh eating paint, cutting
                    his own ear off, and ultimately commiting suicide. More than that, they credit
                    such struggle to his success. But is his pain really what led to his work
                    finding the love and acclaim it did?</p>
                <p>The aim of this project is to determine whether van Gogh's most productive
                    periods were due to his lowest moments, or if there's more to the story than
                    many people think. Through analyzing van Gogh's letters to his brother, Theo, we
                    hope to learn from the man and painter himself about how he was feeling when he
                    completed his most famous and revered works. </p>
