      <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
      <body>
            <p> It’s already rather late, i.e. nearly 12 o’clock, but I still want to write a few
                  words to you today. First of all, because it was such a long time ago that I wrote
                  to you — but old chap, what should I write to you? — <stress reason="career">am swamped with all kinds of
                  work here, so that the days pass by, but often one doesn’t even have time to think
                  or do things that would otherwise appeal to one.</stress> But what particularly compels me
                  to write is what I heard from home, namely that they’ve offered to send you to
                  Paris for 6 weeks. If you go there, you’ll pass by the Borinage. Wouldn’t you
                  consider spending a day here, or longer if possible? I’d so much like you to know
                  this country, because there’s so very much that’s unique to be noticed by those
                  who look at things closely. Wouldn’t it be remarkable for someone who had never
                  seen a seaside village to see Scheveningen or Katwijk or some other village? Well
                  then — there’s no sea here, but the character of all things is interesting and
                  worth getting to know. So should you feel the desire and are so inclined, and can
                  find the time and opportunity, please stop over here, but write ahead of time when
                  you’re coming and whereabouts I can find you, at which station and on which train. </p>
            <p> I’ll give this letter to Ma when she comes, because in all likelihood I’ll be
                  meeting her when she returns from Paris. Am eagerly longing to see her. </p>
            <p> Fortunately for Uncle, the danger seems to have been averted for the time being. </p>
            <p> What affected me deeply was hearing that Frans Soek died, I’d like to hear some
                  particulars in the matter from you, if you happen to know anything, poor chap,
                  life wasn’t easy for him, but rather quite a struggle. </p>
            <p> We had a terrible storm here a couple of days ago, around 11 o’clock in the evening.
                  There’s a place nearby where one can see in the distance, below, a large part of
                  the Borinage, with the chimneys, mountains of coal, small workers’ houses, small
                  black figures moving about during the day as though in an ants’ nest, in the far
                  distance dark fir woods with small white workers’ houses in front of them, a
                  couple of little towers in the distance, an old mill. Usually a sort of fog hangs
                  over it, or else there’s the fanciful effect of light and shade owing to the
                  shadows of clouds that remind one of paintings by Rembrandt or Michel or Ruisdael.
                  But on the occasion of that storm in the pitchblack night, it was a special effect
                  caused by the flashes of lightning that made everything visible just for a moment
                  now and then. Nearby, the large, sombre buildings of the Marcasse mine, standing
                  alone and set apart on the flat field, which that night, during the violent rains,
                  truly reminded one of the hulk of Noah’s ark, as it would have appeared in the
                  darkness of the Flood by the light of a lightning flash. Inspired by the
                  impression made by that storm, I included a description of a shipwreck in the
                  Bible reading this evening. </p>
            <p> Am currently reading Uncle Tom’s cabin a lot — there’s still so much slavery in the
                  world — and in that astonishingly beautiful book this extremely momentous matter
                  is treated with such wisdom, with a love and a zeal and interest in the genuine
                  welfare of the poor and oppressed, that one can’t help coming back to it again and
                  again and finding more in it each time. </p>
            <p> I know no better definition of the word Art than this, ‘Art is man added to nature’,
                  nature, reality, truth, but with a meaning, with an interpretation, with a
                  character that the artist brings out and to which he gives expression, which he
                  sets free, which he unravels, releases, elucidates. </p>
            <p> A painting by Mauve or Maris or Israëls speaks more and more clearly than nature
                  itself. So it is with books as well, and in Uncle Tom’s cabin in particular,
                  things have been put in a new light by the artist, and thus in that book, even
                  though it’s already beginning to be an old book, i.e. one written years ago, all
                  things are made new. It’s so subtly felt, it’s so well worked out, it’s so
                  masterly. It was written with so much love, so much seriousness and so faithful to
                  the truth and with knowledge of the subject. It’s so humble and simple but at the
                  same time so truly sublime, so noble and so distinguished. </p>
            <p> Recently read a book about the English coalmining district, but it didn’t give very
                  many details. Herewith a woodcut for your scrapbook. </p>
            <p> Lately made the acquaintance of someone who supervised the workers for years. Is of
                  humble origins but worked his way up. Now he has a chest complaint, quite serious,
                  and can no longer stand the terribly exhausting work down in the mine. It’s very
                  important to hear him talk about the subject. He has always remained the workmen’s
                  friend (in contrast to many others who worked their way up, not because of true
                  distinction but because of money, driven by motives less noble and many times more
                  base). He has a labourer’s heart, true and honest and courageous, but is far above
                  most of them as regards intellectual development. </p>
            <p> On more than one occasion during a strike, he was the only person who could exert
                  any influence on the workers. </p>
            <p> They would hear no one, they would listen to no one but him, and at the critical
                  moment no one was obeyed but him alone. When I met him for the first time, I
                  thought of the etching after Meissonier, with which you are familiar, The reader.
                  One of Denis’s boys is as good as engaged to his daughter, which is why he comes
                  here to the house, though but seldom, and I made his acquaintance. Since then I’ve
                  visited him a few times. </p>
            <p> Have you ever read Legouvé’s Les pères et les enfants, that’s a remarkable book,
                  found it there in the house and read it with interest. </p>
            <p> Received a letter a few days ago from the Rev. Jones of Isleworth in which he writes
                  about the building of wooden churches here in the Borinage. Is it feasible? Is it
                  desirable? He has a mind to work towards that goal, i.e. erecting the first of
                  such buildings. </p>
            <p> Even talks about coming over here sometime in the autumn to discuss the matter. </p>
            <p> I truly wish that such a thing may come to pass. </p>
            <p> Write a few words if you have time, and if you can, stop here on your way to Paris.
                  In any event, let me know if possible on which train you’ll be passing through one
                  of the railway stations in the vicinity of Wasmes, and which station, because I’ll
                  do my best to be there. </p>
            <p>Blessings on your work, and believe me ever</p>
