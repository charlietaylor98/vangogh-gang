  <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
  <body>
    <p> It’s time I write to you again, first of all to wish you happiness at the beginning of a new
      year. May much good be your share, and God’s blessing be on your work in this year that we’re
      beginning. </p>
    <p> I’m eagerly longing for a letter from you, to hear again how things are going and how you
      are, also perhaps to hear if you have recently seen anything beautiful or remarkable. </p>
    <p> As far as I’m concerned, you surely understand that there are no paintings here in the
      Borinage, that in general they haven’t the slightest idea of what a painting is, so it goes
      without saying that I’ve seen absolutely nothing in the way of art since my departure from
      Brussels. But this doesn’t mean that this isn’t a very special and very picturesque country,
      everything speaks, as it were, and is full of character. There was snow these last few days,
      the dark days before Christmas. Then everything was reminiscent of the medieval paintings by
      Peasant Bruegel, among others, and by so many others who were so good at expressing the
      singular effect of red and green, black and white. Time and again, what one sees here reminds
      one of the work of Thijs Maris or Albrecht Dürer, for example. </p>
    <p> There are sunken roads here, overgrown with thornbushes and with old, twisted trees with
      their gnarled roots, which look exactly like that road in the etching by Dürer, The knight and
      Death. </p>
    <p> <unstress reason="environment">These last few days, for instance, it was an extraordinary sight, with the white snow in the
      evening around the twilight hour, seeing the workers returning home from the mines. </unstress>These
      people are completely black when they come out of the dark mines into the daylight again, they
      look just like chimneysweeps. Their houses are usually small and could better be called huts,
      scattered along the sunken roads and in the wood and against the slopes of the hills. One sees
      mosscovered roofs here and there, and the light shines kindly in the evening through the
      smallpaned windows.Just as in Brabant we have the copse and the oak wood, and in Holland the
      pollard willows, so here one sees those black thornbushes around the gardens, fields and land.
      The recent snow gave it the effect of letters written on white paper, like the pages of the
      gospel. </p>
    <p> I’ve already spoken here at various times, both in a fairly large room, specially furnished
      for religious meetings, and in the gatherings that are customarily held in the workers’ houses
      in the evenings, which one can best call Biblereading. Spoke, among other things, on: the
      parable of the mustard seed, the barren fig tree, the man who was blind from his birth. On
      Christmas, of course, on the stable of Bethlehem, and Peace on earth. </p>
    <p> May it come to pass with God’s blessing that I be placed here permanently somewhere; I
      should sincerely wish it. </p>
    <p> Everywhere around here one sees the big chimneys and the huge mountains of coal at the
      entrance to the mines, the socalled coalpits. You know that large drawing by Bosboom,
      Chaudfontaine, it conveys the character of the land here well, only here everything is coal,
      in the north of Hainaut stonequarries, and Chaudfontaine more iron ore. </p>
    <p> I still think so often of that day when you were in Brussels and of our visit to the Museum.
      And I often wish that you were a bit closer and we could be together more often. Do write
      again soon. Again and again I look at that etching of A young citizen. The mineworkers’
      language is not all that easy to understand, but they understand normal French well if one can
      speak it rapidly and fluently, then it naturally resembles their dialect, which is spoken
      amazingly fast. At a gathering this week I spoke on the text Acts XVI:9 ‘And a vision appeared
      to Paul in the night; There stood a man of Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come over into
      Macedonia, and help us.’ And they listened attentively when I tried to describe what that
      Macedonian was like who needed and longed for the comfort of the gospel and the knowledge of
      the Only True God. How we should imagine him as a worker with signs of sorrow and suffering
      and fatigue on his face, without form or glory but with an immortal soul that has need of the
      meat which endureth unto everlasting life, namely the Word of God, for man cannot live by
      bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. </p>
    <p> How Jesus Christ is the Master who can strengthen, comfort and enlighten a man like the
      Macedonian, a workman and labourer who has a hard life. Because He himself is the great Man of
      Sorrows, who knows our diseases, who himself is called the carpenter’s son, even though He was
      the Son of God and the great physician of sick souls. Who worked for 30 years in a humble
      carpenter’s workshop to carry out God’s will; and God wants man to live and walk humbly upon
      the earth, in imitation of Christ, minding not high things, but condescending to men of low
      estate, learning from the gospel to be meek and lowly in heart. </p>
    <p> I’ve already had the opportunity to visit a few sick people, for many people here are ill.
      Wrote today to the president of the Comité d’Evangelisation to request that my case be brought
      before the next meeting of the committee. </p>
    <p> <unstress reason="environment">It thawed last night, I cannot tell you how picturesque the hilly countryside looks in the
      thaw, now that the snow is melting and the black fields with the green of the winter wheat are
      again becoming visible.</unstress> For foreigners the villages here are truly a maze, with countless
      narrow streets and alleyways with the small houses of the workers, at the foot of the hills as
      well as on their slopes and at the top. It can best be compared to a village like
      Scheveningen, especially the poor quarters, or to those villages in Brittany that we know from
      paintings. For that matter, you rode through this region yourself on the railway journey to
      and from Paris, and maybe remember it a little. The Protestant churches are small, similar to
      the one in Hoeven, but slightly larger, but where I spoke was only a simple, large room that
      can hold a hundred people if necessary. I also attended a service in a stable or barn, so it’s
      quite simple and novel. </p>
    <p> Write soon when you have the time, and remember that you are repeatedly, even constantly, in
      my thoughts. Wishing again that God’s best blessings may be your share in the new year, and
      shaking your hand in thought, believe me ever </p>
  </body>
  <close>Your most loving brother</close>

  <ps>
    <p> Give my regards to everyone at the Rooses’ and wish them all, and anyone who should happen
      to ask after me, a happy New Year. If you write, please address your letter care of M.
      Vanderhaegen, Colporteur à Pâturages près de Mons (Borinage Haînaut).</p>
