    <salutation> My dear Theo,</salutation>
    <body>
        <p>Thanks for your letter, I was glad to hear that you got back safely. I missed you the
            first few days, and it was strange for me not to find you when I came home in the
            afternoon.<unstress reason = "family"> We spent some pleasant days together</unstress>, and actually did go for some walks and
            see a thing or two whenever we had the chance.</p>
        <p>What terrible weather, you must feel anxious on your walks to Oisterwijk. Yesterday there
            were trotting races on the occasion of the exhibition, but the illumination and
            fireworks were postponed because of the bad weather, so it’s just as well you didn’t
            stay to see them. Regards from the Haanebeeks and the Rooses.</p>
