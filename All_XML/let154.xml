    <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
    <body>
        <p> It’s mainly to tell you that I’m grateful for your visit that I’m writing to you. It was
            quite a long time ago that we saw each other or wrote to each other as we used to. All
            the same, it’s better that we feel something for each other rather than behave like
            corpses towards one another, the more so because as long as one has no real right to be
            called a corpse by being legally dead, it smacks of hypocrisy or at least childishness
            to pose as such. Childish in the manner of a young man of 14 years who thinks that his
            dignity and social standing actually oblige him to wear a top hat. The hours we spent
            together in this way have at least assured us that we’re both still in the land of the
            living. <bad_health>When I saw you again and took a walk with you, I had the same feeling I used to
            have more than I do now, as though life were something good and precious that one should
            cherish, and I felt more cheerful and alive than I had been for a long time, because in
            spite of myself life has gradually become or has seemed much less precious to me, much
            more unimportant and indifferent.</bad_health> <bad_health>When one lives with others and is bound by a feeling
            of affection one is aware that one has a reason for being, that one might not be
            entirely worthless and superfluous but perhaps good for one thing or another,
            considering that we need one another and are making the same journey as travelling
            companions.</bad_health> Proper selfrespect, however, is also very dependent on relations with
            others. </p>
        <p> A prisoner who’s kept in isolation, who’s prevented from working, would in the long run,
            especially if this were to last too long, suffer the consequences just as surely as one
            who went hungry for too long. Like everyone else, <stress reason="friendship">I have need of relationships of
            friendship or affection or trusting companionship, and am not like a street pump or
            lamppost, whether of stone or iron, so that I can’t do without them without perceiving
            an emptiness and feeling their lack,</stress> like any other generally civilized and highly
            respectable man — and I tell you these things to let you know what a salutary effect
            your visit had on me. </p>
        <p> And just as I wished that we not drift apart, this is also the case with regard to those
            at home. Even so, at the moment I really dread going there and am strongly inclined to
            stay here. It could, however, be my fault, and you could be right in thinking that I
            don’t see things straight, which is why it may be that, despite my great reluctance and
            notwithstanding that it’s a hard journey, I’m going to Etten for at least a few days. </p>
        <p> As I think back on your visit with thankfulness, our talks naturally come to mind. I’ve
            heard such talks before, many, in fact, and often. Plans for improvement and change and
            raising the spirits — and yet, don’t let it anger you, I’m a little afraid of them —
            also because I sometimes acted upon them and ended up rather disappointed. How much has
            been well thought out that is, however, impracticable. </p>
        <p> The time spent at Amsterdam is still so fresh in my memory. You were there yourself, and
            so you know how the pros and cons were weighed, considered and deliberated upon,
            reasoned with wisdom, how it was well meant — and yet how pitiful the result, how daft
            the whole business, how grossly stupid. I still shudder at the thought. It was the worst
            time I’ve ever gone through. How desirable and appealing the rather difficult and
            troubled days here in this poor country, in these primitive surroundings, seem to me
            compared with then. Something similar, I fear, will be the result of following wise
            counsel given with the best of intentions. </p>
        <p> For such experiences are pretty drastic for me. The damage, the sorrow, the heart’s
            regretfulness is too great for both of us not to have learned the hard way. If we don’t
            learn from this, what shall we then learn from? A striving such as reaching the goal set
            before me, as it was put then, truly that is an ambition that won’t easily take hold of
            me again, the desire to achieve it has cooled considerably, and I now look at things
            from a different perspective, even though it may sound and look attractive, and even
            though it’s unacceptable to think about it as experience taught me to think about it.
            Unacceptable, yes, just as, for example, Francq the Evangelist finds it unacceptable
            that I declared the sermons given by the Rev. Jean Andry to be only slightly more
            evangelical than the sermons of a priest. I would rather die a natural death than be
            prepared for it by the academy, and have occasionally had a lesson from a grassmower
            that seemed to me more useful than one in Greek. </p>
        <p> I<bad_health>mprovement in my life — should I not desire it or should I not be in need of
            improvement? I really want to improve. But it’s precisely because I yearn for it that
            I’m afraid of remedies that are worse than the disease. Can you blame a sick person if
            he looks the doctor straight in the eye and prefers not to be treated wrongly or by a
            quack?</bad_health> </p>
        <p> Does someone who has consumption or typhus do wrong by maintaining that a stronger
            remedy than barley water might be useful or even necessary, or, finding that barley
            water in itself can do no harm, nevertheless doubts its efficacy and potency in his
            particular case? </p>
        <p> The doctor who prescribed barley water mustn’t say, this patient is a stubborn person
            who is set upon his own ruin because he doesn’t want to take medicine — no, because the
            man is not unwilling, but the socalled medicine was unsuitable, because it was indeed
            ‘it’ but still not yet ‘it’ at all. </p>
        <p> Do you blame someone if he fails to be moved by a painting which is recorded in the
            catalogue as a Memling but which has nothing to do with Memling other than that it’s a
            similar subject from the Gothic period but without artistic value? </p>
        <p> And if you should now assume from what I’ve said that I intended to say you were a quack
            because of your advice then you will have completely misunderstood me, since I have no
            such idea or opinion of you. </p>
        <p> If, on the other hand, you think that I thought I would do well to take your advice
            literally and become a lithographer of invoice headings and visiting cards, or a
            bookkeeper or a carpenter’s apprentice — likewise that of my very dear sister Anna to
            devote myself to the baker’s trade or many other things of that kind (quite remarkably
            diverse and mutually exclusive) — which it was suggested I pursue, you would also be
            mistaken. But, you say, I’m not giving you this advice for you to follow to the letter,
            but because I thought you had a taste for idling and because I was of the opinion that
            you should put an end to it. </p>
        <p> <stress reason="friendship">Might I be allowed to point out to you that such idling is really a rather strange sort
            of idling. It’s rather difficult for me to defend myself on this score, but I would be
            sorry if you couldn’t eventually see this in a different light. I also don’t know if I
            would do well to counter such accusations by following the advice to become a baker, for
            example. That would really be a sufficient answer (supposing it were possible for us to
            assume the guise of a baker or haircutter or librarian with lightning speed) and yet
            actually a foolish response, rather like the way the man acted who, when accused of
            heartlessness because he was sitting on a donkey, immediately dismounted and continued
            on his way with the donkey on his shoulders</stress>. </p>
        <p> And, joking apart, I honestly think it would be better if the relationship between us
            were more trusting on both sides. <stress reason="friendship">If I must seriously feel that I’m annoying or
            burdensome to you or those at home, useful for neither one thing nor another, and were
            to go on being forced to feel like an intruder or a fifth wheel in your presence, so
            that it would be better I weren’t there, and if I should have to continue trying to keep
            further and further out of other people’s way</stress> — <bad_health>if I think that indeed it would be so
            and cannot be otherwise, then I’m overcome by a feeling of sorrow and I must struggle
            against despair. </bad_health></p>
        <p> <bad_health>It’s difficult for me to bear these thoughts and more difficult still to bear the
            thought that so much discord, misery and sorrow, in our midst and in our family, has
            been caused by me.</bad_health> </p>
        <p> <bad_health>If it were indeed so, then I’d truly wish that it be granted me not to have to go on
            living too long. </bad_health>Yet whenever this depresses me beyond measure, all too deeply, after a
            long time the thought also occurs to me: <bad_health>it’s perhaps only a bad, terrible dream, and
            later we’ll perhaps learn to understand and comprehend it better.</bad_health> But is it not, after
            all, reality, and won’t it one day become better rather than worse? To many it would no
            doubt appear foolish and superstitious to believe in any improvement for the better.
            Sometimes in winter it’s so bitterly cold that one says, it’s simply too cold, what do I
            care whether summer comes, the bad outweighs the good. <bad_health>But whether we like it or not, an
            end finally comes to the hard frost, and one fine morning the wind has turned and we
            have a thaw. Comparing the natural state of the weather with our state of mind and our
            circumstances, subject to variableness and change, I still have some hope that it can
            improve</bad_health>. </p>
        <p> <bad_health>If you write, soon perhaps, you will make me happy.</bad_health> Just in case, address your letter
            care of J.Bte Denis, rue du PetitWasmes à Wasmes (Hainaut). </p>
        <p> Walked to Wasmes after your departure that evening. Have since drawn a portrait. </p>
        <p> Adieu, accept in thought a handshake, and believe me </p>
    </body>
    <close>Yours truly,</close>
