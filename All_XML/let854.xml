  <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
  <body>
    <p>I was in the middle of writing to you to send you the reply for Mr Aurier when your letter
      arrived. <unstress reason="family">Am very pleased that Jo and the newborn are well and that she expects to be able to
      get up in a few days from now.</unstress> Then what you write about our sister also interests me a great
      deal. I consider that she was lucky to see Degas at his home. I still think that she would
      above all make a good doctor’s wife. Anyway, one can’t exactly force these things,
      nevertheless it’s good to have one’s eyes open if the opportunity were to present itself.</p>
    <p>And so Gauguin has come back to Paris – I’m going to copy my reply to Mr Aurier to send it to
      him, and you can let him read the article from the Mercure. For really I consider that one
      should say things like that about Gauguin, and about me nothing except very secondarily.</p>
    <p><stress reason="friendship">Gauguin wrote to me that he’d exhibited in Denmark and that this exhibition had been very
      successful. To me it seems a shame that he didn’t continue here a bit longer. The two of us
      together would have worked better than myself all alone this year. And at present we’d have a
      little cottage of our own to stay in and work, and could even accommodate others.</stress></p>
    <p>Did you notice in that newspaper you sent me an article on the fruitfulness of certain
      artists. Of Corot, Rousseau, Dupré; do you remember how many times when Reid was
      there that we talked about that, even of the necessity to produce a lot.</p>
    <p>And that shortly after I came to Paris I said to you that before I had two hundred canvases I
      wouldn’t be able to do anything. What would appear to some people to be working too fast is in
      reality completely the ordinary run of things, the normal state of regular production,
      considering that a painter must work really just as hard as a shoemaker, for example. Would it
      not be a good idea to send Reid, and perhaps also Tersteeg, or rather C.M., a copy of Aurier’s
      article?</p>
    <p>The thing is that it seems to me that we ought to take advantage of it to try to place
      something in Scotland, either now or later.</p>
    <p><work origin="new" stage="finished">I think you’ll like the canvas for Mr Aurier, it’s in terribly thick impasto and worked like
      certain Monticellis, I’ve kept it for almost a year.</work></p>
    <p>But I consider that I must try to give him something good for that article, which is in
      itself a very artistic thing; and it really serves us well for the day when we, like everyone,
      will be obliged to try and recover what the paintings cost.</p>
    <p>Everything beyond that leaves me quite cold, but recovering the money it costs to produce,
      that’s the very condition of being able to continue.</p>
    <p><work stage="middle" origin="new">For the Impressionists’ exhibition in March I hope to send you a few more canvases which are
      drying at the moment. If they didn’t arrive in time you would have to make a choice from those
      that are at père Tanguy’s. I’ve tried to copy Daumier’s Drinkers and Doré’s Penitentiary, it’s
      very difficult.</work></p>
    <p><work origin="new" stage="planned">In the next few days I hope to begin on Delacroix’s Good Samaritan and Millet’s
      Woodcutter.</work></p>
    <p>Aurier’s article would encourage me, if I dared let myself go, to risk emerging from reality
      more and making a kind of tonal music with colour, as some Monticellis are. But the truth is
      so dear to me, trying to create something true also, anyway I think, I think I still prefer to
      be a shoemaker than to be a musician, with colours. In any event, trying to remain true is
      perhaps a remedy to combat the illness that still continues to worry me. Lately my health is
      quite good, however, and I’d dare to believe that if I were to spend a while with you that
      would have a lot of effect upon me to counteract the influence that the company I have here
      necessarily exerts. But it seems to me that there’s no hurry about this, and that we must
      consider calmly if this is the moment to spend money on the journey. Perhaps by sacrificing
      the journey one could be useful to Gauguin or Lauzet.</p>
    <p><stress reason="money">A few days ago I bought a suit that cost me 35 francs, I must pay for it towards the end of
      March. With this I’ll have sufficient for the year, for when I came here I also bought a suit
      for around 35 francs, and it has served me all year. But I’ll need a pair of shoes and a few
      pairs of drawers in March as well.</stress></p>
    <p>All things considered, life here isn’t very expensive, I think that in the north one would
      spend rather more.</p>
    <p>And that’s why – even if I came to you for a while – the best policy might still be to
      continue the work here. I don’t know – and either is good to me – but we mustn’t hurry to
      move.</p>
    <p>And don’t you think that in Antwerp, if we put Gauguin’s plan into practice, one would have
      to maintain a certain rank, furnish a studio, in short do as the majority of established Dutch
      painters do? It’s not as simple as it appears, and would fear for him as well as for myself a
      regular siege by the established artists, and he would have the same story as he had before in
      Denmark. Anyway, we’d have to begin to say to ourselves that it’s still through the same
      procedure that the established painters can cause troubles for adventurers, as we’d be in
      Antwerp, and even oblige them to decamp. And as for the dealers there, we mustn’t count on
      them at all.</p>
    <p>The academy there is better, and they work more vigorously there than in Paris. And then
      Gauguin is still in Paris at the moment, his reputation is holding up there, and if he leaves
      for Antwerp he could find that it’s rather difficult to come back to Paris. Going to Antwerp I
      would fear for Gauguin rather than for myself, for naturally I can get by in Flemish, I resume
      the studies of peasants I began before and abandoned with much regret – there’s no need to
      tell you that I have a great love of the Kempen. But I foresee that for him the battle could
      be very tough. I think that you’ll tell him the pros and cons of this absolutely as<stress reason="friendship"> I would
      tell him, I’ll write to him one of these days, especially to send him the reply to Mr Aurier’s
      article, and I’d think that if he wanted we could still work here together if his steps to
      find a position were to come to nothing.</stress> But he’s skilful, and perhaps he’ll come through it
      in Paris itself, and if he holds on there for his reputation he does well, for he always has
      this, that he was the first one of all to work in the heart of a tropical land. And one will
      necessarily come back to that matter. Above all, give him my warm regards, and if he wants he
      can take the repetitions of the Sunflowers and the repetition of the Berceuse in exchange for
      something of his that would give you pleasure.</p>
    <p><work stage="planned" origin="existing">If I came to Paris I would have to rework several canvases done in the beginning here, I
      wouldn’t have any lack of work then.</work> Warm regards to Jo, and good handshake in thought.</p>
