  <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
  <body>
    <p>My hearty congratulations on this day, many happy returns, have a good day tomorrow, and many
      good days in the year you’re now beginning. Time passes quickly and the days fly past – yet
      something can remain and the past isn’t entirely lost – <good_health>we can become richer and firmer of
      spirit, of character, of heart, we can become richer in God, we can become richer in the fine
      gold of life, the love for one another and the feeling ‘and yet I am not alone, because the
      Father is with me’.</good_health> May it be so for all of us, it is a good prayer, that one of Father’s: O
      Lord, join us intimately to one another and let our love for Thee make that bond ever
      stronger.</p>
    <p>I hope to see you soon, because when I go to Amsterdam I’m planning to stop in The Hague for
      a while. Don’t tell anyone about this, though, because my main purpose in doing so is to see
      you. </p>
    <p> I’m going to Etten this Wednesday, to stay there for a few days before putting my hand to
      the plough. </p>
    <p> I should have liked you to be here yesterday; in the morning I heard the Rev. Hooyer’s
      farewell sermon in the little French church. The church was full, he spoke with fire and
      feeling, <unstress reason ="environment">I was moved by the sight of that distinguished, singular congregation, the mood was
      very earnest.</unstress> He thanked them for the love that he had received from many of them, especially
      at difficult times, in the beginning, four years ago, when he was wrestling with the
      difficulties of speaking in French, because he’s a Dutchman. There were various other
      clergymen in the congregation. </p>
    <p> In the afternoon I went to the Grote Kerk to hear the Rev. Keller van Hoorn, whose text was
      ‘Our Father’; in the evening I heard the Rev. Greeff, whom I’d heard on my first Sunday
      evening here in Dordrecht. By chance, he took for his sermon yesterday the same text he had
      taken that first time: Now we see through a glass, darkly; now I know in part, but then shall
      I know even as also I am known. </p>
    <p> After church I walked along that path behind the station where we walked together, thinking
      of you and wishing we could be together – and kept on walking until I came to the cemetery at
      the end of a black cinder road running through the meadows that looked so beautiful in the
      twilight. <unstress reason ="environment">The cemetery looks a little like that drawing by Apol in ‘Eigen Haard’, there’s a
      canal around it and there’s a house surrounded by pine trees, yesterday evening the light was
      shining through the windows in such a friendly way – it’s an old house that looks like a
      parsonage.</unstress> There can still be much good in store for both of us, let us learn to say after Pa
      ‘I never despair’ and after Uncle Jan ‘the devil is never so black that one cannot look him in
      the face’. </p>
    <p> Write again soon, this Wednesday, then, I’ll be in Etten. Do you have De Plancy, Légendes
      des artistes, with woodcuts after Rochussen? I hope to bring it for you. </p>
    <p> These last few days I’ve managed, in between times, to work my way through the whole story
      of Christ from a catechism book written by Uncle Stricker, and I copied out the texts, which
      brought to mind so many paintings by Rembrandt and others. It is, I believe and trust, a
      choice not to be repented of, which I’ve made in an attempt to become a Christian and a
      Christian labourer. Yes, all things of the past can work together for good, familiarity with
      cities like London and Paris and life in such places as that school in Ramsgate and in
      Isleworth makes one more drawn and attached to many things and such books of the Bible as The
      Acts of the Apostles. Knowing and loving the work and life of such men as Jules Breton, Millet
      and Jacque, Rembrandt, Bosboom and so many others, can also be a source of ideas. What a
      similarity there is between the work and life of Pa and that of such men; that of Pa I rate
      even higher. </p>
    <p> God help us, old boy, He can make you and all of us and me say, Lord, it is enough. </p>
    <p>Adieu, accept a handshake in thought and again, hearty congratulations from</p>
  </body>
  <close>Your loving brother</close>
  <sig>Vincent</sig>
  <ps><p>The Lord bless thee, and keep thee: the Lord make his face shine upon thee, and give thee
      peace. May the Lord do above all that we ask and think. He is your keeper and the shade
      upon your right hand. May He be with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Give my
      regards to your housemates.</p></ps>
