      <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
      <body>
            <p> It’s time that you hear something from me again. I heard from home that you were in
                  Etten for a couple of days and that you were travelling for the firm. I sincerely
                  hope that your trip went well. </p>
            <p> These days you’ll no doubt be in the dunes and in Scheveningen now and then. <unstress reason="environment">Here
                  it’s also attractive in the country in the spring; here and there are places where
                  one could imagine oneself in the dunes, because of the hills.</unstress> </p>
            <p> I went on a very interesting excursion not long ago; the fact is, I spent 6 hours in
                  a mine. </p>
            <p> In one of the oldest and most dangerous mines in the area no less, called Marcasse.
                  This mine has a bad name because many die in it, whether going down or coming up,
                  or by suffocation or gas exploding, or because of water in the ground, or because
                  of old passageways caving in and so on. It’s a sombre place, and at first sight
                  everything around it has something dismal and deathly about it. The workers there
                  are usually people, emaciated and pale owing to fever, who look exhausted and
                  haggard, weatherbeaten and prematurely old, the women generally sallow and
                  withered. All around the mine are poor miners’ dwellings with a couple of dead
                  trees, completely black from the smoke, and thornhedges, dungheaps and rubbish
                  dumps, mountains of unusable coal. Maris would make a beautiful painting of it. </p>
            <p> <work origin="new" stage="planned">Later I’ll try and make a sketch of it to give you an idea of it. </work>Had a good guide,
                  a man who has already worked there for 33 years, a friendly and patient man who
                  explained everything clearly and tried to make it understandable. </p>
            <p> We went down together, 700 metres deep this time, and went into the most hidden
                  corners of that underworld. </p>
            <p> The maintenages or gradins (cells where the miners work) that are farthest removed
                  from the exit are called ‘des caches’ (hidden places, places where one searches).
                  This mine has 5 levels, 3 of which, the uppermost ones, are exhausted and
                  abandoned, one no longer works in them because there’s no more coal. If anyone
                  were to try and make a painting of the maintenages, that would be something new
                  and something unheardof or rather neverbeforeseen. Imagine a series of cells in a
                  rather narrow and low passageway, supported by rough timberwork. In each of the
                  cells is a worker in a coarse linen suit, dingy and soiled as a chimneysweep,
                  chipping away at the coal by the dim light of a small lamp. In some of the cells
                  the worker stands upright, in others (‘seams worked lying down’) he lies flat on
                  the ground. </p>
            <p> The arrangement is more or less like the cells in a beehive, or like a dark, sombre
                  passageway in an underground prison, or like a series of small looms, or actually
                  they look like a row of ovens such as one sees among the peasants, or like the
                  separate tombs in a vault. The passageways themselves are like the large chimneys
                  of the Brabant farmsteads. </p>
            <p> In some, water leaks in everywhere and the light of the miner’s lamp creates a
                  peculiar effect and reflects as in a cave full of stalactites. Some of the miners
                  work in the maintenages, others load the loosened coal into small wagons that are
                  transported along rails resembling a tramway. It’s mostly children who do this,
                  both boys and girls. There’s also a stable there, 700 metres below ground, with
                  around 7 old horses that transport larger amounts, bringing them to the socalled
                  accrochage, that being the place where they’re hauled up. Other workers are busy
                  restoring the antiquated passageways to prevent them from caving in, or are making
                  new passageways in the coal seam. Just as sailors on land are homesick for the
                  sea, despite all the dangers and difficulties that threaten them, so the
                  mineworker would rather be below ground than above. </p>
            <p> The villages here have something forsaken and still and extinct about them, because
                  life goes on underground instead of above. One could be here for years, but unless
                  one has been down in the mines one has no clear picture of what goes on here. </p>
            <p> The people here are very uneducated and ignorant, and most of them can’t read, yet
                  they’re shrewd and nimble in their difficult work, courageous, of rather small
                  build but squareshouldered, with sombre, deepset eyes. They’re skilled at many
                  things and work amazingly hard. Very nervous dispositions, I mean not weak but
                  sensitive. Have a festering and deeprooted hatred and an innate distrust of anyone
                  who tries to boss them around. With charcoalburners one must have a
                  charcoalburner’s nature and character, and no pretensions, pridefulness or
                  imperiousness, otherwise one can’t get on with them and could never win their
                  trust.Did I tell you at the time about the miner who was badly burned by a gas
                  explosion? Thank God he has now recovered and goes out and about and is beginning
                  to take long walks as practice, his hands are still weak and it will be some time
                  before he’s able to use them for his work, yet he has been saved. But since then
                  there have been quite a few cases of typhus and virulent fever, including what is
                  known as ‘foolish fever’, which causes one to have bad dreams such as nightmares
                  and delirium. So there are again many sickly and bedridden people, lying emaciated
                  on their beds, weak and miserable. </p>
            <p> In one house everyone is sick with fever, and they have little or no help, which
                  means that there the sick are taking care of the sick. ‘Here it is the sick who
                  nurse the sick,’ said the woman, just as it is the poor who befriend the poor. </p>
            <p> Have you seen anything beautiful recently? I’m eagerly longing for a letter from
                  you. </p>
            <p> Has Israëls been working a lot lately, and Maris and Mauve? </p>
            <p> A couple of nights ago a foal was born in the stable here, a nice small creature
                  that was quick to stand firmly on its feet. The workers keep a lot of goats here,
                  and there are young ones in the houses everywhere, just like the rabbits commonly
                  to be found in the workers’ houses. </p>
            <p> Must go out and visit the sick, so have to finish now, let me hear from you soon, to
                  give a sign of life, should you have the time. </p>
            <p> Give my regards to your housemates, and to Mauve when you get the chance, I wish you
                  the very best, and believe me ever, with a handshake in thought, </p>
      </body>

      <ps>
            <p>Going down in a mine is an unpleasant business, in a kind of basket or cage like a
                  bucket in a well, but then a well 500700 metres deep, so that down there, looking
                  upward, the daylight appears to be about as big as a star in the sky. One has a
                  feeling similar to one’s first time on a ship at sea, but worse, though
                  fortunately it doesn’t last long. The workers get used to it, but even so, they
                  never shake off an unconquerable feeling of horror and dread that stays with them,
                  not without reason or unjustifiably. Once down there, however, it isn’t so bad,
                  and the effort is richly rewarded by what one sees.</p>
