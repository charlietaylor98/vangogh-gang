    <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
    <body>
        <p>On Monday morning I’ll leave Helvoirt for Paris, passing through Brussels at 2:07. Do
            come to the station if you can; it would give me great pleasure. Before I forget,
            yesterday I showed your portrait to Mrs Tersteeg, and she would like very much to have
            one. Would you have a chance to get another one and send it to me? If you can’t do it
            now, try to think of it some other time.</p>
        <p>Theo, you have no idea how <unstress reason = "environment">kind to me they all are here</unstress>; you can imagine how sorry I am
            to have to part from so many friends.</p>
    </body>

    <close>Adieu, old chap, give my warm regards to Uncle and Aunt. Goodbye for now. </close>
    <sig>Vincent. </sig>
    <ps>
        <p>Find out whether you have to be at the Station du Nord or du Midi.</p>
    </ps>
