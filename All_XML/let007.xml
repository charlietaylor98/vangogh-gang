    <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
    <body>
        <p>You mustn’t take it amiss, old chap, that I didn’t remember your birthday. Many
            congratulations; I hope that things will continue to go well for you this year, and that
            you’ll take more and more pleasure in your work. </p>
        <p>My time is drawing to a close. On Saturday I’ll go home and take my leave, and then on
            Sunday on to Paris. I’m afraid it’ll end up being Monday, however, and that on Sunday
            I’ll still be in Helvoirt. I hope I’ll be able to write to you in time about when I’ll
            be passing through Brussels, but it’s quite possible that I won’t be able to, as I don’t
            yet know for sure when I have to be in Paris at the latest. </p>
        <p>How are Uncle and Aunt? Have they moved yet? Be sure to write to me soon about that, I’ll
            give you my address below. <stress reason  = "career">I’m writing in haste, as you can imagine I’m busy</stress>. Adieu, I
            wish you well. Give my warm regards to Uncle and Aunt, also to Mr Schmidt and
            Eduard.</p>
    </body>
    <close>Ever your loving brother</close>
