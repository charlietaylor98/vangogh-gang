    <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation> 
    <body>
        <p>Herewith the book about Michel that I promised you, <work origin="new" stage="sketch">also an etching after the
    Margaret by Scheffer and a lithograph after Corot</work>, and a package of chocolate. I do know that
    things aren’t easy for you at the moment, old chap, but remain steadfast and be brave; ‘Not to
    dream, not to sigh’ is also necessary sometimes. You know ‘that you are not alone but that the
    Father is with you’. <unstress reason="friendship">I shake your hand heartily in thought.</unstress></p>
    </body>
    <close>Ever,</close>
    <sig>Your loving brother Vincent</sig>
    <ps><p>Please keep the enclosed etching after Rembrandt, along with the photos of the Corot and
    the Jules Breton sent previously, until Pa and Ma are comfortably settled in Etten, and send
    them then, at the end of November for example. </p></ps>
