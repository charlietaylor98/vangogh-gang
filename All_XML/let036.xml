  <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
  <body>
    <p>I’d rather that you were out of The Hague. Don’t you sometimes long for that as well? Write
      and tell me, yes or no? I’m staying here for the time being, and will probably not go to
      Holland before the autumn.</p>
    <p>In the first crate going to The Hague you’ll find a package for Helvoirt. Please send it on
      after looking at what’s inside. There are a few lithographs &amp;c. which I’d like to see in
      Pa’s study with the ‘Funeral in the cornfield’ by Van der Maaten. Anker’s painting of ‘An old
      Huguenot’, a photo of which is in the package in question, I sold to Uncle Vincent, who was
      here a couple of days ago. He also bought a beautiful painting by Jacque, horses pulling a
      plough in the rain.</p>
    <p>There was a sale here of drawings by Millet, I don’t know whether I’ve already written to you
      about it. When I entered the room in Hôtel Drouot where they were exhibited, I felt something
      akin to: Put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy
      ground. You know that Millet lived in Gréville. Well, I don’t know whether it was Gréville or
      Granville where the man I once told you about died. At any rate, I looked at Millet’s drawings
      of ‘The cliffs at Gréville’ with redoubled attention. A painting of his, ‘The church of
      Gréville’, is now in the Luxembourg. </p>
