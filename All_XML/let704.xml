  <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>

    <p>Letter from Gauguin, who tells me that he’s sent you
  a consignment of paintings and studies. Would be very pleased if you could find the time to write
  and give me some details of what they are. His letter was accompanied by a letter from Bernard, to
  say that they’d received my consignment of canvases, that they’re going to keep all 7 of them.
  Bernard will make another study for me in exchange, and the three others, Moret, Laval and a young
  chap, will also send portraits, I hope. Gauguin has my portrait, and Bernard says that he’d like
  to have one like it, although he already has one of me, which I exchanged with him at the time for
  the portrait of his Grandmother. And it pleased me that they weren’t averse to what I had done in
  figure painting.</p> 
  <p>I was, and still am, almost knocked out by last week’s work. I still can’t do
  anything, but in any case there’s a very violent mistral, which raises clouds of dust that turns
  the trees on boulevard des Lices white from top to bottom. So I’m pretty well forced to take it
  easy. I’ve just slept for 16 hours at a stretch, which has gone a long way to making me myself
  again. And tomorrow I’ll have got over this exhaustion. But I made a good week of it, eh, <work origin="existing" stage="finished">with 5
  canvases;</work> if it gets a bit of its own back this week, well, it’s natural. If I’d worked more
  calmly, you can see clearly that the mistral would have caught me out again. Ah, if the weather’s
  fine here you have to take advantage of it, otherwise you’d never do anything.</p> 
  <p>But tell me what
  Seurat’s doing. If you see him, tell him on my behalf that <work origin="new" stage="middle">I have in progress a decoration which
  at present amounts to 15 square no.</work> 30 canvases, and which, to make an ensemble, will take at
  least 15 more, and that in this work on a broader scale it’s often the memory of his personality
  and of the visit that we made to his studio to see his beautiful big canvases that gives me
  courage in this task. I’d very much like us to have Seurat’s portrait of himself. I had told
  Gauguin that the reason I had urged him to make an exchange of portraits was because I believed
  that he and Bernard would certainly have made several studies, each of the other. That as that
  wasn’t the case and he had done the portrait especially for me, I didn’t want it as an exchange,
  considering the thing too important. He writes to say that he really does wish me to take it as an
  exchange. His letter is again very complimentary, as I don’t deserve it, let’s pass over it.</p> 
  <p>I’m
  sending you article on Provence which seemed well-written to me. These Félibres are a literary and
  artistic circle: Clovis Hugues, Mistral, others, who write quite good, even sometimes very good
  sonnets in Provençal and sometimes in French. If one day the Félibres stop being unaware of my
  existence, they’ll all visit the little house. I prefer that it not happen before I’ve finished my
  decoration. But loving Provence as whole-heartedly as they do, I perhaps have a right to their
  interest. If ever I insist on that right, it will be so that my work remains here or in Marseille,
  where, as you know, I’d like to work, believing that the Marseille artists would do well to
  continue what their Monticelli started. If Gauguin and I write an article in one of the papers
  here, that will be enough to make contact.</p>
