      <salutation>My dear Theo, </salutation>
      <body>
            <p>When in doubt, it’s better to abstain — that, I believe, is what I said in the letter
                  to Gauguin, and that’s what I believe now, having read his reply. If he, for his
                  part, returns to the proposal — he’s perfectly free to return to it — but we’d
                  look I’m not quite sure what, if for the moment we pressed the point, to make him
                  say yes. You see that I’ve received your letter; I thank you very much for it and
                  there were many things in it, I thank you very much for the 100-franc note — as
                  for the delay with the telegram, it was dated Sunday, so it’s the postman’s fault,
                  but it hardly mattered, since the coach for Saintes-Maries leaves every day. <stress reason = "money">But
                  what stopped me was the need to buy canvases and pay the rent.</stress> I have already
                  mentioned to you that I didn’t like Tasset’s canvas very much for outdoor work. In
                  future I think we’ll take the ordinary kind. I bought 50 francs’ worth of canvas
                  with stretching frames — also because I need stretching frames of different sizes
                  to stretch canvases on, even though I’ll send them to you rolled up. They’re the
                  rather large sizes, 30, 25, 20, 15, all square. It seems to me that the large
                  sizes (after all, it’s not very large) suit me better. But I speak about what you
                  write in your letter. I congratulate you on having the Monet exhibition at your
                  premises, and I much regret not seeing it. It will certainly do Tersteeg no harm
                  to have seen this exhibition; he’ll still come round to it, but as your idea was
                  too, very late. It’s indeed curious that he’s changed his mind on the subject of
                  Zola. I know from experience that he couldn’t bear to hear him spoken about. What
                  an odd character Tersteeg is; we shouldn’t give up hope with him — the splendid
                  thing about him is that however rigid and fixed his opinions may be, once he has
                  acknowledged that something is in fact different from what he had imagined — as
                  with Zola — then he changes and becomes bold for the cause. Unfortunately, we
                  don’t get to be old in modern times, and Mr Tersteeg has lived longer now than he
                  still has to live. And where is his successor? My God, what a sad thing it is that
                  you and he are not entirely as one in business matters these days. But what can
                  you say — it’s what I believe they call a fatality. You were fortunate to meet Guy
                  de Maupassant — I’ve just read his first book, Des vers, poems dedicated to his
                  master, Flaubert. There’s one, ‘Au bord de l’eau’, that’s already him. So you see,
                  what Vermeer of Delft is beside Rembrandt among painters, he is among French
                  novelists beside Zola. In short, Tersteeg’s visit isn’t at all what I’d dared
                  hope, and I make no secret of it to myself that I miscalculated the odds on his
                  cooperating. And perhaps on the business with Gauguin, too. Let’s take a look at
                  that: I thought he was at bay and I blame myself for having money and the pal who
                  works better than I, not — I say, he’s entitled to half if he wishes. But — if
                  Gauguin isn’t at bay, then I’m not in too much of a hurry. </p>

            <p>And I categorically withdraw from it, and the only question for me remains quite
                  simply this: If I looked for a pal to work with, would I be doing the right thing,
                  would this be more beneficial to my brother and me, would the pal lose or would he
                  gain by it? So these, then, are questions that certainly preoccupy me, but which
                  need to come face to face with reality in order to become actual facts. I don’t
                  wish to discuss Gauguin’s plan, having considered the situation once — last winter
                  — you know the results. You know that I believe that an association of the
                  Impressionists would be something along the lines of the associations of the 12
                  English Pre-Raphaelites, and that I believe that it could come into being. That
                  I’m therefore inclined to believe that the artists would guarantee their
                  livelihood amongst themselves, mutually, and independently of the dealers, each
                  agreeing to give a substantial number of paintings to the society, and that
                  earnings as well as losses would be shared. I don’t believe that this society
                  would last indefinitely, but I believe that during its lifetime we would live
                  courageously and would produce. <stress reason = "environment">But if tomorrow Gauguin and his banker Jews come
                  and ask me for nothing but 10 paintings for a society of dealers and not a society
                  of artists, well, I don’t know if I’d trust them — I who would be glad, on the
                  other hand, to give 50 to a society of artists. </stress>Isn’t it a bit the way it was with
                  Reid — why say that Gabriel de la Roquette’s a scoundrel if you do the same
                  yourself? Why say artistic Society if it’s made up of bankers? Enough, for
                  Heaven’s sake, let our pal do as his heart tells him, <stress reason = "career">but his plan is far from
                  making me enthusiastic.</stress> I prefer things as they are — to take them the way it is,
                  without changing anything about them, to half-baked reforms. The great revolution,
                  art for the artists, my God, perhaps it’s a utopia, and too bad, then. </p>
            <p> I think life’s so short and goes by so fast. Now, being a painter you have to paint,
                  all the same. And you’re also well aware that because at that time — last winter
                  with Pissarro and the others, we happened to talk about it a lot, I’m now making a
                  big effort to add nothing more except this, that speaking for myself, before next
                  year I want to make my contribution of 50 paintings. If I manage to do that then
                  I’ll stick to my opinion. I’ve sent you <work mention = "vague">3 drawings by post today</work>.</p>
            <p>The one with the wheat stacks in a farmyard will seem too bizarre to you, but it was
                  done in great haste as a project for a painting, and it’s to show you what it’s
                  like. Now, the harvest is a bit more serious. And that’s the subject I’ve been
                  working on this week, on a no. 30 canvas — it’s hardly done at all — but it kills
                  the rest of what I have, apart from a still life, worked on with patience.
                  Macknight and one of his friends who’s been in Africa too saw this study today and
                  said it was the best I’d done. Like Anquetin and our friend Thomas — you’re really
                  not sure what to think of yourself when you hear people say that, but I say to
                  myself: the rest must look bloody awful, to be sure. Well then — on days when I
                  bring back a study I say to myself, if it was like this every day things could
                  work — but on days when you come home empty-handed and you eat and spend money all
                  the same, you don’t feel content with yourself, and you feel like a madman, a
                  scoundrel or an old fool. And dear old Doctor Ox, I mean our Swede, Mourier, I
                  liked him well enough because, with his spectacles, he went naїvely and benignly
                  about this wicked world, and because I presumed he had a heart that was purer than
                  many a heart, and even with more of a leaning towards rectitude than many of the
                  cleverest people have. And as I knew he hadn’t been painting for very long it made
                  not a bit of difference to me that his work was the very height of inanity. And I
                  saw him every day for months. All right. So what can be the reason for his losing
                  his qualities? This is how I imagine the case to be. Bear in mind that he came to
                  the south to get over a nervous disorder caused by a whole lot of problems he’s
                  had, and as a result of which he changed career. </p>
            <p> He was perfectly well here, he was very calm, &amp;c. But the shock of Paris was too
                  great, the change too sudden, he didn’t find the Paris of his dreams, and there he
                  is, worried and perhaps disagreeable, and in any case doing silly things. He’ll
                  soon have sown his wild oats, I hope. While waiting, let him do whatever he likes
                  without attaching any importance to it. He’s placing huge hopes in Russell (I
                  believe), he’s looking for an adviser and a teacher — now — no need to tell you
                  that Russell will perhaps not be everything he needs, but I believe that Russell
                  will see that he’s someone who doesn’t know the circles of people with whom he’s
                  dealing, and I think that Russell will take him seriously and will try to be good
                  for him. I believe that Russell is making a name for himself among those who have
                  an instinctive fear of Paris. It’s hard to explain what I mean by that. Russell is
                  such a good man — but you know, you can’t recommend that people love Paris, or
                  force them to, any more than you can recommend a pipe or black coffee with cognac.
                  And Russell’s rich and has lost money in Paris, so he can and does say to people:
                  ‘see what I’ve had to deal with’. But in any event, I’ll write a word to Russell.
                  It seems that Macknight wasn’t very pleased with me but that Russell indicated to
                  him in reply that he should shut up. All this to tell you I understand very, very
                  well — seeing he has turned out like that — that you’re not in complete agreement
                  with the Swede, who probably, according to what you write, has had a recurrence of
                  his nervous trouble and is irritated by Paris. If he has money to waste in taking
                  a studio like Gérôme’s, it would be serious. As I’m slightly doubtful that he has
                  a huge amount to waste, he’s in for a bit of a drubbing that’s not undeserved, I’d
                  say. There’s nothing to be done if he won’t listen, but you can’t live with him. I
                  won’t write to Gauguin direct — I’ll send you the letter — because when in doubt,
                  it’s better to abstain. IF WE SAY NO MORE, if the reply shows we’ve said something
                  like that but that there has to be an initiative in the matter from his side too,
                  then we’ll see if he’s keen on it. If he isn’t keen on it, if it’s all one to him,
                  if he has something quite different in mind, let him remain independent, and me
                  too. Handshake to you and to Mourier.</p>
      </body>

      <close>Ever yours, </close>
      <sig>Vincent</sig>

      <ps>
            <p>I find this in particular rather strange in this plan of Gauguin’s: the society
                  offers its protection in exchange for 10 paintings that the artists will have to
                  give, if ten artists do that, the Jewish company clearly pockets 100 paintings
                  ‘for a start’. The protection of this society that doesn’t even exist costs a lot
                  of money. </p>


            <p>Here’s the letter for Gauguin — I’m well aware that in his there is this passage ‘I
                  ask (underlined) if, the capital having been raised for the most part, your
                  brother would use his efforts to make a success of the business and to be its
                  director’. I’m well aware that he also writes, ‘I accept your proposal in
                  principle’. But I believe that it could lead us too far if we weren’t a little
                  firm in showing him that our proposal was without all these afterthoughts, and
                  that we ourselves<stress reason = "money"> are too hard up to be able to risk anything other than setting
                  up house together and sharing the month’s money</stress>. And it’s true I didn’t know he
                  had so large a family; he’ll more likely wish to stay in the north for that
                  reason. The most radical thing we could do would be for me to give up the south,
                  and if that would get him out of trouble, go and join him in Brittany myself. And
                  the desire I have to work in the south is naturally subordinate to the interests
                  of people like him. All the same, we shouldn’t change lightly. </p>
            <p>And I’m a little afraid of getting a dressing-down for having separated him from his
                  family, or a hornet’s nest like that. Dear God, if he has such a large family his
                  obligations are probably not to be absent from them any more. And perhaps he’d be
                  much happier if you simply bought a painting from him from time to time. </p>
            <p>If now I haven’t mentioned these two passages and other passages in his letter it’s
                  because it seems far too difficult to me to say yes to that in all honesty.
                  However, if it was the case that his whole plan is nothing but a fata Morgana, and
                  as such will vanish, he’ll speak of it again of his own accord. But there’s the
                  fare, the debt at the inn, the doctor’s bill; now he’s talking about another debt
                  of 300 francs which he’ll settle with that painting if his collector agrees. But
                  if he doesn’t agree? Well now, it wouldn’t be very prudent to give him hopes
                  beyond our resources and commit ourselves to doing more than we could stick to.
                  It’s all very well for Gauguin to say, he’s very very upset and it’s a pity, and
                  it can’t be good for his work. No, we shouldn’t change what we’ve said and
                  consider that the thing isn’t going ahead because of doubts and changes whose
                  presence isn’t a good sign. <unstress reason = "career">The more I calm myself here and the more I regain my
                  strength, the more I feel that work is the most secure thing</unstress>. I admit that if
                  living in <stress reason = "money">Brittany is much less expensive, if necessary I must sacrifice my plan
                  to work here, and I’ll do it willingly if it’s to his benefit</stress>. But all the more
                  reason to work hard on the 50 paintings I wished to have before talking again
                  about projects of the kind we discussed last winter. A letter from home arrives
                  just now. You know I feel so well now that it isn’t indispensable that I stay here
                  for my health alone. We have to act so that you aren’t completely overwhelmed by
                  expenses, that’s what’s necessary and that’s serious enough in itself. </p>
