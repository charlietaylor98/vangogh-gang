  <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation> 
  <body>
    <p>Herewith what I promised. You’ll like the book by Jules Breton. There’s one
  poem of his that I found especially moving: ‘Illusions’. Blessed are those whose hearts are thus
  attuned. All things work together for good to them that love God is a beautiful saying. It will be
  so for you, too; and the aftertaste of these difficult days will be good. But write and tell me
  soon how things are and when the doctor says you’ll be better, if you haven’t done so already,
  that is. In a fortnight I hope to be in Etten, <unstress reason="environment">you can imagine how much I’m looking forward to it.</unstress>
  Have I already told you that I’ve taken up pipe-smoking &amp;c. again? I’ve rediscovered in my
  pipe an old, trusty friend, and I imagine we’ll never part again. I heard from Uncle Vincent that
  you smoke too.</p> 
    <p>Tell everyone at the Rooses’ especially that I bid them good-day; you and I have
  had a lot of good times in their house, and have met with much loyalty. We have ‘Sunday morning’
  by Emile Breton here at present. You know it, don’t you? It’s a village street with farmhouses and
  sheds, and at the end the church surrounded by poplars. Everything covered with snow and little
  black figures going to church. <unstress reason="environment">It tells us that winter is cold but that there are warm human
  hearts.</unstress></p>
  </body> 
  <close>I wish you the very best, old boy, and believe me ever</close>
  <sig>Your loving brother Vincent</sig>
  <ps><p>The packages of chocolate marked X are for you, the other two are for Mrs Roos. Smoke the cigarettes
  with your housemates. Adieu.</p></ps>
