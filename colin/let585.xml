      <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
      <p>I thank you very much for your letter, which I hadn’t even dared to expect so soon as
            regards the 50franc note you included with it. I see you’ve had no response yet from
            Tersteeg — I don’t see the need to press the point from our end in a new letter —
            however, if you had some official business to transact with the firm of Boussod Valadon
            &amp; Cie in The Hague you could make it clear in a P.S. that you’re quite surprised
            that he hasn’t let you know that he received the letter in question. As far as work
            goes, I brought home <work origin = "existing">a no.15 canvas</work> today, it’s a drawbridge, with a little carriage
            going across it, outlined against a blue sky — the river blue as well, the banks orange
            with greenery, a group of washerwomen wearing blouses and multicoloured bonnets. And
            another landscape with a little rustic bridge and washerwomen as well. Lastly an avenue
            of plane trees near the station. 12 studies altogether since I’ve been here. The
            weather’s changeable, often windy and cloudy skies — but the almond trees are starting
            to blossom everywhere.<unstress reason = "environment"> All in all I’m very pleased that the paintings are at the
            Independents</unstress>. </p>
      <p>You’ll do well to go and see Signac at his place. <unstress reason = "friendship">I was very pleased at what you wrote in
            today’s letter</unstress>, that he made a better impression on you than the first time. In any case
           <unstress reason = "friendship"> I’m happy to know that from today you won’t be on your own in the apartment</unstress>. Be sure to
            say hello to Koning for me. Is your health good? As far as mine goes, <unstress reason = "environment">it’s better</unstress>, but
            eating’s a real chore as I have a fever and no appetite, but it’s just a passing thing
            and a question of patience. I have company in the evening, because the young Danish
            painter who’s here is very nice; his work is dry, correct and timid, but I’m not averse
            to that when the person is young and intelligent. At one time he’d begun to study
            medicine, he knows the works of Zola, De Goncourt and Guy de Maupassant, and he has
            enough money to have an easy time of it. Besides that he has a very serious wish to do
            something different from what he’s doing at present. I think he’d do well to put off
            returning home for a year, or to come back after a short visit to his compatriots. But,
            my dear brother — you know, I feel I’m in Japan. I say no more than that, and again,
            I’ve seen nothing yet in its usual splendour. That’s why (even while being worried that
            at the moment expenses are steep and the paintings of no value), <unstress reason = "environment">that’s why I don’t
            despair of success</unstress> in this enterprise of going on a long journey in the south. Here I’m
            seeing new things, I’m learning, and being treated with a bit of gentleness, <good_health>my body
            isn’t refusing me its services</good_health>. For many reasons I’d like to be able to create a
            piedàterre which, when people were exhausted, could be used to provide a rest in the
            country for poor Paris cabhorses like yourself and several of our friends, the poor
            Impressionists. I attended the inquiry into a crime committed at the door of a brothel
            here; two Italians killed two Zouaves. I took advantage of the opportunity to go into
            one of the brothels in the little street called ‘des Récollets’. Which is the limit of
            my amorous exploits visàvis the Arlésiennes. The crowd almost (the southerner, following
            Tartarin’s example, being braver in good intentions than in action), the crowd, I’m
            telling you, almost lynched the murderers locked up in the town hall, but its revenge
            was that all the Italians, men and women, including the young chimneysweeps, had to
            leave the town under duress. </p>
      <p>I wouldn’t talk to you about that if it weren’t to tell you that I’ve seen the boulevards
            of this town full of excited people. And really, that was quite beautiful. I made my
            last three studies with the help of the perspective frame you know about. I attach
            importance to the use of the frame, because it doesn’t seem unlikely to me that several
            artists will use it in the not too distant future, just as the old German and Italian
            painters, certainly, and, I’m inclined to believe, the Flemish artists too, used it. The
            modern use of this tool may differ from the use people made of it in the past — but —
            isn’t it also true that with the process of painting in oils we nowadays achieve very
            different effects from those of the inventors of the process, J. and Hubert van Eyck?
            This is to say that I still hope not to work for myself alone. I believe in the absolute
            necessity of a new art of colour, of drawing and — of the artistic life. And if we work
            in that faith, it seems to me that there’s a chance that our hopes won’t be in vain.
            You’ll still know that I’m in a position to send you some studies if need be, only it’s
            still impossible to roll them up. I shake your hand firmly. On Sunday I’ll write to
            Bernard and Lautrec because I solemnly promised to. Anyway, I’ll send you the letters.
            I’m really sorry about Gauguin’s situation, especially since, now that his health has
            been undermined, he no longer has a constitution that could only benefit from being put
            to the test, on the contrary, it will just wear him out now, and that will surely make
            it difficult for him to work. More soon. </p>
      <close>Ever yours, </close>
