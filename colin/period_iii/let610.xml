      <salutation>My dear Theo, </salutation>
      <body>
            <p>Thanks for your letter containing 100 francs. I’m very glad to have left those
                  people’s place, <good_health>and my health is much better since</good_health>. It was their bad food more
                  than anything that made it drag on, and their wine, which was real poison. I now
                  eat very well for one franc or 1.50 francs. Tasset’s absorbent canvas would be
                  just the thing for me if the canvas itself was three times as coarse. If you run
                  into that gentleman see if you can find out what he uses as primer. It wouldn’t
                  surprise me if his canvas is prepared with pipeclay. If I had information about it
                  I think I’d prepare the canvas myself. It’s not urgent — but see what you can find
                  out. I still have 4 metres of canvas 1 metre 20 wide that I bought here, but it
                  isn’t prepared yet. As soon as there’d be another consignment of colours, he could
                  add primer to that consignment, enough to prepare 4 metres. But anyway, it’s not
                  urgent yet. </p>
            <p>On your return did those gentlemen speak again about making you travel? In the next
                  few days you’ll see the Danish painter who was here arrive in Paris, I don’t know
                  how to write his name (Moriés?). He’s going to see the Salon and will then go back
                  to his country and come back to the south, in a year perhaps. His last three
                  studies were better and more colourful than what he was doing before. I don’t know
                  what he’ll do later. But he has a good character and I’m sorry he’s going away. I
                  told him a Dutch painter was living with you, and if Koning would like to take him
                  up the Butte Montmartre he’ll probably do some studies there. I’ve talked to him a
                  lot about the Impressionists, all of whom he knew by name or from having seen
                  their paintings, and he’s very interested in the subject. He has a letter of
                  introduction to Russell. He regained his health here and is now very well — he’s
                  good for two years — but after that it would do him good to come back for this
                  same reason of health. What’s this new book on Daumier, L’homme et l’oeuvre? Have
                  you seen the exhibition of the caricaturists? </p>
            <p><work origin = "new" stage="finished">I have two new studies, a bridge and the verge of a wide road.</work> Many of the subjects
                  here are just — in character — the same as in Holland — the difference is in the
                  colour. There’s sulphur everywhere where the sun beats down. You know that we saw
                  a magnificent rose garden by Renoir. I imagined I would find similar subjects
                  here, and that was indeed the case when the orchards were in blossom. Now the
                  appearance of things has changed and nature has become much harsher. But what
                  greenness and what a blue! I must say that the few landscapes by Cézanne that I
                  know render it very, very well, and I regret not having seen more of them. The
                  other day I saw a subject just like Monticelli’s beautiful landscape with the
                  poplars that we saw at Reid’s. To find more of Renoir’s gardens you’d probably
                  have to go towards Nice. I’ve seen very few roses here, although there are some,
                  among others the big red roses they call Roses de Provence. </p>
            <p>To find plenty of subjects is perhaps already something in itself. Provided the
                  paintings are worth what they cost. If the Impressionists go up in value that may
                  become the case. And after a few years’ work we could recoup the past to some
                  extent. And after a year I’ll have a quiet home of my own. I’m curious about what
                  you’ll say about my consignment, I think it takes 10 days to go from here to Paris
                  by goods train. If the consignment includes some that are too poor, don’t show
                  them. The reason I sent you the whole lot is that it will give you an idea of the
                  things I’ve seen. I need to go and look for a new subject, so thanking you very
                  warmly for writing to me so soon, handshake to you and to Koning.</p>
