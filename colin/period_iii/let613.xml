      <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
      <body>
            <p>I read an announcement in L’Intransigeant that there’s going to be an exhibition of
                  the Impressionists at Durand-Ruel — there’ll be some works by Caillebotte —I’ve
                  never seen anything of his, and wanted to ask you to write and tell me what
                  they’re like — there are certainly other noteworthy things too. I sent you <work mention="vague">some
                  more drawings today, and I’m adding two more</work>. They’re views taken from a rocky
                  hill from which you can see in the direction of the Crau (an area from which a
                  very good wine comes), the town of Arles and in the direction of Fontvieille. The
                  contrast between the wild and romantic foreground — and the broad, tranquil
                  distant prospects with their horizontal lines, shading off until they reach the
                  chain of the Alpilles — so famous for the great feats of climbing of Tartarin,
                  P.C.A., and the Alpine Club. <unstress reason = "environment">This contrast is very picturesque</unstress>. The two drawings
                  that I’m now adding afterwards will give you an idea of the ruin that crowns the
                  rocks. But is it worth the trouble of making frames for this Dordrecht exhibition?
                  I find it so silly and I’d prefer not to be part of it. I prefer to believe that
                  Bernard or Gauguin will exchange drawings with us in which the Dutch will see
                  nothing. Have you met the Dane Mourier-Petersen — he’ll have brought you another
                  two drawings as well. </p>

            <p>He studied to be a doctor, but I suppose he was discouraged in that by the student
                  life, discouraged by both his pals and his professors. He never said anything to
                  me about it, though, except that he once declared: ‘but doctors kill people’. When
                  he came here he was suffering from a nervous condition that came from the strain
                  of the examinations. How long has he been doing painting — I don’t know — he’s
                  certainly made little progress as a painter, but he’s good as a pal and he looks
                  at people and often judges them very accurately. Could there be a possible
                  arrangement whereby he could come to live with you? As far as intelligence goes, I
                  think he’d be far more preferable to that Lacoste, of whom I don’t think highly, I
                  don’t know why. You’ve absolutely no need of 6th-rate Dutchmen or worse, who when
                  going back to their country do nothing but say and do idiotic things. A dealer in
                  paintings is, unfortunately, more or less a public figure. Anyway, there’s no
                  serious harm done. The Swede is from a good family, he has order and regularity in
                  his means of support, and as a man he makes me think of those characters Pierre
                  Loti creates. For all that he’s phlegmatic, he has a good heart. </p>
            <p>I plan to do a lot more drawing. It’s already jolly hot, I can assure you. I must add
                  an order for colours to this letter — however, if you’d prefer not to get them
                  immediately I’d do a few more drawings and wouldn’t lose anything by it. I’ll also
                  divide the order into two according to what would be more urgent or less. What’s
                  always urgent is to draw, and whether it’s done directly with a brush, or with
                  something else, such as a pen, you never do enough. I’m trying now to exaggerate
                  the essence of things, and to deliberately leave vague what’s commonplace.</p>
            <p>I’m delighted that you’ve bought the book on Daumier — but if you could add to that
                  by buying some more of his lithographs that would be absolutely good — because in
                  the future Daumiers won’t be easy to get hold of. How’s your health, have you seen
                  père Gruby again? I’m inclined to believe he exaggerates your heart condition a
                  bit, to the detriment of the need to treat you rigorously for your nervous system.
                  Well, he’ll certainly realize it as you follow his treatment; with Gruby you’ll
                  last, but unfortunately for us père Gruby himself won’t last, because he’s getting
                  old and when we need him the most he won’t be there any more. I’m thinking more
                  and more that we shouldn’t judge the Good Lord by this world, because it’s one of
                  his studies that turned out badly. But what of it, in failed studies — when you’re
                  really fond of the artist — you don’t find much to criticize — you keep quiet. But
                  we’re within our rights to ask for something better. We’d have to see other works
                  by the same hand though. This world was clearly cobbled together in haste, in one
                  of those bad moments when its author no longer knew what he was doing, and didn’t
                  have his wits about him. What legend tells us about the Good Lord is that he went
                  to enormous trouble over this study of his for a world. I’m inclined to believe
                  that the legend tells the truth, but then the study is worked to death in several
                  ways. It’s only the great masters who make such mistakes; that’s perhaps the best
                  consolation, as we’re then within our rights to hope to see revenge taken by the
                  same creative hand. And — then — this life — criticized so much and for such good,
                  even excellent reasons — we — shouldn’t take it for anything other than it is, and
                  we’ll be left with the hope of seeing better than that in another life. Handshake
                  to you and to Koning. </p>

            <p>I hope to have news from you tomorrow, otherwise <stress reason = "money">I’d be in quite a tight corner as I
                  only have money left for tomorrow, Sunday</stress>. Have you received the crate at long
                  last? It doesn’t much surprise me that it takes time, though, as the crate had to
                  be transported from one station to another — but — all the same. </p>
