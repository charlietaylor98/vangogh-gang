      <salutation>My dear Theo</salutation>
      <body>
            <p>Many thanks for your letter, <unstress reason = "friendship">which gave me great pleasure</unstress>, coming just at the moment
                  when I was still dazed by the sun and the strain of handling a rather large
                  canvas.<work stage = "finished" origin="new"> I have a new drawing of a garden full of flowers</work>; <work stage="finished" origin = "new">I also have two painted
                  studies of it</work>. I must send you a rather large new order for canvas and colours.
                  Only it’s not at all urgent. What, if anything, would be urgent would rather be
                  the canvas, seeing that I have a whole lot of stretching frames from which I’ve
                  removed the studies, and on which in the meantime I must put other canvases. </p>




            <p>You’ll see from this croquis the subject of the new studies; there’s one vertical and
                  one horizontal one of the same subject — no. 30 canvases. There’s definitely a
                  subject for a painting among them — as in some other studies that I have. And
                  truly, I don’t know if I’ll ever do tranquil and calmly worked paintings, myself,
                  as it seems to me that it will always remain disjointed. Have you any news from
                  Gauguin? I wrote to him again last week, to know how it was going with his health
                  and his work. No reply from Russell, who’s probably not in Paris, judging by what
                  Macknight was saying, who has come back with Boch. Still icy silence about the
                  work when they come. What you say about Princenhage, it’s true that it’s the same
                  story all over again — but when at long last the fellow isn’t there any more, then
                  for his little circle it will be one more emptiness and desolation. And even the
                  rest of us would feel it, because there’s something heartbreaking in the fact that
                  when we were younger we saw so much of him, and we were even influenced by him. </p>
            <p>So, seeing someone whom one has known as very active reduced to that state of
                  suspicious helplessness and constant suffering, it certainly doesn’t give you an
                  appealing or cheerful notion of human life, and doesn’t add to the joy of living.
                  Our mother in Breda, she must be getting on a bit, too. Without meaning to — is it
                  the effect of nature down here, so Ruisdaelesque? — I quite often think of
                  Holland, and with the double separation of distance and time that has passed,
                  these memories have something heartbreaking about them. What you write about Reid
                  isn’t very cheerful either — at times he used to speak so often of making himself
                  a painter, and of retiring to live with an aunt in the country, that it’s just
                  possible that he’s carrying out this plan now. What does Maria say? But perhaps
                  she’s disappeared too. I believe all the same that the constant wind here must
                  have something to do with the fact that the painted studies have that wild look.
                  Because you also see it in Cézanne. </p>
            <p>What must make it easier for the Japanese to stuff their works of art into drawers
                  and cupboards is that you can roll kakemonos but not our painted studies, which
                  would eventually flake. Nothing would make it easier for us to place our canvases
                  than to get them widely accepted as decorations in bourgeois homes. As in Holland
                  in the old days. And here in the south it would do a hell of a lot of good to see
                  paintings on the white walls. But go and look: big, coloured Julien medallions
                  everywhere — horrors. And alas, we won’t change anything in this state of affairs.
                  However — cafés — perhaps we’ll decorate them later on. More soon, handshake.</p>
