      <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
      <body>
            <p>I’m writing you another few lines to tell you that I’ve been to see the gentleman
                  whom the Arab Jew in Tartarin calls ‘the shustish of the beace’. I still got 12
                  francs back and my host was reprimanded for keeping my trunk; as I wasn’t refusing
                  to pay, he had no right to hold it. If they’d found in favour of the other party,
                  that would have done me harm, because he wouldn’t have failed to go around saying
                  that I had not been able or not been willing to pay him, and that he’d been forced
                  to take my trunk. Whereas now — because I left at the same time as him — he said
                  as we went that he’d been angry but hadn’t really wished to insult me. But that’s
                  just what he was trying to do, probably seeing that I had seen enough of his shack
                  — and that he couldn’t make me stay — he’d have gone to tell tales where I am at
                  the moment. All right. If I’d wanted to get the actual reduction, I’d probably
                  have claimed more in damages, for example. If I let myself be annoyed by just
                  anybody I’d soon not know where to turn, you understand. </p>
            <p>I’ve found a better restaurant where I eat for 1 franc. <good_health>My health’s been better these
                  days. </good_health>Now I have <work origin = "existing" stage = "finished">two new studies like this</work>:</p>



            <p>You already have a drawing of it, a farmhouse beside the wide road in the
                  wheatfields. </p>


            <p>A meadow full of very yellow buttercups, a ditch with iris plants with green leaves,
                  with purple flowers, the town in the background, some grey willow trees — a strip
                  of blue sky. </p>
            <p> If they don’t mow the meadow I’d like to do this study again, because the subject
                  matter was really beautiful and I had trouble finding the composition. A little
                  town surrounded by countryside entirely covered in yellow and purple flowers. That
                  would really be a Japanese dream, you know. Having asked the price for sending the
                  consignment that went off by goods train, it will be 7 francs at the station in
                  Paris. As I don’t have very much left I didn’t put postage on it here — but if
                  they asked more you’d have to complain. The crate is marked UV and W1042. We’ve
                  had the mistral again yesterday and today. I hope my consignment arrives before
                  Tersteeg comes to Paris. Handshake, write to me soon.</p>
