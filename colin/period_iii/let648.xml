  <salutation>My dear Theo, </salutation>
  <body>
    <p>I’m sending you Gauguin’s letter enclosed herewith; fortunately he’s regaining his health.
      How is yours?</p>
    <p>I’d very much like it if Russell were to do something — however, he has a wife, children, a
      studio, a house under construction, and I can very well imagine that even a rich man may not
      always be able to spend 100 francs — were it only that — on paintings. I believe that it would
      make an enormous difference to me if Gauguin was here,<stress reason = "friendship"> because the days pass now without
      saying a word to anyone</stress>. Ah, well. In any case, his letter gave me tremendous pleasure. <stress reason = "environment">Being
      too long alone in the country you become dull-witted, and not just yet — but this winter, I
      could become sterile from that</stress>. Now this danger will no longer exist if he comes, because we
      won’t be short of ideas. </p>
    <p>If work goes well and if we don’t lack guts, there’s the hope of seeing very interesting
      years in the future. Is Mourier still with you? Would it be possible for me to have your
      letter on Sunday? I’m not counting on it, though, knowing that it’s the end of the month. It’s
      just that I’ll probably have a model this week.</p>
    <p>I have a really great need for some studies of figures. At the moment I have something like
      an exhibition at my place, in the sense that I’ve taken all the studies off the stretching
      frames and have nailed them to the wall to finish drying. You’ll see that when there’s a large
      number of them, and we make a choice among them, it will come to the same thing as if I’d
      studied them more and worked on them longer.<stress reason = "career"> Because to do a subject over and over again on
      the same canvas or on several canvases comes, in short, to the same degree of seriousness. I’m
      somewhat rushed</stress>, so handshake and </p>
