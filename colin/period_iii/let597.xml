      <head>Arles, on or about Friday, 13 April 1888.</head>

      <salutation>My dear Theo, </salutation>
      <body>
            <p>Thanks for your letter containing the samples of absorbent canvas. Will be very glad
                  to receive — but it’s not at all urgent — 3 metres of the sort at 6 francs. As for
                  his consignment of colours, there were only 4 large tubes of white in it, while
                  all the other tubes were half-size (of white). If he has charged for them in the
                  same proportions, that’s very good, but pay attention to that. 4 tubes of white at
                  1 franc, but the rest should only be half the price. I find his Prussian blue
                  poor, and his cinnabar. The rest is good. Now I’ll tell you that <work origin = "new" stage="middle">I’m working on
                  the 2 paintings</work> of which I wanted to make repetitions. The pink peach tree is
                  giving me the most trouble.</p>





            <p>You can see from the four squares on the other side that the three orchards go
                  together, more or less. I now also have a small pear tree, vertical, also flanked
                  by two other horizontal canvases. That will make 6 canvases of orchards in
                  blossom. At the moment I’m trying to finish them a little every day, and to make
                  them go together. I dare hope for 3 more, also going together, but those are still
                  only in the state of embryos or foetuses.</p>
            <p>I’d really like to do this group of 9 canvases. You understand that we’re free to
                  consider the 9 canvases as the initial idea for a much larger, definitive
                  decoration (this one consists of no. 25 and no. 12 canvases), which would be done
                  after exactly the same subjects, at the same time next year. </p>

            <p>Here’s the other middle piece of the no. 12 canvases. The ground purple — in the
                  background a wall, with straight poplars — and a very blue sky. The small pear
                  tree has a purple trunk and white flowers, a large yellow butterfly on one of the
                  clumps. On the left, in the corner, a little garden with a border of yellow reeds
                  and green bushes and a flowerbed. A small pink house.</p>
            <p>So there are the details of the decoration of orchards in blossom, which I was
                  intending for you. But the last 3 canvases exist only in a provisional state, and
                  are supposed to represent a very large orchard with a border of cypresses and
                  large pear trees and apple trees. The ‘Pont de Langlois’ for you is going well,
                  and will be better than the study, I think. Am in a real hurry to get back to
                  work. As for the Guillaumin, if it’s possible, it’s certainly a good deal to buy
                  it. But since they’re talking about a new method for fixing pastel, would perhaps
                  be wise to ask him to fix it in this way, in case of purchase. Handshake to you
                  and to Koning.</p>
      </body>
      <close>Ever yours, </close>

      <ps>
            <p>I’ve had a letter from Bernard with some sonnets that he’s made, some of which are
                  successful; he’ll succeed in making a good sonnet, for which I almost envy him. As
                  soon as the Langlois bridge and the repetition of the other painting (the pink
                  peach tree) are dry, will make a consignment.</p>
