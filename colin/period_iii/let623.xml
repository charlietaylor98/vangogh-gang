    <salutation>My dear Theo, </salutation>
    <body>
        <p>On Monday morning I received your telegraphed money order for 50 francs, for which I
            thank you kindly. But I haven’t yet received your letter, which surprised me a little.
            I’ve received a letter from Gauguin, who said he’d received a letter from you containing
            50 francs, by which he was very touched, and in which you said a few words about the
            plan. As I had sent you my letter to him, he hadn’t yet received the more clear-cut
            proposal when he wrote. But he says that he has the experience that when he was in
            Martinique with his friend Laval, the two of them together managed better than either
            one of them alone, and that he therefore fully agreed on the advantages a life in common
            would have. He says the pains in his bowels are still continuing, and he seems quite
            unhappy to me. He talks about a hope he has of finding capital of six hundred thousand
            francs to set up a dealer in Impressionist paintings, and that he would explain his plan
            and that he’d like you to be at the head of this business. I shouldn’t be surprised if
            that hope is a fata Morgana, a mirage that goes with being broke. The more broke you are
            — especially when you’re ill — the more you think of such possibilities. So I see first
            and foremost in this plan yet another proof that he’s despondent, and that the best
            thing would be get him back on his feet as quickly as possible. </p>
        <p>He says that when sailors have to move a heavy load or raise an anchor, in order to be
            able to lift a greater weight, to be able to make an enormous effort, they all sing
            together to support each other and to give each other energy. That it’s just what
            artists lack. So I’d be really surprised if he weren’t glad to come. But the costs of
            the hotel and the journey are made even more complicated by the doctor’s bill, so it
            will be jolly hard. But it seems to me that he should ditch the debt and leave some
            paintings as security if he’s going to come here, and if the people don’t agree to that,
            leave the debt in the lurch without any paintings as security. Wasn’t I forced to do the
            same thing in order to come to Paris? And although I suffered the loss of many things
            then, it can’t be done otherwise in cases like that, and it’s better to go forward
            anyway than to go on being depressed. I haven’t left for Saintes-Maries — they’ve
            finished painting the house and I had to pay, and I also have to buy quite a
            considerable supply of canvas. And out of the fifty francs I’ve got one louis left and
            we’re only Tuesday morning, and so it was hardly possible for me to leave and I fear it
            won’t yet be possible next week either. </p>
        <p><unstress reason = "friendship">I was pleased to learn that Mourier has come to lodge with you</unstress>. If Gauguin would prefer
            to take the risk of throwing himself back into business at this point — if he really has
            hopes of doing something in Paris — for Heaven’s sake let him go there, but I think he’d
            be wiser to come here for a year at least; I’ve seen someone here who had been to Tonkin
            and was ill when he came back from that delightful region — he recovered here. I have
            two or three new drawings and also 2 or three new painted studies.</p>
        <p>I went to Tarascon one day, unfortunately there was so much sun and dust that day that I
            came home empty-handed. I’ve had reports of 2 Monticellis in Marseille, a bouquet of
            flowers at 250 francs and figures. It was Russell’s friend, Macknight, who had seen them
            there. I’d very much like to go there sometime, to Marseille. I still continue to find
            the subjects here very beautiful and interesting, and despite the vexations of expenses,
            I nevertheless think there’s a better chance in the south than in the north. If you saw
            the Camargue — and many other places — like me, you’d be very surprised to see that it
            has a character absolutely à la Ruisdael. </p>
        <p><unstress reason = "career">I have a new subject on the go</unstress>, green and yellow fields as far as the eye can see, which
            I’ve already drawn twice and am starting again as a painting, just like a Salomon
            Koninck, you know, Rembrandt’s pupil who made the vast flat landscapes. Or it’s like
            something by Michel or like Jules Dupré, but it’s really quite different from rose
            gardens. It’s true that I’ve only visited one part of Provence, and in the other part
            there’s the countryside that Claude Monet does, for example. I’m very curious to know
            what Gauguin will do. He says that in the past he got people to buy Impressionists to
            the tune of 35 thousand at Durand-Ruel’s, and that he hopes to do the same thing again
            for you. But it’s so bad, when you start having trouble with your health you can no
            longer risk sudden impulses, and I think Gauguin’s most solid asset is now his painting,
            and the best business he could do, his own paintings. It’s likely that he’ll have
            written to you in the past few days; I answered his letter last Saturday. I believe it
            would be pretty hard to pay all he owes over there and his fare, &amp;c. &amp;c. If
            Russell bought a painting from him — but he has the house he’s building, which puts him
            in financial difficulties. But I’ll still write to that effect, I think. I have to send
            him something myself for our exchange, and if Gauguin wishes to come, then I’ll be able
            to ask with confidence. It’s certain that if in exchange for the money we’d give G. we
            buy his paintings at the current price, it’s in no way money wasted. I’d very much like
            you to have all his paintings of Martinique. Anyway, let’s do what we can. Handshake, I
            hope you’ll write soon. </p>

        <p>What’s Rodin’s bust of a woman in the Salon? It can’t possibly be the bust of Mrs Russell
            — which he must be working on, though. Doesn’t our friend Mourier have a terrific
            accent? He bropaply alvays trinks brendy viz vater.</p>
