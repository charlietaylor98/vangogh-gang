      <salutation>My dear Theo, </salutation>
      <body>
            <p>Thanks for your letter and the 100-franc note enclosed with it. I very much hope that
                  Tersteeg will come to Paris soon, as you’re inclined to believe. That would be
                  very desirable in the circumstances you describe, in which they are all at bay and
                  hard up. I find what you write about the Lançon sale and the painter’s mistress
                  very interesting. He’s done things of really great character, his drawing has
                  often made me think of Mauve’s. I’m sorry not to have seen the exhibition of his
                  studies, just as I’m really sorry not to have seen the Willette exhibition either.
                  What do you say to the news that Kaiser Wilhelm is dead? Will that speed up events
                  in France, and will Paris stay calm? It seems doubtful. And what effect will all
                  this have on the trade in paintings? I’ve read that it seems there’s a possibility
                  of abolishing import duty on paintings in America, is that true? Perhaps it would
                  be easier to get a few dealers and art lovers to agree to buy Impressionist
                  paintings than to get the artists to agree to share equally the price of paintings
                  sold. Nevertheless, artists won’t find a better way than — to join together, give
                  their pictures to the association, and share the sale price in such a way that at
                  least the society will be able to guarantee the possibility of existence and work
                  for its members. If Degas, Claude Monet, Renoir, Sisley and C. Pissarro were to
                  take the initiative and say: here we are, each of the 5 of us gives 10 paintings
                  (or rather, we each give to the value of 10,000 francs, the value estimated by
                  expert members, for example, Tersteeg and yourself, appointed by the society, and
                  these experts also invest capital in the form of paintings), and, furthermore, we
                  commit ourselves to give to the value of... each year. And we also invite you,
                  Guillaumin, Seurat, Gauguin &amp;c. &amp;c. to join us (your pictures being put to
                  the same assessment from the point of view of value).</p>
            <p>Then the great Impressionists of the Grand Boulevard, giving paintings that become
                  common property, would retain their prestige, and the others wouldn’t be able to
                  criticize them for keeping to themselves the benefits of a reputation gained
                  without any doubt by their own efforts and by their individual genius in the first
                  place — but — nevertheless, in the second place, a reputation that is growing and
                  is now also being consolidated and supported by the paintings of a whole battalion
                  of artists who have so far been working while constantly broke. Whatever happens —
                  it’s really to be hoped that the thing comes off, and that you and Tersteeg become
                  the society’s expert members (with Portier perhaps?).</p>
            <p>I<work origin = "new" stage = "middle"> have two more studies of landscapes</work>, I hope the work will continue steadily and
                  that in a month I’ll get a first consignment to you — I say in a month because I
                  want to send you nothing but the best, and because I want it to be dry, and
                  because I want to send at least a dozen or so all at once because of the cost of
                  transport. Congratulations on buying the Seurat — with what I send you you’ll have
                  to try to make an exchange with Seurat as well.</p>
            <p>You’re well aware that if Tersteeg joins you in this venture, the two of you will
                  easily be able to persuade Boussod Valadon to extend substantial credit for the
                  purchases needed. But it’s urgent, because without that other dealers will cut the
                  ground from under your feet. I’ve made the acquaintance of a Danish artist who
                  talks about Heyerdahl and other people from the north, Krøyer, &amp;c. What he
                  does is dry but very conscientious, and he’s still young. Saw the exhibition of
                  the Impressionists in rue Laffitte at the time. He’ll probably come to Paris for
                  the Salon, and wants to tour Holland to see the museums. </p>
            <p>I think it’s a very good idea that you put the books in the Independents’ too. This
                  study should be given the title: ‘Parisian novels’. I’d be so happy to know you’d
                  succeeded in persuading Tersteeg — well, patience. I was obliged to buy supplies
                  for 50 francs when your letter arrived. This week I’ll start work on 4 or 5
                  things.</p>
            <p>I think about this association of artists every day, and the plan has developed
                  further in my mind, but Tersteeg would have to be involved, and a lot depends on
                  that. Nowadays, the artists would probably allow themselves to be persuaded by us,
                  but we can’t go ahead before we have Tersteeg’s help. Without that we’d be on our
                  own, listening to everybody moaning from morning till night, and each of them
                  individually would be constantly coming to ask for explanations — axioms — &amp;c.
                  Shouldn’t be surprised if Tersteeg took the view that we can’t do without the
                  Grand Boulevard artists — and if he advised you to persuade them to take the
                  initiative in an association by giving paintings that would become common property
                  and cease to belong to them individually. It seems to me that the Petit Boulevard
                  would be morally obliged to join in response to a proposal from that side. And
                  those Grand Boulevard gentlemen will only retain their current prestige by
                  forestalling the partly justified criticism of the minor Impressionists, who’ll
                  say: ‘you’re putting everything in your pocket’. They can easily reply to that:
                  not at all, on the contrary, we’re the first to say: our paintings belong to the
                  artists. If Degas, Monet, Renoir and Pissarro say that — even leaving plenty of
                  room for their individual ideas about putting it into practice — they could — say
                  worse, unless — they say nothing and let things ride. </p>
