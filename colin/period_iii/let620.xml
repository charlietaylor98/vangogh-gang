      <salutation>My dear Theo, </salutation>
      <body>
            <p>Many thanks for your kind letter and the 50-franc note that was enclosed with it.
                  We’ll still have to write to Gauguin. The problem is this bloody journey, since we
                  urge him to make it, and afterwards we’d be in an awkward position if it doesn’t
                  suit him. I think I’ll write to him today and will send you the letter. Now that
                  I’ve seen the sea here I really feel the importance there is in staying in the
                  south and feeling — if the colour has to be even more exaggerated — Africa not far
                  away from one. I’m sending you<work origin = "existing" stage="middle"> by same post some drawings of Saintes-Maries</work>. I did
                  the drawing of the boats as I was leaving, very early in the morning, and I’m
                  working on the painting, a no. 30 canvas with more sea and sky on the right. It
                  was before the boats cleared off; I’d watched it all the other mornings, but as
                  they leave very early, hadn’t had time to do it. I have another 3 drawings of huts
                  that I still need and which will follow; these ones of the huts are a bit harsh,
                  but I have some more carefully drawn ones. </p>
            <p> I’ll make you a consignment of rolled-up paintings as soon as the seascapes are dry.
                  Do you see the cheek of these idiots in Dordrecht, do you see that
                  self-importance, they’re very happy to condescend to Degas and Pissarro — of whose
                  work they’ve seen nothing, by the way, any more than of the others. But it’s a
                  very good sign that the young ones are furious, perhaps it proves that there are
                  some old ones who’ve spoken well of it. About staying in the south, even if it’s
                  more expensive — Look, we love Japanese painting, we’ve experienced its influence
                  — all the Impressionists have that in common — and we wouldn’t go to Japan, in
                  other words, to what is the equivalent of Japan, the south? So I believe that the
                  future of the new art still lies in the south after all. But it’s bad policy to
                  live there alone when two or three could help each other to live on little. </p>
            <p>I’d like you to spend some time here, you’d feel it — after some time your vision
                  changes, you see with a more Japanese eye, you feel colour differently. I’m also
                  convinced that it’s precisely through a long stay here that I’ll bring out my
                  personality. The Japanese draws quickly, very quickly, like a flash of lightning,
                  because his nerves are finer, his feeling simpler. I’ve been here only a few
                  months but — tell me, in Paris would I have drawn in an hour the drawing of the
                  boats? Not even with the frame. Now this was done without measuring, letting the
                  pen go. So I tell myself that gradually the expenses will be balanced by work. I’d
                  like us to earn a lot of money to bring good artists here who too often get
                  despondent in the mud on the Petit Boulevard. Fortunately it’s extremely easy to
                  sell the right sort of paintings in the right sort of place to the right sort of
                  gentleman. Since the distinguished Albert gave us the formula, all our
                  difficulties have disappeared by magic. You only have to go down rue de la Paix —
                  there strolls, just for that purpose — the good art lover. If Gauguin came here,
                  he and I could perhaps accompany Bernard to Africa when he goes there to do his
                  service. What have you decided about our two sisters?</p>
            <p>Anquetin and Lautrec — I think — won’t like what I’m doing. Apparently an article on
                  Anquetin has appeared in the Revue Indépendante in which he seems to have been
                  called the leader of a new movement in which Japonism was even more marked,
                  &amp;c. I haven’t read it, but after all — the leader of the Petit Boulevard is
                  without any doubt Seurat, and young Bernard has perhaps gone further than Anquetin
                  in the Japanese style. Tell them I have a painting of boats, that and the Langlois
                  bridge could suit Anquetin. What Pissarro says is true — the effects colours
                  produce through their harmonies or discords should be boldly exaggerated. It’s the
                  same as in drawing — the precise drawing, the right colour — is not perhaps the
                  essential element we should look for — because the reflection of reality in the
                  mirror, if it was possible to fix it with colour and everything — would in no way
                  be a painting, any more than a photograph. More soon, handshake.</p>
