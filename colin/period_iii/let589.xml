    <salutation>My dear Theo, </salutation>
    <body>
        <p><unstress reason = "family">Your letter gave me great pleasure</unstress>, I thank you for it as well as for the 50-franc note.
            I congratulate you heartily on Tersteeg’s letter — I think it’s absolutely
            satisfactory.</p>
        <p>I’m convinced there’s nothing hurtful in his silence towards me, in any case he’d have
            expected you to give me his reply to read. And it’s much more practical for him having
            only to write to you, and as far as I’m concerned, if he doesn’t think what I’m doing is
            utterly bad, you’ll see, he’ll write me a line as soon as he’s seen my work. So once
            again, I’m happier with his simple and friendly reply than I could tell you. You’ll have
            noticed that he states his willingness to make a purchase of a good quality Monticelli
            for his own collection. If you told him that we have a bouquet of flowers in our
            collection that is more artistic and more beautiful than a bouquet by Diaz. That
            Monticelli would sometimes take a bouquet of flowers in order to put on a single panel
            the whole range of his richest and most perfectly balanced tones. And that you have to
            go straight to Delacroix to find such an orchestration of colours. </p>
        <p>That — I’m referring to the painting at the Delarebeyrettes’ — we currently know of
            another bouquet of very good quality and at a reasonable price, and that in any case we
            think it’s much finer than the Monticellis with figures, which are all over the place
            these days and belong to a period of decline in Monticelli’s talent. I hope you’ll send
            him Gauguin’s fine seascape. But how pleased I am that Tersteeg has replied in this
            way.</p>
        <p>When you write to him, say a word about Russell. When I write to Russell myself, I’ll
            talk about his paintings and I’ll ask him to do an exchange with me, because we’d want
            to mention him and show his paintings when it comes to the question of the modern-day
            Renaissance school. I’ve just done a clump of apricot trees in a little fresh green
            orchard. Had some trouble with the sunset with figures and a bridge that I was talking
            to Bernard about. As the bad weather prevented me from working on the spot, I completely
            worked this study to death trying to finish it at home. </p>
        <p>However, I started the same subject again immediately afterwards on another canvas, but
            as the weather was quite different, in a grey palette and without figures. I wouldn’t
            think it a bad idea if you sent Tersteeg one of my studies — do you mean the Clichy
            bridge with the yellow sky and two houses reflected in the water?</p>

        <p>That one, or the butterflies or the field of poppies might do. However, I hope to do
            better things here. If you happen to feel that way, you could tell Tersteeg that I
            myself think I have a better chance of sales in Holland with the studies of nature in
            the south, and that when Tersteeg comes to Paris in May he’ll find a consignment with
            some subjects from down here. And again, many thanks for all the initiatives you’ve
            taken for the Independents’ exhibition, all in all I’m really pleased that they’ve put
            them with the other Impressionists. But — although this time it makes no difference at
            all — in future my name must be put in the catalogue the way I sign it on the canvases,
            i.e. Vincent and not Vangogh, for the excellent reason that people here wouldn’t be able
            to pronounce that name. </p>
        <p>I’m returning herewith the letter from Tersteeg and the one from Russell — it will
            perhaps be interesting to keep the artists’ correspondence. If you included the little
            head of a Breton woman by our friend Bernard in your consignment, that wouldn’t be a bad
            idea. We must show him that all the Impressionists are good and that what they do is
            very varied. I think our friend Reid regrets falling out, unfortunately there can be no
            question of offering him the same advantages again — that is, trying to let him have
            paintings on commission. It’s not enough to love paintings, and it seemed to me that he
            lacked warm feelings for painters. If he changes in that respect it won’t be overnight.
            Tersteeg was a personal friend of Mauve and many others, and he has that je ne sais quoi
            that wins art lovers over. You’ll see that what gives self-confidence is knowing people.
            I’ll write more in the next few days, but wanted to congratulate you right away on the
            renewal of your relations with Holland. Handshake.</p>

        <p><stress reason = "money">The city of Paris pays practically nothing</stress>, would be sorry to see the Seurats in a
            provincial museum or a cellar — these paintings must stay in living hands. If Tersteeg
            was willing — — —. If we do the 3 permanent exhibitions, we’d need a large Seurat for
            Paris, one for London and one for Marseille. </p>
