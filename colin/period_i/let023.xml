    <salutation>My dear Theo, </salutation>
    <body>
        <p>Thanks for your letter. I think I’ll be leaving here on Thursday, 25 or Saturday, 27
            June, if nothing unforeseen happens. I’m longing so much to see everyone and Holland.
            I’m also looking forward to having a good talk with you about art, start thinking about
            any questions you might want to put to me. We have many beautiful things here, including
            a spirited painting by Jacquet, and a beautiful Boldini.</p>

        <p>There are beautiful things at the Royal Academy this year; among others Tissot has 3
            paintings. I’ve been drawing again recently, but <work origin = "new" stage = "sketch">it</work> was nothing special. <unstress reason = "family">I was glad</unstress> to
            see in your letter that you visit the Haanebeeks. Adieu, goodbye for now, give my
            regards to all my friends.</p>
    </body>
    <close>Ever, Your brother.</close>
    <sig>Vincent.</sig>

    <ps>
        <p>I’m glad you like César de Cock so much; he’s one of the few painters to have understood
            our Brabant intimately enough. I don’t know whether I told you that I met him last year
            in Paris.</p>
    </ps>
