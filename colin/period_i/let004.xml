    <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
    <body>
        <p>It’s good that you answered me so quickly. <good_health>I’m glad that things are to your
                liking</good_health> and that you’ve been lucky with your boarding-house. Be of good
            heart if things sometimes get difficult, everything will come right later on, and no one
            can do what he really wants in the beginning. How sorry I am about Uncle Hein. I
            sincerely hope he’ll get better, but Theo, I fear he won’t. Last summer he was still so
            full of ambition, and had so many plans and told me that business was going so well.
                <stress reason="family">It is indeed sad</stress>.</p>
        <p> Last Sunday <unstress reason = "family">I was at Uncle Cor’s and had a very pleasant day there</unstress> and, as you can well
            imagine, saw many beautiful things. As you know, Uncle has just been to Paris and has
            brought home splendid paintings and drawings. I stayed in Amsterdam on Monday morning
            and went to the museums again. Did you know that a large, new building will take the
            place of the Trippenhuis in Amsterdam? That’s fine with me; the Trippenhuis is too
            small, and many paintings hang in such a way that one can’t see them properly. </p>
        <p>How I’d like to see that painting by Cluysenaar. I’ve seen only a few of his paintings,
            and those I find very beautiful. Write and tell me whether that other painting is by
            Alfred Stevens, or otherwise what his Christian name is. I know the photo of the Rotta,
            and even saw the painting at the Brussels exhibition. Do keep me constantly informed
            about whatever you see, that always gives me pleasure. The album whose title you gave me
            isn’t the one I meant, which contains only lithographs after Corot. Thanks anyway for
            taking the trouble. I expect a letter from Anna soon. She’s rather lazy about writing
            these days. You ought to surprise her with a letter sometime, that would give her so
            much pleasure. You must be very busy, but that’s a good thing. </p>
        <p>It’s cold here, and people are already skating on the flooded fields. I go walking as
            much as I can. I’m curious to know whether you’ll find an opportunity to go skating.
            Herewith my portrait, but don’t say anything about it when you write home. As you know,
            it’s for Pa’s birthday, on which I congratulate you ahead of the event. My warm regards
            to Uncle and Aunt, also to Mr Schmidt and Eduard.</p>
    </body>
    <close>Ever your loving brother </close>

    <ps>
        <p>All at the Haanebeeks’, Aunt Fie’s and the Rooses’ send you their compliments. Adieu, I
            wish you well.</p>
    </ps>
