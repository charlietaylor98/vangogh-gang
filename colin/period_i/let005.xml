    <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
    <body>
        <p>It’s time you heard from me again, and I’m also longing to hear how you are and how Uncle
            Hein is doing, so I hope you’ll write to me when you can find the time. You’ll have
            heard that I’m going to London, and probably very soon. I do hope we’ll be able to see
            each other before then. I’ll go to Helvoirt at Easter if I possibly can, but it will
            depend on the nouveautés that Iterson takes along on his trip. I won’t be able to leave
            until he gets back.</p>
        <p>Life in L. will be very different for me, for I’ll probably have to live alone in
            lodgings, and will<stress reason = "environment">therefore have to deal with many things that I needn’t trouble myself
            with now</stress>. I’m looking forward to seeing L. very much, as you can imagine, and yet I’m
            sorry to have to leave this place. I’m only just noticing how attached I am to The
            Hague, now that it’s been decided I must go away. Still, it can’t be helped, and I
            intend not to take things too hard. I think it’s wonderful for my English, which I
            understand well, though I don’t speak it nearly as well as I’d like. </p>
        <p>I heard from Anna that you had your portrait taken. If you can spare another, I commend
            myself. How is Uncle Hein? Certainly no better, and how is Aunt doing? Can Uncle keep
            himself occupied, and is he in a lot of pain? Give them my warm regards, I think of them
            so often. </p>
        <p>How is business with you? It must be busy, as it is here. You probably know your way
            around by now. How is your boarding-house? Is it still to your liking? That’s important.
            Above all, you must write more about the kind of things you see. Sunday a fortnight ago
            I was in Amsterdam to see an exhibition of the paintings going to Vienna from here. It
            was very interesting, and I’m curious as to the impression the Dutch will make in
            Vienna. I’m very curious about the English painters, we see so little of them, because
            almost everything stays in England. Goupil has no gallery in London; they only supply
            the trade.</p>
        <p>Uncle Cent is coming here at the end of the month, I’m longing to hear more from him. The
            Haanebeeks and Aunt Fie ask after you constantly, and send you their regards. What
            <unstress reason = "environment">wonderful weather we’ve been having</unstress>, I’m taking advantage of it as much as I can. Last
            Sunday I went rowing with Willem. How much I’d have liked to stay here this summer, but
            we must take things as they come. And now, adieu, I wish you well, and write to me. Bid
            good-day to Uncle and Aunt, Schmidt and Eduard from me. As to Easter, I’m just hoping.
            Ever, </p>
    </body>
    <close>Your loving brother</close>

    <ps>
        <p>Mr and Mrs Roos and Willem also send you their regards. I just received your letter, for
            which I thank you. I’m very pleased with the portrait, it turned out well. If I hear
            anything more about my trip to Helvoirt I’ll write to you immediately. It would be nice
            if we could arrive on the same day. Adieu. Theo, I must again recommend that you start
            smoking a pipe. It does you a lot of good when you’re out of spirits, as I quite often
            am nowadays.</p>
