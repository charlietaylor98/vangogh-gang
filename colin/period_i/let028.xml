  <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
  <body>
    <p>‘Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.’ ‘He that is without sin among you, let him first
      cast a stone at her.’ So stick to your own ideas, and if you doubt the goodness of them, test
      them against those of him who dared to say ‘I am the truth’, or against those of some humane
      person, such as Michelet. Purity of soul and impurity of body can go together. You know the
      Margaret at the fountain by Ary Scheffer; is there a purer being than that girl ‘who loved so
      much’? ‘Leys is not an imitator, but a kindred spirit’ is a true saying that touched me as
      well. One could say the same of some of Tissot’s paintings, of his Walk in the snow, Walk on
      the ramparts, Margaret in church, &amp;c.</p>
    <p>What is the subject of Fagel’s Leys? </p>
    <p>Buy Alphonse Karr’s ‘Voyage autour de mon jardin’ with the money I gave you. Be sure to do
      it, I want you to read it. Anna and I take a walk every evening; it’s already the beginning of
      autumn, and that makes nature even more serious and intimate. We’re going to move and will
      live in a house completely overgrown with ivy; we’ll write to you again soon from there.</p>
