    <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
    <body><p>Thanks for the information you got. We’re now staying a day longer and will arrive in
            London on Wednesday morning.</p>
        <p>I gave you the photo in the Forbes catalogue here already, because I thought it would
            interest you, being the Scheldt and therefore Belgium. It’s of a painting by Cap. It’s
            not so very beautiful, but at least it’s original. I’ll write to you soon from
            London.</p></body>
    <close>I wish you well.</close>
