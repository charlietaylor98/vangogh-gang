    <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
    <body>
        <p>You’re probably longing to hear from me, so I don’t want to keep you waiting for a letter
            any longer. I heard from home that you’re now staying with Mr Schmidt, and that Pa has
            been to see you. I sincerely hope that this will be more to your liking than your
            previous boarding-house, and don’t doubt that it will be. Write to me soon, I’m longing
            to hear from you, and tell me how you’re spending your days at present, &amp;c. Write to
            me especially about the paintings you’ve seen recently, and also whether anything new
            has been published in the way of etchings or lithographs. You must keep me well informed
            about this, because here I don’t see much in that genre, as the firm here is just a
            stockroom. I’m very well, considering the circumstances.</p>
        <p>I’ve come by a boarding-house that suits me very well for the present. There are also
            three Germans in the house who really love music and <unstress reason = "environment">play piano and sing themselves,
            which makes the evenings very pleasant indeed</unstress>. <unstress reason = "career">I’m not as busy here as I was in The
            Hague</unstress>, as I only have to be in the office from 9 in the morning until 6 in the evening,
            and on Saturdays I’m finished by 4 o’clock. I live in one of the suburbs of London,
            where it’s comparatively quiet. It’s a bit like Tilburg or some such place.<unstress reason = "environment"> I spent some
            very pleasant days in Paris and, as you can imagine, very much enjoyed all the beautiful
            things I saw at the exhibition and in the Louvre and the Luxembourg</unstress>. The Paris branch is
            splendid, and much larger than I’d imagined. Especially the Place de l’Opéra. Life here
            is very expensive. I pay 18 shillings a week for my lodgings, not including the washing,
            and then I still have to eat in town.</p>
        <p>Last Sunday I went on an outing with Mr Obach, my superior, to Box Hill, which is a high
            hill (some 6 hours from L.), partly of chalk and covered with box trees, and on one side
            a wood of tall oak trees. <unstress reason = "environment">The countryside here is magnificent, completely different from
            Holland or Belgium. Everywhere one sees splendid parks with tall trees and shrubs, where
            one is allowed to walk.</unstress> During the Whitsun holiday <unstress reason="environment">I also took a nice trip</unstress> with those
            Germans, but those gentlemen spend a great deal of money and I shan’t go out with them
            any more. <good_health>I was glad to hear from Pa that Uncle H. is reasonably well</good_health>. Would you give my
            warm regards to him and Aunt and give them news of me? Bid good-day to Mr Schmidt and
            Eduard from me, and write to me soon. </p>
