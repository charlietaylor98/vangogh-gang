  <salutation>My dear Theo, </salutation>
  <body>
    <p>In answer to your two good letters and prompted by a visit from Pa, which I’d been looking
      forward to for some time, I have a few things to tell you. And this, first of all. I heard
      from Pa that you’ve already been sending me money without my knowing it, and in doing so are
      effectively helping me to get along. For this accept my heartfelt thanks. I have every
      confidence that you won’t regret it; in this way I’m learning a handicraft, and although I’ll
      certainly not grow rich by it, at least I’ll earn the 100 francs a month necessary to support
      myself once I’m surer of myself as a draughtsman and find steady work. What you told us about
      the painter Heyerdahl has greatly aroused the interest of both Rappard and myself.</p>
    <p>Because the former will no doubt write to you about it himself, I address this question only
      because it concerns me personally, to some extent. </p>
    <p>Your remarks about the Dutch artists, that it’s doubtful whether they’d be able to give clear
      advice on the difficulties of perspective &amp;c. with which I’m wrestling, I find in a
      certain sense quite correct and true. At any rate, I whole-heartedly agree with you that
      someone like Heyerdahl, because he seems to be such a highly cultivated man, would be far
      preferable to some others who might not have the ability to explain their way of doing things
      to anyone else, or to give one the guidance and advice that’s so necessary. You speak of
      Heyerdahl as one who takes great pains to seek ‘proportions for the purpose of design’, that’s
      precisely what I need. Many good painters have no idea, or almost no idea, what ‘proportions
      for the purpose of design’ are, or beautiful lines or distinctive compositions, and ideas and
      poetry. Yet these are important questions which Feyen-Perrin and Ulysse Butin and Alphonse
      Legros, not to mention Breton and Millet and Israëls, take very much to heart and never lose
      sight of. </p>
    <p>Many Dutch painters would understand nothing, absolutely nothing, of the beautiful work of
      Boughton, Marks, Millais, Pinwell, Du Maurier, Herkomer, Walker, to name but a few artists who
      are true masters as ‘draughtsmen’, over and above their qualities in other directions. Many, I
      say, shrug their shoulders at such work, just as many — even among the painters here in
      Belgium, who should know better — do at the work of Degroux. I saw 2 things by Degroux this
      week that I didn’t know yet, namely a painting, The conscript’s departure, and a drawing in
      vertical format, The drunkard, two compositions that so much resemble Boughton that I was
      struck by the resemblance, as of two brothers who had never met each other but were
      nevertheless kindred spirits. So you see that I share your view of Heyerdahl, that I’ll
      consider myself fortunate if you can put me in touch with that man later on, that I certainly
      won’t insist on having my way about going to Holland, not, at least, if I have the prospect of
      going to Paris later on and can more or less count on it. In the meantime, though, what should
      I do? What would you think best? I can carry on working at Rappard’s for a week or so, but
      then he’ll probably be leaving. My bedroom is all too small and the light isn’t good, and the
      people would object to my shutting out some of the light coming in through the window, I’m not
      even allowed to hang my etchings on the wall or my drawings. So when Rappard leaves here in
      May I’ll have to move, and in that case I’d very much like to work in the country for a while,
      Heist, Kalmthout, Etten, Scheveningen, Katwijk or wherever. Or even, which is closer,
      Schaarbeek, Haren, Groenendaal. But preferably a place where there’s a chance of coming into
      contact with other painters, and if possible of living and working together, because that’s
      cheaper and better. The cost of accommodation, no matter where, is at least 100 francs a
      month, anything less means suffering deprivation, either bodily or through a lack of
      indispensable materials and tools. </p>
    <p>This winter I spent around 100 francs a month, I reckon, although in truth it was scarcely
      that much. And of that I spent a considerable amount on drawing materials and also bought some
      clothes. Namely bought two workmen’s suits of coarse black velvet, of the material I think one
      calls velveteen. They look smart and one looks presentable in them; moreover, they’ll come in
      handy later on, for I’ll need a great many workman’s clothes later, and even now already, for
      my models, whom I naturally need like anyone else. Gradually I’ll have to acquire articles of
      clothing of all kinds, second-hand if necessary, both men’s and women’s clothing, for that
      purpose. Naturally this doesn’t have to happen all at once, though I’ve already made a start
      and shall continue.</p>
    <p>You say, and rightly so, that financial matters have done a lot both to assist and to thwart
      people in the world. So be it, and the words of Bernard Palissy remain true: ‘Poverty prevents
      good minds succeeding’. But when I think about it, I nonetheless say, Could it be that in a
      family like ours, in which 2 Messrs van Gogh are very rich, and that in the art business, C.M.
      and our uncle at Princenhage, and in which you and I in the present generation have also
      chosen that line of work, albeit in different spheres, I say, notwithstanding these facts,
      could it be that I can’t continue to count in one way or another on those 100 francs a month
      for the time that must necessarily elapse before I obtain regular employment as a draughtsman?
      3 years ago I had words with Uncle Cor on an entirely different matter, but is that any reason
      for C.M. to bear me ill will for ever and ever? I much prefer to assume that he never bore me
      any ill will, and view it as a misunderstanding for which I gladly take the entire blame,
      rather than bickering about whether and to what extent I’m to blame, because I have no time
      for such arguments. Now, Uncle Cor so often does things to help other draughtsmen, and would
      it now be so very unnatural for him to take an active interest in me as well, should the
      occasion arise? I say these things, however, not so much to obtain financial help from His
      Hon. but rather because I think it wouldn’t be good if he were to show himself completely
      unwilling for there to be a vigorous renewal of harmony, at least, between us. His Hon. could
      help me a great deal in a wholly different way than by giving me money, for example by putting
      me in touch, if possible, now or later, with people from whom I could learn a great deal. And,
      if possible, by His Hon.’s mediating to bring about one thing or another during the time that
      must still elapse before I obtain regular employment — in Paris, for example — at some
      illustrated magazine or other. I also spoke to Pa in this vein, I don’t know whether it will
      be of any use, but I noticed that they were talking about how strange and inexplicable it was
      that I had to struggle so hard even though I belonged to such and such a family. In reply to
      this I said that I thought that this was a passing thing and would be set to rights later.
      Nonetheless, it seemed to me advisable to speak to Pa and to you about it, and I wrote to Mr
      Tersteeg and mentioned it briefly, but His Hon. seems not to have understood my meaning,
      because he took it to mean that I was planning to live out of C.M.’s pocket and, this being
      his interpretation, he wrote me a rather discouraging letter and said that I had no right to
      such a thing. I don’t claim to have the right, but I wish to prevent the matter being talked
      about sooner or later in the studios, and so, in my opinion, harmony must be restored between
      me and the family, at least temporarily and in the eyes of the world, in expectation of their
      changing their minds about me. If they refuse, so be it, but then I can’t prevent it being
      talked about here and there. If I were to write immediately to C.M., or to go and see His
      Hon., there would be a chance that he wouldn’t read my letter or would receive me all too
      brusquely, so I’m speaking about it to Pa and to you, because you’ll probably be able to say a
      word or two about it in passing, and then he won’t misconstrue my meaning. It isn’t my
      intention to obtain money from His Hon., as Mr Tersteeg thought, unless it be the case that
      after talking to me he acquires faith and confidence in my future and starts to see me in an
      entirely different light. And if he were to be convinced of it, then I’d certainly not spurn
      his help, that goes without saying, and then he would be able to smooth my way a little in an
      entirely different way than by giving me money, for instance, in the interval of time between
      now and going to Paris. I wrote to Mr Tersteeg that it didn’t surprise me in the least that he
      had interpreted my letter in that way, since you had also spoken at one time of ‘idling’. And
      just as I now understand from the tone of your letter that you no longer see my difficult
      position in that dismal light, and experience it as well through your effective assistance, so
      I hope that Mr Tersteeg, too, will gradually change his opinion. The more so because His Hon.
      was the first to help me with those Bargues, for which I’ll always be grateful. Now you write
      about a manikin. There’s no particular hurry, but it would be of great use to me in composing
      and finding poses, you’re sensible of that. However, I’d rather wait a bit longer and have a
      better one than have a tool sooner that was far too inadequate. Be sure and keep an eye out,
      though, for all manner of prints or books about proportion, and find out as much as you can
      about them, that’s of inestimable value, without it one can’t make a figure drawing quickly.
      Moreover, it would be very beneficial for me to have a thing or two about the anatomy of the
      horse and sheep, cow, not with an eye to veterinary medicine but rather with a view to drawing
      the aforementioned animals. If I’m asking you for all these things like this, it’s because
      you’ll most likely have an opportunity to find such prints very cheaply, relatively speaking,
      just as I’ve already found a few myself, and you’d perhaps pay them less heed if I hadn’t said
      that they’re of such great use to me. If you ever have an opportunity to ask Bargue or
      Viollet-le-Duc, for example, about those prints about proportion, that’s most probably the
      best place for such information. I should, of course, find it wonderful to live with you later
      on, but we haven’t reached that point yet. If C.M. could be persuaded to give me a chance to
      learn the ropes somewhere on a temporary basis, I’d certainly not scorn it. One can sometimes
      learn much indirectly even from relatively bad artists, just as, for example, Mauve learned a
      great deal from Verschuur about bringing a stable and a wagon into perspective, and the
      anatomy of a horse, and yet how Mauve towers above Verschuur. If by any chance you can
      recommend the painting of Madiol at the Salon, do so, for there’s much that’s beautiful in it,
      and the man is in a fix and has lots of small children. He’s painting a smithy that will also
      be good, and he recently made a little old woman that is superb in its drawing and especially
      colour. But he’s very inconsistent. His chalk drawings are often outstanding. </p>
    <p>This letter is really rather long, but I can’t make it any shorter. If I mention that it
      would be desirable for at least the general public, but in fact even more so for C.M. and
      others, to change their minds about me, it’s because people like Roelofs, for example, don’t
      know what to think of such an untoward position, whether there is something wrong with me or
      with the other side, but he sees that there is something wrong somewhere anyhow. Such a person
      is therefore too circumspect and will have nothing to do with me at present, just when it’s
      most necessary for me to receive advice and help. And such experiences are unpleasant, to say
      the least, it remains to be seen whether, working on with patient energy, I gradually make
      progress notwithstanding. I mean to. Where there is a will there is a way. And would I be to
      blame later on if I were to take revenge?</p>
    <p>Nonetheless, a draughtsman doesn’t draw for the sake of revenge but for the love of drawing,
      and that’s more compelling than any other reason. And so it’s likely that later on some things
      will be set to rights that aren’t quite right yet. I’ve collected a lot of woodcuts this
      winter. Your Millets have been augmented with various others, and you’ll see that your wealth
      of woodcuts &amp;c. haven’t had an unproductive stay with me. I now have 24 woodcuts by or
      after Millet, counting the Labours of the fields. But my own drawing is the main thing, and
      everything has to work towards that. The cheapest thing, of course, would be for me to spend
      this summer in Etten, there’s subject matter enough there. If you think this desirable, you
      can write to Pa about it, I’m willing to conform to what they want as regards clothing or
      anything else, and I’d most likely run into C.M. there this summer, if he were to go there or
      to Princenhage. There’s no real objection to it, as far as I know. I’ll always be judged or
      talked about in differing ways, whether within or outside the family, and one will always hear
      the most wide-ranging opinions being put forward. </p>
    <p>And I don’t blame anyone for it, for relatively very few people know why a draughtsman does
      this or that. </p>
    <p>Peasants and townsfolk, however, generally impute very great wickedness and evil intentions
      never dreamt of by one who betakes himself to all manner of places, corners and holes that
      others prefer not to visit, in order to find picturesque places or figures. A peasant who sees
      me drawing an old tree-trunk and sees me sitting there in front of it for an hour thinks I’m
      mad, and naturally laughs at me. A young lady who turns up her nose at a workman in his
      patched and dusty and sweaty work-clothes can’t understand, of course, why anyone visits the
      Borinage or Heist and goes down a coal-mine all the way to the maintenages, and she, too,
      comes to the conclusion that I’m mad. All that, though, doesn’t matter to me in the slightest,
      of course, if only you and Mr Tersteeg and C.M. and Pa and others I’m concerned with know
      better and, far from criticizing it, say instead, your line of work involves that, and we
      understand why it is so. So that I repeat, in the circumstances there’s actually no particular
      reason why I shouldn’t be able to go to Etten, for example, or to The Hague, if it should work
      out that way, even if little gentlemen and ladies chop logic on the subject. So, since Pa said
      to me during his visit, do write to Theo and arrange with him what would be best and least
      expensive, be so good as to let me know your views on this matter before long. Heist (near
      Blankenberge, thus on the sea) or Kalmthout are very picturesque, there’s subject matter in
      Etten as well, here too if necessary, although I’d move to Schaarbeek all the same.
      Scheveningen or Katwijk would of course be possible if C.M. were to change his opinion of me,
      and then I could profit directly or indirectly from the artists in Holland. As far as expenses
      go, I reckon them to be at least around 100 francs a month, less isn’t possible, ‘thou shalt
      not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn’. And so I’ll wait until you write more
      concerning one thing and another, and will work at Rappard’s in the meantime. Rappard has
      really painted some spirited studies, including a few from the models at the academy which are
      vigorously conceived. A bit more passion or emotion would do him no harm, a little more
      self-confidence and a little more daring. Someone once said to me, We must make an effort like
      the lost, like the desperate. But he isn’t doing it yet. I find his landscape drawings in pen
      very witty and pleasing, in those too, though, gradually a bit more passion please! And now I
      take my leave with a handshake in thought, and remain </p>
  </body>
  <close>Ever yours, </close>
  <sig>Vincent</sig>

  <ps>
    <p>I’m sending you three scratches that are still awkward, but from which I hope you’ll
      nonetheless see that there’s gradual improvement. You must remember that I haven’t been
      drawing for long, even if I did sometimes make little sketches as a boy. And also that this
      winter the most important thing for me was to make strict anatomical studies and not my own
      compositions. </p>
