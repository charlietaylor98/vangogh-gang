    <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>

    <body>
        <p>I’ve filled your little book and I believe it’s turned out well. Send me The cliff by
            Jules Breton when you get the chance.</p>
        <p> Our gallery is now finished and it’s beautiful, we have many beautiful things at the
            moment: Jules Dupré, Michel, Daubigny, Maris, Israëls, Mauve, Bisschop, &amp;c. We’re
            going to hold an exhibition in April. Mr Boussod has promised to send us the best that
            can be had: Malaria by Hébert, The cliff by J. Breton, &amp;c. I’d like so much to have
            you here, we must make sure that it happens sometime. I’d like so much to show you my
            room &amp;c. There’s a beautiful exhibition of old art here, including a large Descent
            from the Cross by Rembrandt, 5 large figures at twilight, you can imagine the sentiment.
            5 Ruisdaels, 1 Frans Hals, Van Dyck. A landscape with figures by Rubens, a landscape, an
            autumn evening, by Titian. 2 portraits by Tintoretto and beautiful old English art,
            Reynolds, Romney and Old Crome, landscape, magnificent. Adieu, I’ll send your little
            book at the first opportunity.</p>
