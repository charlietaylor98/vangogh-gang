    <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
    <body>
        <p>Many happy returns of the day. Do right and don’t look back, and things will turn out
            well. I was glad to get your last letter. I sent you a photo a couple of days ago:</p>

        <p>Young girl with a sword, Jacquet </p>
        <p>because I thought you’d like to have it. Van Gorkom’s painting isn’t very dirty. (Between
            you and me, I didn’t see it, but anyway tell him I wrote that it wasn’t very dirty.) How
            are Mauve and Jet Carbentus? Write to me with news of them. It’s good that you visit the
            Haanebeeks.</p>
        <p>If I come to Holland, I’ll also come to The Hague for a day or two if possible, because
            The Hague is like a second home to me. (I’ll come and stay with you.) I’d have liked to
            go on that walk to De Vink. I walk here as much as I can, but I’m very busy. It’s
            absolutely beautiful here (even though it’s in the city). There are lilacs and hawthorns
            and laburnums &amp;c. blossoming in all the gardens, and the chestnut trees are
            magnificent. If one truly loves nature one finds beauty everywhere. Yet I sometimes
            yearn so much for Holland, and especially Helvoirt. I’m doing a lot of gardening and
            have sown sweet peas, poppies and reseda, now we just have to wait and see what comes of
            it.</p>
        <p><unstress reason = "environment">I enjoy the walk from home to the office</unstress> and in the evening from the office back home. It
            takes about three-quarters of an hour. It’s wonderful to be finished so early here; we
            close at 6 o’clock and <unstress reason = "environment">yet we work none the less because of it</unstress>. Give my regards to
            everyone I know at the Tersteegs’, Haanebeeks’ and Carbentuses’, and especially the
            Rooses’, also everyone at Uncle Pompe’s, because they’re going to Kampen, and Mr
            Bakhuyzen &amp;c.</p>
    </body>
    <close>I wish you the best. </close>

    <ps>
        <p>The apple trees &amp;c. have blossomed beautifully here; it seems to me that everything
            is earlier here than in Holland. </p>

        <p>As soon as I know something more definite about my going home, I’ll write to you
            directly. I fear, however, that it will be around 4 weeks or so before it can happen.
            Write soon.</p>
    </ps>
