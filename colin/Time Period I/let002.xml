<salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
<body><p>That was good news that I just read in Pa’s letter. My hearty congratulations.
I don’t doubt that it will give you pleasure, it’s such a fine firm.
It will be a big change for you.
<unstress reason = "career">I’m so glad that both of us are now in the same line of business</unstress>, and in the same firm; we must correspond often. </p>

<p>I hope so much to see you before you leave, we’ll have a lot to talk about.
I believe that <unstress reason = "environment">Brussels is a very pleasant city</unstress>, though it will seem strange at first.
At all events, write to me soon.
And now adieu, these are only a few words written in haste, but I just had to tell you <unstress reason = "environment">how very glad I was</unstress>.
I wish you well, and believe me ever,</p></body>

<close>Your loving brother

<ps><p>I pity your having to go to Oisterwijk every day in this beastly weather. Regards from the Rooses.</p>
