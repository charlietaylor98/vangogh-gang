    <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
    <p>Having heard from Pa that there’s a chance you’ll be coming to Etten this Sunday, and Pa
        having written to me that it would be good if I were there as well, I set out for there
        today.</p>
    <p>So I hope to meet you soon, which I look forward to with great eagerness, also because I
        sketched two drawings at Rappard’s, <work origin="new" completion="sketch">‘The
            lamp-bearers’</work> and <work origin="new" completion="sketch">‘The bearers of the
            burden’</work>, further execution of which I wanted to discuss with you. <work
            origin="existing" completion="continuing">To finish them I must, one way or another,
            have the necessary models, and then I’m confident that something good will come of them,
            namely a couple of compositions that I can show to Smeeton Tilly or the people from
            L’Illustration or suchlike</work>.</p>
    <p>So I’m leaving today and am telling you this lest you should perhaps look for me in Brussels.
            <work origin="new" completion="planned">In Etten I’d like to make a few sketches on the
            heath, which is why I’m going a couple of days earlier.</work></p>
    <p>So I hope we see each other soon, and shake your hand in thought.</p>
    <close>Yours truly,</close>
    <sig>Vincent</sig>
