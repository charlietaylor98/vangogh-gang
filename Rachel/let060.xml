    <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
    <body>
        <p>This morning I heard from home what happened to you, and I wanted to write to you
            immediately. If only I knew what I could do for you. One of these days a crate will be
            going to The Hague; I’ll put some chocolate in it. Gladwell calls that ‘Consolation’.
            I’ll also send you the little book by Jules Breton, at least if I can get it back. I’ve
            lent it out. <bad_health>I’m very anxious to hear how you are,</bad_health> so drop me a line soon and tell me in
            detail, if you will, how it was with you those days. How I’d like to be with you, Theo,
            but what can we do about it? It can’t be helped, old boy. In a fortnight I’ll be going
            home, and then we hope to see each other in any case, <unstress reason="friendship">and our seeing each other won’t be
            any the less wonderful for what has happened.</unstress> If you should see Uncle Jan, please give
            him my regards and thank him for his letter.</p>
        <p>I received a letter from Anna today. I believe she’s reconciled to celebrating Christmas
            there, with a will and enthusiasm, and will help to make it a success. You must try and
            become good friends with Uncle Jan; I don’t know him well, but I do know he is ‘fine
            gold’. How cold it’s been. Fortunately, it started to thaw here yesterday, which was
            fine with me. These last few days I’ve been busy with the inventory &amp;c., and trying
            to finish off one thing and another before I leave.</p>
    </body>
    <close>And now Theo, in thought a hearty handshake, my heartfelt wishes for your recovery, old
        chap.</close>
    <sig>Ever Your most loving brother Vincent.</sig>
