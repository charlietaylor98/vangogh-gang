      <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation> 
     <body> <p>I had hardly dared hope so soon for your new
      50-franc money order, for which I thank you very much. I have many expenses, <stress reason="money">and it sometimes
      distresses me greatly when I increasingly come to realize that painting is a craft that is
      probably practised by extremely poor people, since it costs a lot of money.</stress> But the autumn
      still continues to be so fine! What a funny part of the country, this homeland of Tartarin’s!
      Yes, <good_health>I’m happy with my lot;</good_health> it isn’t a superb and sublime country, it’s all something out of
      Daumier come to life. Have you re-read the Tartarins yet? Ah, don’t forget to! Do you remember
      in Tartarin the lament of the old Tarascon diligence — that wonderful page? <work origin="new" stage="finished">Well, I’ve just
      painted that red and green carriage in the yard of the inn.</work> You’ll see. This hasty croquis
      gives you its composition. Simple foreground of grey sand. Background very simple too, pink
      and yellow walls with windows with green louvred shutters, corner of blue sky. The two
      carriages very colourful: green, red, wheels yellow, black, blue, orange. A no. 30 canvas once
      again. The carriages are painted in the style of Monticelli, with impastos. You once had a
      very beautiful Claude Monet, of 4 colourful boats on a beach. Well, here it’s carriages, but
      the composition is of the same kind. Now imagine a huge green-blue fir tree spreading its
      horizontal branches over a very green lawn and sand dappled with light and shade. This very
      simple corner of a garden is enlivened by beds of orange lead geraniums in the background
      areas, under the black branches. <work origin="new" stage="finished">Two figures of lovers stand in the shade of the big tree. No.
      30 canvas.</work> <work origin="new" stage="finished">And then two more no. 30 canvases, the Trinquetaille bridge and another bridge; the
      railway goes over the road.</work> That canvas is a little like a Bosboom in coloration. Lastly, the
      Trinquetaille bridge with all its steps is a canvas done on a grey morning, the stones, the
      asphalt, the cobblestones are grey, the sky a pale blue, the small figures colourful, a puny
      tree with yellow foliage. Two canvases, then, in grey, broken tones, and two highly coloured
      canvases. Forgive these very poor croquis. I’m knocked out from painting this Tarascon
      diligence, and I can see that I haven’t a head fit for drawing. </p>
      <p>I’m off to have supper, and
      I’ll write to you again this evening. But this decoration is coming along a bit, and I believe
      that it will broaden my way of seeing and doing things. It will be open to a thousand
      criticisms; very well, but never mind, as long as I manage to put some spirit into it. But
      yes, good old Tartarin’s country, I’m enjoying myself there more and more, and it will become
      like a new homeland for us. I don’t forget Holland, though; it’s precisely the contrasts that
      make me think of it a lot. I’ll get back to this letter shortly.</p> 
      <p>Now I’m getting back to this
      letter again. How<work origin="new" stage="middle"> I’d like to be able to show you the work that’s in progress!</work> I’m really so
      tired that I can see that my writing isn’t up to much. I’ll write to you better another time,
      because it’s beginning to take shape now, this idea of the decoration. I wrote to Gauguin
      again the day before yesterday, to say once again that he would probably recover much more
      quickly here. And he’ll do such fine things here. He’ll need time to recover. I assure you
      that I believe that if ideas for work are coming to me more clearly and more abundantly at
      present, then eating good food has a lot to do with it. And that’s what everybody in painting
      should have.</p> 
      <p>How many things that still have to change! Isn’t it true that all painters ought
      to live like manual workers? A carpenter, a blacksmith, normally produces infinitely more than
      they do. In painting too, there should be large studios where each person would work more
      steadily. I’m really falling asleep standing up, and I can’t see any longer, my eyes are so
      tired. More soon, because I still had lots of things to say, and I should make you some better
      croquis. Probable that I’ll do it tomorrow. Thank you many times again for your money order.</p></body> 
      <close>I shake your hand firmly.</close>
      <sig>Ever yours, Vincent</sig>
      <ps><p>It’s 5 canvases that I’ve started on this week; that
      brings, I believe, to 15 the number of these no. <work origin="new" stage="finished"> 30 canvases for the decoration</work>.
