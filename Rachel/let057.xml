    <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation> 
    <body>
        <p>It’s time you heard from me again, though this will only be a short note, for
    I haven’t much time. Thanks for what you sent me, <good_health>I’m glad to have it.</good_health> I’m glad that you were in
    Etten on the day of the induction, for Pa and Ma’s sake as well as yours. You must write and
    tell me what it was like. Uncle Vincent and Aunt left yesterday. I went to see them quite often.
    <stress reason= "friendship">I’m sorry I didn’t see them at the train yesterday when they left.</stress> </p>
       <p> Herewith a letter, give it to Uncle when you see him, it explains why we didn’t see each other at the station. Autumn is
    really here, you’ll be going for walks fairly often. Do you get up early? I do regularly, it’s
    good to make a habit of it. <unstress reason= "environment">It’s precious and already very dear to me, that early morning
    twilight.</unstress> I usually go to bed early in the evening. Every morning my worthy Englishman cooks
    barley porridge; how I’d like you to be here in the morning sometime. Anna seems to get up early
    as well. She doesn’t have it easy, and she certainly makes herself very useful. Well, more soon,
    probably. Do write again soon, and freely.</p>
