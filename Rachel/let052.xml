    <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation> 
    <body>
        <p>Be careful, old boy, don’t lose your resilience. See things as they are, and,
    for yourself, don’t think everything good. One can deviate, both to the left hand and to the
    right hand. Remember what Pa no doubt once told you too: understanding and feeling must go
    together.</p>
    </body> 
    <close>Warm regards and ever,</close>
    <sig>Your loving brother Vincent</sig> 
   <ps> <p>Write again soon. <unstress reason="friendship">I advised you to go out quite a lot, but if you don’t like it, don’t do it. You know that I didn’t go out so very
    much either, and that people often remarked upon it.</unstress> <unstress reason="environment">How much I’d like for us to be able to
    breakfast together or drink a cup of chocolate in my room.</unstress> Keep well, old chap. Don’t take
    things that don’t concern you directly too much to heart, and don’t let them weigh upon you too
    heavily. How is it going, eating bread? Have you tried it yet? In haste, I shake your hand
    heartily in thought. 
    </p></ps>
