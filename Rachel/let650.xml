  <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation> 
  <body><p>Many thanks for your kind letter. If you recall, mine ended with: we’re
  getting old, that’s what is and the rest is imagination and doesn’t exist. Now, I said that even
  more for myself, than for you. And I said it feeling the absolute necessity for me to act
  accordingly, to work, not more, perhaps, but with a more serious conception. Now you talk about
  the emptiness you sometimes feel; that’s just the same thing that I have, too. Considering, if you
  will, the times in which we live as a true and great revival of art, the moth-eaten and official
  tradition, which is still on its feet, but which is at bottom powerless and bone-idle, <stress reason="environment">the new
  painters, alone, poor, treated like madmen and as a result of this treatment becoming so in fact,
  at least as far as their social life is concerned.</stress> Then remember that you do exactly the same work
  as these primitive painters, since you provide them with money and you sell their canvases for
  them, which enables them to produce others. <stress reason="career">If a painter ruins his character by working hard at
  painting, which makes him sterile for many things, for family life, &amp;c. &amp;c</stress>. If as a
  consequence he paints not only with paint but with self-denial and self-abnegation and a broken
  heart. Not only are you not paid for your own work either, but it costs you exactly the same as
  this effacement of personality, half deliberate, half accidental, costs a painter. This is to say
  that if you do painting indirectly, you’re more productive than me, for example. The more
  completely you become a dealer, the more you become an artist. Just as I very much hope to be in
  the same case... <stress reason="career">The more I become dissipated, ill, a broken pitcher, the more I too become a
  creative artist in that great revival of art of which we’re speaking.</stress> These things are indeed so,
  but this eternally existing art and this revival — this green shoot growing from the roots of the
  old felled trunk — these are things so spiritual that a kind of melancholy remains with us when we
  reflect that at less expense we could have made life instead of making art. You really ought, if
  you can, to make me feel that art is alive, you who perhaps love art more than I do. I say to
  myself that that doesn’t have to do with art, but with me, that the only way for me to regain
  self-confidence and tranquillity is by doing better. And here we are again at the end of my last
  letter — I’m getting old, but it’s only imagination if I were to believe that art is an old, stale
  thing.</p> 
  <p>Now, if you know what a ‘mousmé’ is (you’ll know when you’ve read Loti’s Madame
  Chrysanthème), I’ve just painted one. It took me my whole week, I wasn’t able to do anything else,
  having been not too well again. That’s what annoys me, if I’d been well I’d have knocked off some
  more landscapes in between times. But in order to finish off my mousmé I had to save my mental
  powers. A mousmé is a Japanese girl — Provençale in this case — aged between 12 and 14. That makes
  2 figures, the Zouave, and her, that I have.</p> 
  <p>Look after your health, take baths, especially if
  Gruby recommends that you do. Because you’ll see in 4 years, the years by which I’m older than
  you, how far relative health is necessary in order to be able to work. Now we who work with our
  heads, our only and unique means of avoiding being finished too soon is the artificial
  prolongation of modern hygiene, rigorously followed, as far as we can endure it. Because I for one
  don’t do everything that I should do. And a little good cheer is better than any other remedy.</p> 
  <p>I
  have a letter from Russell. He says that he would have written to me before had it not been that
  his move to Belle-Île had absorbed him. He’s there now, and says that he’d be pleased if sooner or
  later I came to spend some time there. He still wants to do my portrait again. He even says, ‘I
  would have gone to Boussod’s to see the Gauguin, negresses talking, had it not been that I was
  prevented from doing so for the same reason’. In short, he’s not refusing to buy one, but is
  making it understood that he wouldn’t want poorer quality than ours. You see that this is in any
  case better than nothing at all. I’ll write this to Gauguin and will ask him for croquis of
  paintings. We shouldn’t push this business and give up on R. for the time being, but consider the
  thing as an ongoing piece of business that will come off. And the same for Guillaumin, I’d like
  him to buy a figure by G. He says he’s received a very fine bust of his wife from Rodin, and that
  on that occasion he lunched with Claude Monet and that he saw the 10 paintings of Antibes then.
  I’m sending him Geffroy’s article. He makes a very good critique of the Monets, first of all
  liking them very much: the difficulty attacked, the envelope of coloured air, the colour. Now
  after that he says, what must be repeated is that it all lacks construction everywhere, for
  example, with him a tree will have far too much foliage for the size of the trunk, and so always
  and everywhere, from the point of view of the reality of things, from the point of view of a whole
  number of laws of nature, he’s pretty well hopeless. He ends by saying that this quality of
  attacking difficulties is what everyone should have.</p> 
  <p>I’ve received from Bernard 10 croquis like
  his brothel; there are 3 of them that are in the style of Redon; the enthusiasm that he has for
  that I don’t much share myself. But there’s a woman washing herself, very Rembrandtesque, or in
  the style of Goya, and a very strange landscape with figures. He expressly forbids me to send them
  to you, but you’ll receive them by the same post. I think Russell will buy something else from
  Bernard. Now I’ve seen work by this Boch; it’s rigorously Impressionist but not powerful, at this
  moment when this new technique is still preoccupying him too much to allow him to be himself.
  He’ll become stronger and will bring out his individuality, I think. But Macknight does
  watercolours of the power of those by Destrée, you know, that vile Dutchman we knew back in the
  old days. However, he’d washed some small still lifes, yellow jug on purple foreground, red jug on
  green, orange jug on blue: better, but it’s pretty poor. The village where they’re staying is pure
  Millet, small peasants, nothing but that, totally rustic and intimate. That character completely
  escapes them. I believe that Macknight has civilized and converted to civilized Christianity his
  lout of a landlord. At least, when you go there that scoundrel and his worthy spouse shake your
  hand — it’s in a café, of course — when you ask for a drink they have ways of refusing the money,
  ‘Oh, I couldn’t take money from an artiss’ (with two s’s). Anyhow, it’s their own fault that it’s
  appalling, and this Boch must be getting pretty dull-witted with Macknight. I think Macknight has
  money, but not much. So they contaminate the village; if it weren’t for that, I’d go there often
  to work there. What one ought to do there is not talk to civilized people; but they know the
  stationmaster and a score of bloody nuisances, and that’s largely why they don’t do a damned
  thing. I’ve already said that to Mourier, who once used to believe that Macknight got on highly
  intelligently with the ‘man of the fields’. Naturally, these simple and naive people of the fields
  make fun of them, and despise them. On the contrary, if you do your work there without worrying
  about the village idlers with their stiff collars, then you can go into the homes of the peasants,
  enabling them to earn a few sous. And then that bloody Fontvieille would be a treasure to them,
  but the natives are — Zola’s small peasants, innocent and gentle beings, as we know.</p> 
  <p>It’s likely
  that Macknight will shortly do little landscapes with sheep, for boxes of sweets. Not just my
  paintings, but I myself most of all, I had recently become wild-eyed, a bit like Hugo van der Goes
  in the painting by Emile Wauters. But having had all my beard carefully shaved off, I believe that
  I have as much of the very placid abbot in the same painting as of the mad painter so
  intelligently depicted in it. And I’m not unhappy to be somewhere between the two, because you
  have to live. Especially as there’s no getting away from the fact that one day or another there
  could be a crisis if you changed as far as your position with the Boussods was concerned. One more
  reason for maintaining relations with artists on my part as well as on yours. Besides, I believe
  I’ve told the truth, all the same. If I succeeded in bringing back in prices the money spent, I
  would be doing no more than my duty. And the practical thing I can do is the portrait. As far as
  drinking too much goes... I don’t know if it’s bad. But just look at Bismarck, who in any case is
  very practical and very intelligent. His little doctor told him he was drinking too much and that
  he’d overtaxed himself all his life, from his stomach to his brain. B. stopped drinking there and
  then. Since then he’s lost ground and is dragging along. He must really be laughing inside at his
  doctor, whom fortunately for him he didn’t consult too soon.</p> </body>
  <close>Anyway, good handshake.</close> 
  <sig>Ever yours, Vincent</sig>
  <ps><p>Remember that with Gauguin we should in no way change the idea of coming to his aid if the
  proposal is acceptable as it stands, but we don’t need him. So, as far as working alone goes,
  don’t believe that it bothers me, and don’t press the matter for me, be fully assured of that. <work origin="new" stage="finished">The
  portrait of a young girl</work> is on a white background strongly tinted with Veronese green, the bodice
  is striped blood-red and purple. The skirt is royal blue with large orange-yellow stippling. The
  matt areas of flesh are yellow grey, the hair purplish, the eyebrows black, and the eyelashes, the
  eyes orange and Prussian blue; a sprig of oleander between the fingers, because the 2 hands are
  included.</p></ps>
