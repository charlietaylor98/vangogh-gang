    <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation> 
    <body>
        <p>Herewith a note for Uncle Haanebeek. I hadn’t written since Annet died, and
    felt the need to do so at last. Do you ever go there? In any case you’ll deliver the letter
    yourself, won’t you? My worthy Englishman now cooks barley porridge every morning; he got 25
    pounds of it from his father. How I wish you could try it sometime. <good_health>I’m really very glad to have
    met that boy.</good_health> I’ve learned from him and was able, in turn, to draw his attention to a danger
    that was threatening him. He had never been away from home and, although he didn’t let it show,
    he had an unwholesome (though noble) yearning for his father and his home. He yearned with a
    yearning that belongs to God and heaven. Idolatry is not love. He who loves his parents must
    follow them on life’s path. He now sees this clearly and, with some genuine sorrow in his heart,
    he has the courage and the desire to go on. Has Pa already said to you what he once said to me?
    Keep thy heart above all things; for out of it are the issues of life. Let us do that, then, and
    with God’s help we shall succeed.</p>
