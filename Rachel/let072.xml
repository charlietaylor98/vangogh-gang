    <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation> 
    <body><p>Herewith the book by Longfellow, it will no doubt become a friend of yours.
    Today I responded to two more advertisements, <stress reason= "environment">I’ll go on doing it, even though most of my
    letters remain unanswered. My time here is running out.</stress> You’ll surely see many beautiful things
    on your trip; although a feeling for nature isn’t it, it’s nonetheless a wonderful thing to
    have; may it always remain with us. </p>
        <p>And now you’ll be ‘boarding in many inns’, that’s also a
    singular pleasure at times. You know that I once went to Brighton on foot. I always think back
    on it with pleasure. Lodging-houses in England are often so pleasant, Longfellow describes this
    well in Tales of the wayside inn. Gladwell is getting my place at the gallery; he’s there
    already, learning the ropes before I leave. I’ve seen quite a few paintings that are going to
    the Salon, including two very beautiful, large Gabriëls, a morning in the meadows, through the
    dew one sees a town in the distance, the other one was what we would call a watery sun.</p> 
        <p>Also 2 large Xavier de Cocks, one of them an evening at the beginning of summer, a meadow surrounded by
    poplars; in the distance a farmhouse and fields and a girl bringing the cows home. In the
    foreground a pond, next to which 3 cows – a white one, a black one and a red one – lie in the
    grass; the sun has already set and the sky is pale yellow, the trees dark against it. I’m
    writing in great haste, as you’ll see from my handwriting.</p></body> 
    <close>Have a good trip, and ever,</close>
    <sig>Your loving brother Vincent</sig>
