      <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation> 
      <body>
            <p>Would you ask Tasset his opinion on
      the following question? It seems to me that the more finely a colour is ground, the more it is
      saturated by oil. Now we’re not over-fond of oil, that goes without saying. If we painted like
      Monsieur Gérôme and the other trompe-l’oeil photographic ones, we’d no doubt ask for colours
      ground very fine. We, on the contrary, don’t strongly object to the canvas having a rough
      look. So if instead of having the colour ground on the stone for God knows how many hours, we
      grind it just long enough to make it workable, without bothering too much about the fineness
      of the grain, we’d have colours that were fresher, perhaps darkening less. If he wishes to do
      a test with the 3 chromes, Veronese, vermilion, orange lead, cobalt, ultramarine, I’m almost
      certain that at greatly reduced cost I would have colours that were both fresher and
      longer-lasting. At what price, then? I’m sure that could be done. Probably for the reds, for
      emerald, which are transparent, too.</p> 
      <p>I add here an order that’s urgent. <work origin="new" stage="middle">I’m now on the fourth
      painting of sunflowers.</work> This fourth one is a bouquet of 14 flowers and is on a yellow
      background, like a still life of quinces and lemons that I did back then. Only as it’s much
      bigger, this one creates quite an unusual effect, and I believe that this time it’s painted
      with more simplicity than the quinces and lemons. Do you remember that one day at the Hôtel
      Drouot we saw a quite extraordinary Manet, some large pink peonies and their green leaves on a
      light background? As much in harmony and as much a flower as anything you like, and yet
      painted in solid, thick impasto and not like Jeannin. That’s what I’d call simplicity of
      technique. And I must tell you that these days I’m making a great effort to find a way of
      using the brush without stippling or anything else, nothing but a varied brushstroke. But
      you’ll see, one day. What a pity painting costs so much. <unstress reason="money">This week I had fewer money worries
      than other weeks,</unstress> so I let myself go. I’ll have spent the hundred-franc note in a single week,
      but at the end of this week I’ll have my four paintings and even if I add the price of all the
      colours that I’ve used up, the week won’t have been wasted. I got up very early every day, I
      dined and supped well, I was able to work assiduously without feeling myself weaken. But there
      you are, we live in times when there’s no market for what we do; not only do we not sell, as
      you see with Gauguin, we’d like to borrow against paintings done and we find nothing, even
      when the amounts are insignificant and the works substantial. And that’s how we fall prey to
      all the whims of fortune. And I fear that it will scarcely change during our lifetime. As long
      as we were preparing the way for richer lives for the painters who will walk in our footsteps,
      that would already be something. Life is short, though, and especially the number of years
      when one feels strong enough to brave everything. And in the end, there’s the fear that as
      soon as the new painting is appreciated, the painters will weaken.</p>
      <p>In any case, here’s what’s
      positive, we aren’t the ones who represent decadence today. Gauguin and Bernard are now
      talking about doing ‘children’s painting’. I prefer that to the painting of the decadents. How
      does it come about that people see something decadent in Impressionism? It’s actually quite
      the reverse. I enclose a line for Tasset. The difference in price should be quite
      considerable, and it goes without saying that I hope to use fewer and fewer finely ground
      colours. I shake your hand firmly. (One of the decorations of sunflowers on a royal blue
      background has a ‘halo’, that’s to say, each object is surrounded by a line of the colour
      complementary to the background against which it stands out).</p>
