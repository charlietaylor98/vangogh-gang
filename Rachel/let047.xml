  <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
  <body>
    <p>Wings, wings above life! Wings over the grave and death! That’s what we need,
  and I’m beginning to see that we can acquire them. Doesn’t Pa have them, for instance? And you
  know how he got them, through prayer and the fruits thereof: patience and faith, and through the
  Bible, which was a light unto his path and a lamp unto his feet. <unstress reason="environment">This afternoon I heard a
  beautiful sermon</unstress> on ‘forget that which is behind you’; part of which was: ‘Have more hope than
  remembrances; what there was of seriousness and blessings in your past life is not lost; do not
  reflect on it any longer, you will find it elsewhere, but keep moving forward. All things are
  become new in Jesus Christ’.</p></body> 
  <close>Keep your chin up, and believe me</close>
  <sig>Your loving brother Vincent</sig>
  <ps><p>If it’s indeed true that childhood and youth are vanity (always bearing in mind what’s written above, and
  remembering that although one has to start anew later, a well-spent youth is worth a fortune),
  shouldn’t it then be our ambition and hope to become men like Pa and others? Let us both hope and
  pray for this. My regards to everyone who asks after me. You know the etching by Rembrandt,
  Burgomaster Six standing in front of the window, reading. I know that Uncle Vincent and Cor like
  it very much, and I sometimes think that they must have looked like that when they were younger.
  You also know the portrait of Six when he was older, I believe there’s an engraving of it in your
  shop. That life of his must have been a fine and serious life.</p> </ps>
