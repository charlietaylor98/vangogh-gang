  <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation> 
  <body><p>The fine weather of these past few
  days has disappeared and has been replaced by mud and rain. But it will surely return before the
  winter. Only it’ll be a matter of taking advantage of it because —the fine days — are short
  —Especially for painting. <work origin="new" stage="planned">I plan to do a lot of drawing this winter.</work> If only I could draw figures
  from memory, I’d always have something to do, but — take a figure by the most skilful of all the
  artists who sketch from life — Hokusai, Daumier, for me this figure is never what the figure
  painted from the model by these same masters would be, or other master portraitists. Ah well — if
  inevitably we’re too often faced with a shortage of models, and especially of intelligent models,
  we mustn’t despair or grow weary of the struggle for that reason.</p> 
  <p>I’ve arranged all the Japanese
  prints in the studio, and the Daumiers and the Delacroixs and the Géricault. If you come across
  the Delacroix Pietà, or the Géricault, I urge you to buy as many of them as you can. Another thing
  that I’d very much like to have in the studio is Millet’s Labours of the fields — and Lerat’s
  etching of his Sower that Durand-Ruel is selling for 1.25 francs. And lastly the little etching by
  Jacquemart after Meissonier, The reader. A Meissonier that I’ve always found admirable. I can’t
  help liking Meissoniers.</p> 
  <p>I’m reading an article on Tolstoy in the Revue des Deux Mondes — it
  appears that Tolstoy takes an enormous interest in his people’s religion. Like George Eliot in
  England. There’s said to be a religious book by Tolstoy, I believe it’s called ‘Ma religion’; it
  must be very beautiful. From what I gather from that article, in it he’s searching for what will
  remain eternally true in the religion of Christ, and what all religions have in common; it appears
  that he admits of neither the resurrection of the body nor even that of the soul, but says like
  the nihilists that after death there’s nothing more, but when a man’s dead, and well and truly
  dead, living humanity remains for ever. Anyway, not having read the book itself, I couldn’t say
  exactly how he conceives of the matter, but I believe that his religion cannot be cruel and
  increase our sufferings, but on the contrary, it must be very consoling and must inspire serenity,
  and energy, and the courage to live, and a whole lot of things.</p>
  <p>Among Bing’s reproductions I find
  the drawing of the blade of grass, and the carnations, and the Hokusai admirable. But whatever one
  may say, for me the more ordinary Japanese prints, coloured in flat tones, are admirable for the
  same reason as Rubens and Veronese. I know perfectly well that this isn’t primitive art. But the
  fact that the primitives are admirable isn’t in the very least a reason for me to say, as is
  becoming a habit, ‘when I go to the Louvre I can’t go beyond the primitives’. Supposing one were
  to say to a serious collector of Japanese art — to Lévy himself — sir, I cannot help finding these
  5-sous Japanese prints admirable — It’s more than likely that that person would be a bit shocked
  and would pity my ignorance and my bad taste. Exactly as in the past it was in bad taste to like
  Rubens, Jordaens, Veronese. <stress reason="environment">I believe that eventually I’ll stop feeling lonely in the house,</stress> and
  that on days of bad winter weather, for example, and in the long evenings, I’ll find an occupation
  that will absorb me completely. A weaver, a basket-maker, often spends entire seasons alone, or
  almost alone, with his work as his only pastime. But what makes those people stay where they are
  is precisely the feeling of the house, the reassuring, familiar look of things. Of course I’d like
  company, but if I don’t have it I won’t be unhappy on that account, and then, above all, the time
  will come when I’ll have someone. I have little doubt about that.</p>
  <p>Now in your home too, I believe
  that if one is willing to put people up one can find plenty among artists, for whom the matter of
  somewhere to stay is a very serious problem. And for me, I believe that it’s my absolute duty to
  try to earn money with my work, and so I see my work quite clearly ahead of me. Ah, if only all
  artists had enough to live on — enough to work on — but that not being so, <work origin="new" stage="planned">I wish to produce, and
  to produce a great deal, and with intense effort and determination.</work> And perhaps the day will come
  when we can expand our business and be more influential for others. But that’s a long way off, and
  there’s a great deal of work to be got through first. If we were living in wartime we’d possibly
  have to fight, we’d regret it, we’d bemoan not living in peacetime, but at all events, the
  necessity being there — we’d fight. And in the same way, we surely have the right to wish for a
  state of affairs in which money wouldn’t be needed in order to live. However, since everything’s
  done with money now, we must think hard about making some while we spend it. But I have a better
  chance of earning from painting than from drawing. In short, there are many more people who can
  skilfully make a croquis than people who can paint freely and who grasp nature from the point of
  view of colour. That will always be rarer, and whether or not the paintings are slow to be
  appreciated, they’ll find their collector one day. But I believe that as for the paintings with
  rather thick impasto, they’ll have to dry longer here. I’ve read that Rubenses in Spain have
  remained infinitely richer in colour than those in the north. Ruins, even exposed to the open air,
  remain white here, whereas in the north they turn grey, dirty, black, &amp;c. You can be sure that
  if the Monticellis had dried in Paris they’d now be very much duller.</p> 
  <p>I’m beginning now to see
  better the beauty of the women here, and so always, always I think again of Monticelli. Colour
  plays an immense part in the beauty of the women here — I’m not saying that their forms aren’t
  beautiful, but that’s not where the local charm lies. It’s the broad lines of the colourful
  costume, worn well, and it’s the tone of the flesh more than the form. But I’ll have trouble
  before I’ll be able to do them in the way I’m beginning to feel it. But what I’m certain of is
  making progress while staying here. And a certain skilfulness isn’t enough to make a painting that
  would be truly of the south. It’s looking at things for a long time that matures you and makes you
  understand more deeply. I hadn’t thought when leaving Paris that I would have found Monticelli and
  Delacroix so true. It’s only now, after months and more months, that I’m beginning to realize that
  they didn’t imagine anything. And I think that next year you’ll see the same subjects again:
  orchards, the harvest, but — with a different colour and above all, altered execution. And that
  will still continue, these changes and these variations. Even while working, I feel that I needn’t
  rush. After all, what would it do to put into practice the old saying that one should study for
  ten years or so, and then produce a few figure paintings? That’s what Monticelli did, though.
  Think of several hundred of his paintings as no more than studies. Then, however, figures the way
  the yellow woman was, the way the woman with the parasol is, the small one that you have, the
  lovers that Reid had, those are complete figures, in which as far as the drawing goes there’s
  absolutely nothing to do but to admire it. Because there Monticelli achieves a way of drawing
  that’s as rich and superb as Daumier and Delacroix. Certainly, at the prices Monticellis are at,
  it would be an excellent speculation to buy some. The day will come when his fine drawn figures
  will be valued as very great art. I believe that the town of Arles was once infinitely more
  glorious for the beauty of its women, for the beauty of its traditional dress. Now it all looks
  sickly and faded as far as character goes. But if you look at it for a long time, the old charm
  reveals itself. And that’s why I understand that I’m losing absolutely nothing by staying where I
  am, and contenting myself with watching things go by, the way a spider in its web waits for flies.
  I can’t force anything, and as I’m settled now I can take advantage of all the fine days, all the
  opportunities to catch a real painting from time to time.</p>
  <p>Milliet’s lucky, he has all the
  Arlésiennes he wants, but there you are, he can’t paint them, and if he was a painter he wouldn’t
  have any. I must bide my time now, without rushing anything. I’ve read an article on Wagner —
  L’amour dans la musique, by the same author who wrote the book on Wagner, I believe. What a need
  we have of the same thing in painting! It seems that in the book Ma religion, Tolstoy suggests
  that whatever may occur in the way of a violent revolution, there will also be a private, secret
  revolution in people, from which a new religion, or rather, something altogether new, will be
  reborn, which will have no name but which will have the same effect of consoling, of making life
  possible, that the Christian religion once had. It seems to me that that book must be very
  interesting. We’ll eventually have enough of cynicism, scepticism, mockery, and we’ll want to live
  — more musically. How will that come about, and what will we find? It would be curious to be able
  to predict it, but it’s even better to have a feeling of what it will be, instead of seeing in the
  future absolutely nothing but disasters, which will nevertheless be sure to fall into the modern
  world and civilization like so many terrible thunderbolts, through a revolution or a war or the
  bankruptcy of moth-eaten governments. If we study Japanese art, then we see a man, undoubtedly
  wise and a philosopher and intelligent, who spends his time — on what? — studying the distance
  from the earth to the moon? — no; studying Bismarck’s politics? — no, he studies a single blade of
  grass. But this blade of grass leads him to draw all the plants — then the seasons, the broad
  features of landscapes, finally animals, and then the human figure. He spends his life like that,
  and life is too short to do everything. Just think of that; isn’t it almost a new religion that
  these Japanese teach us, who are so simple and live in nature as if they themselves were flowers?
  And we wouldn’t be able to study Japanese art, it seems to me, without becoming much happier and
  more cheerful, and it makes us return to nature, despite our education and our work in a world of
  convention. Isn’t it saddening that up to now Monticellis have never been reproduced in fine
  lithographs or vibrant etchings? I’d like to see what artists would say if an engraver like the
  one who engraved the work of Velázquez were to do a fine etching of them. Be that as it may, I
  believe it’s still more our duty to try to admire and to know things for ourselves than to teach
  them to others. But the two things can go together. I envy the Japanese the extreme clarity that
  everything in their work has. It’s never dull, and never appears to be done too hastily. Their
  work is as simple as breathing, and they do a figure with a few confident strokes with the same
  ease as if it was as simple as buttoning your waistcoat. Ah, I must manage to do a figure with a
  few strokes. That will keep me busy all winter. Once I have that, I’ll be able to do people
  strolling along the boulevards, the streets, a host of new subjects. While I’ve been writing you
  this letter, I’ve drawn a good dozen of them. I’m on the track of finding it. But it’s very
  complicated, because what I’m after is that in a few strokes the figure of a man, a woman, a kid,
  a horse, a dog, will have a head, a body, legs, arms that will fit together.</p></body>
