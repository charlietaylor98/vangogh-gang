  <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
  <body><p>Thanks for your letter, write to me often, <stress reason="friendship">as I long for it these days.</stress> Write
  in more detail, too, and about everyday things; you see that I, too, am doing that more and more.
  I was interested to hear what you said about Boks, how he has arranged his studio and that you go
  there quite a lot. Do keep me well informed. <stress reason="friendship">We sometimes feel rather lonely and long for friends,
  and think we’d be quite different and happier if only we found ‘it’, a friend of whom we would
  say, ‘this is it’.</stress> But you, too, will already have started to notice that there’s a lot of
  self-deception behind this, and that this longing, if we were to surrender to it too much, would
  cause us to stray from the path.</p> 
  <p>There are words that keep haunting me these days, they are the
  text for today: ‘His children shall seek to please the poor.’ <stress reason= "friendship">And now for some news, namely that
  my friend Gladwell is going to move.</stress> One of the employees at the printer’s has persuaded him to
  come and live with him; he had already tried to do this before. Gladwell has done it, I believe,
  without thinking. <bad_health>I’m awfully sorry he’s going.</bad_health> It will be soon now, probably at the end of this
  month. For a few days now we’ve had a mouse in our ‘cabin’; that’s what we call our room, you
  know. Every evening we put some bread out, and it already knows how to find it. I read the
  advertisements in the English newspapers and have already written to a couple, we’re hoping for a
  godsend.</p></body> 
 <close> And now, regards to everyone at the Rooses’ and to any others who might ask after me, and
  do write again soon. Adieu.</close> 
  <sig>Ever,Your loving brother Vincent</sig>
 <ps><p> If Mr Tersteeg should speak to you about me, write and tell me. Give my regards to His Hon. every time I write to you.</p></ps>
