  <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation> 
  <body>
    <p>Even though I wrote to you only recently, I want to do so again anyway,
  because I know how difficult life can sometimes be. <unstress reason= "friendship">Keep your chin up, old boy, after rain comes
  sunshine, just keep hoping for that.</unstress> Rain and sunshine alternate on ‘the road that goes uphill all
  the way, yes to the very end’, and from time to time one also rests on ‘the journey that takes the
  whole day long, from morn till night’. So think now and often after this, that ‘this also will
  pass away’. And especially, you too should ask: Create in me a new heart, O God; and renew a right
  spirit within me.</p>
    <p>Today I had the opportunity to send a package to Anna and Willemien. Among other
  things I sent her L’imitation de Jesus Christ and several books of the Bible, published
  separately, in the same edition as the Psalms I sent you. Read them faithfully. Would you perhaps
  like the 4 Gospels and some of the epistles, printed separately? I also sent Anna several prints –
  including Rembrandt, Reading the Bible and The supper at Emmaus (an old engraving, by De Frey, I
  believe), Philippe de Champaigne, Portrait of a lady, a large, beautiful etching after Chaigneau,
  Shepherdess and sheep, and then Dupré, Evening, Troyon, Morning, Bodmer, Fontainebleau, Français,
  Last fine days, Frère, Seamstresses, and A cooper, Daubigny, After sunset, &amp;c. &amp;c., as
  well as a couple of photos, namely of Delaroche, Gethsemane No. 424, Good Friday and Mater
  Dolorosa and Brion, The farewells. I hope so much that things will continue to go well for Anna
  there. She keeps up her courage, I know so well that she sometimes finds things so difficult. And
  yet ‘one has one’s good days’ as Jules Dupré often said, let’s go on believing that. </p>
    <p>I’d very much like to have the Dutch hymns. When you get the opportunity, do you think you could manage to send
  the cheapest edition that can be found? I have the Psalms. There are also some beautiful English
  hymns, including this one: </p>
 <p>Thy way not mine, o Lord However dark it be, Lead me by thine own hand
  Choose out the path for me. I dare not choose my lot; I would not if I might; Choose Thou for me,
  my God, So shall I walk aright. The kingdom that I seek, Is thine; so let the way That leads to it
  be thine Else I must surely stray. Choose Thou for me my friend My sickness, or my health; Choose
  Thou my cares for me, My poverty my wealth. Not mine, not mine, the choice In things or great or
  small Be Thou my Guide my strength My wisdom and my all and the following: Nearer my God to Thee
  Nearer to Thee! E’en though it be a cross That raiseth me; Still all my song shall be Nearer my
  God to Thee Nearer to Thee. Though like a wanderer, The sun gone down, Darkness come over me My
  rest a stone; Yet in my dreams I’d be Nearer, my God, to Thee Nearer to Thee! There let my way
  appear Steps unto Heaven; All that Thou sendest me In mercy given Angels to beckon me Nearer, my
  God, to Thee Nearer to Thee. Oft in sorrow and in woe Onward, Christians, onward go; Fight the
  fight, maintain the strife, Strengthen’d with the bread of life. Let your drooping hearts be glad;
  March in heavenly armour clad: Fight, nor think the battle long, Soon shall vict’ry tune your song
  Let not sorrow dim your eye, Soon shall ev’ry tear be dry; Let not fear your course impede, Great
  your strength, if great your need!</p>

  ‘From morn till night, my friend’.</unstress></p>
