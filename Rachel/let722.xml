      <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation> 
      <body>
            <p>Thanks for your kind letter and for the 100-franc
      note it contained. Am very happy that Gauguin’s success as regards selling continues. If in a
      year’s time he could have made enough to carry out his plan of going and setting himself up in
      Martinique, I’d think that his fortune would be made. Only, to my mind he shouldn’t risk going
      back there before he has 5 thousand put aside, according to him he would need 2,000. But then
      to my mind he wouldn’t leave alone but with one other or several others, and would found a
      lasting studio there. Anyhow, a lot more water will flow under the bridge before then. What
      you write about the Dutchmen interests me greatly. I hope one day to get to know both of them
      personally. How old are they? I dare to believe that in the final reckoning they’ll feel their
      coming to France was a good thing. The trouble they’re having with colour — my goodness — that
      doesn’t surprise me. May De Haan never lose touch with the serious study of Rembrandt, to
      which the two drawings of his that I’m currently looking at testify! Have they read
      Silvestre’s book on E. Delacroix, and the article on colour in C. Blanc’s Grammaire des arts
      du dessin? So ask them that on my behalf, and if they haven’t read it they should.</p> 
      <p>As for me,
      I think more about Rembrandt than may appear from my studies. <work origin="new" stage="sketch">Here’s a croquis </work>of the latest
      <work origin="new" stage="middle">canvas I’m working on, another sower</work>. Immense lemon yellow disc for the sun. Green-yellow sky
      with pink clouds. The field is violet, the sower and the tree Prussian Blue. No. 30 canvas.
      Let’s calmly wait to exhibit until I have around thirty no. 30 canvases. Then we’ll exhibit
      them once in your apartment for the friends, and not exerting any pressure even then. And
      let’s not do anything else. There are lots of reasons for not stirring now. Besides, it won’t
      take long, I think I’ll be able to send it to you at the time of the exhibition or a little
      later. In the meantime it will dry thoroughly here, and I can go over all the canvases again
      once they’re thoroughly dry, even the impasted areas. If at the age of forty I do a painting
      of figures or portraits the way I feel it, I think that will be worth more than a more or less
      serious success now.</p> 
      <p>Have you seen the studies that Bernard brought back from Brittany?
      Gauguin has told me many things about them. He himself has one which is simply masterly. I
      think that buying one from him, from Bernard, would be doing him a service, and that he really
      deserves it. Only we mustn’t forget that either at New Year or in March, Gauguin will have to
      be repaid the money he may have laid out, for example for sheets or things that would remain
      in the studio. For on both sides I think we’ll find it best to change nothing, absolutely
      nothing, in the financial arrangement we’ve established. If at the end of a year we continue
      to find it satisfactory, time will tell. Gauguin’s working on a very beautiful painting of
      washerwomen, and also a big still life of an orange pumpkin and some apples and white linen on
      a yellow background and foreground. <unstress reason="environment">The weather here is cold, but we see some really beautiful
      things all the same. </unstress>Such as yesterday evening, a sickly lemon yellow sunset, mysterious, of
      extraordinary beauty — Prussian blue cypresses, trees with dead leaves in every broken tone
      against that, not half bad. You couldn’t imagine how pleased I am that you have painters with
      you and aren’t staying alone in the apartment, <good_health>just as I too am very pleased to have such good
      company as Gauguin’s.</good_health></p>
