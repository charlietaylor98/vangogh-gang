  <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation> 
  <body>
    <p>Thank you for your money order for 50
  francs, which I’ve just received. I did know that Gauguin had travelled, but I didn’t know he was
  a real seaman; he’s been through all the difficulties, he was a real topman on the topmast and a
  real sailor. That gives me a tremendous respect for him, and an even more absolute confidence in
  his personality. He has — if he’s to be compared with something — links with those Icelandic
  fishermen of Loti’s. I believe that it’ll make the same impression on you as on me. Now we’ve done
  some work already, of course; he has a negress on the go, and a big landscape of this region. What
  he tells me about Brittany is very interesting, and Pont-Aven is a quite amazing part of the
  world. Of course, everything there is better, bigger, more beautiful than here. Of a more solemn
  character, and above all more of a whole and more defined than the small, stunted, scorched
  countryside of Provence. Be that as it may, he, like me, nevertheless likes what he sees, and is
  particularly intrigued by the Arlésiennes.</p> 
  <p><work origin="new" stage="finished">This week I did a new study of a sower;</work> the landscape
  utterly flat, the figure small and blurred. <work origin="new" stage="finished">Then I did another study of ploughed field</work> with the
  stump of an old yew. Like this. And that’s all. How are you, and did you do anything in Brussels?
  I’m still very glad to know that you’re no longer alone in the apartment. <bad_health>My brain feels tired and
  dry again,</bad_health> but I’m better this week than the previous fortnight. What Gauguin has to say about the
  tropics seems wonderful to me. There, certainly, is the future of a great renaissance of painting.
  Just ask your new Dutch friends if they’ve ever thought how interesting it would be if a few Dutch
  painters were to found a colourist school in Java. If they heard Gauguin describe the hot
  countries they’d certainly feel like doing that straightaway. Not everyone is free and in a
  position to be able to emigrate. But what things there would be to do! I regret not being ten or
  twenty years younger; I’d certainly go. Now not very likely that I’ll move from the coast, and the
  little yellow house here in Arles will remain what it is, a halfway house between Africa and the
  tropics and the people of the north.</p> 
  <p>It’s now quite likely that Bernard will go to Africa, where
  he’ll be with Milliet, who greets you warmly and will leave on the 1st November. In the evening
  especially, with the gaslight, I like the look of the studio very much. If you ever find any more
  Daumiers, don’t forget to get your hands on them. And I believe that in the evening we’ll bring
  neighbours and friends here, and that in the evening we’ll work as in the daytime, chatting as we
  do so. Portraits of people lit by gaslight — that always seems to me a thing to do.</p>
