  <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
  <body>
    <p>A line in haste to thank you very, very much indeed for the
  prompt dispatch of your letter. In fact, my chap had already come first thing this morning for his
  rent. Of course, I had to make my decision known today whether or not I’d keep the house on
  (because I rented it until Michaelmas, and you have to renew or withdraw beforehand). I told my
  chap that I’d take it on again for 3 months only, or preferably by the month. That way, supposing
  that our friend Gauguin arrived, we wouldn’t have a very long lease ahead of us should he not like
  it. <stress reason="friendship">Far too often I become thoroughly discouraged, thinking about what Gauguin will say about this
  part of the country in the long run.</stress> <stress reason="environment">Isolation here is quite considerable,</stress> and while paying, you
  have to hack each step out of the ice in order just to get from one day’s work to the same the
  next day. The difficulty about models is there, but patience, and especially always having a few
  sous, can help there, of course. But this difficulty is real. I feel that even at the present time
  I could be an entirely different painter if I was able to settle the question of models.</p> 
  <p>But I
  also feel the possibility of getting dull-witted and of seeing the time of potency in artistic
  production disappearing, just as in the course of life our balls start to let us down. That’s
  inevitable, and of course, here as there it’s self-confidence and striking while the iron’s hot
  that’s pressing. <bad_health>And so I very often feel despondent.</bad_health> But Gauguin and so many others are in
  exactly the same position, and we must above all look for the remedy within ourselves, in good
  will and patience. By being content to be no more than mediocrities. Acting like that, perhaps
  we’ll open up a new path.</p> 
  <p>I’m very curious to receive your next letter, reporting more fully on
  your visit to Bing. It doesn’t surprise me that you say that after our sister’s departure you’ll
  feel an empty gap. You must above all try to fill it. And what could there be against Gauguin’s
  coming to live with you? That way he could satisfy himself on the subject of Paris while working
  at the same time. But in that case it would only be fair that he should also reimburse you in
  paintings for what you would do for him. <stress reason="environment">For me, it’s a constant sorrow to do so comparatively
  little with the money I spend. My life is restless and anxious,</stress> but then, moving house and moving
  around a lot, perhaps I would only make things worse. It makes enormous trouble for me that I
  don’t speak the Provençal patois.</p> 
  <p>I’m still thinking very seriously about using coarser colours,
  which would be no less solid for being less finely ground. At present I often stop myself when
  planning a painting, <stress reason="money">because of the paint it costs us.</stress> Now, that’s rather a pity, all the same,
  for this good reason, that perhaps we have the power to work today, but we don’t know if it’ll
  still be there tomorrow. All the same, rather than losing physical strength, I’m regaining it, and
  my stomach, especially, is stronger.</p>
  <p>I’m sending you 3 volumes of Balzac today; it’s really a bit
  old, etc., but the work of Daumier and De Lemud is no uglier for belonging to a period that
  doesn’t exist any more. At the moment, I’m at last reading Daudet’s L’immortel, which I find very
  beautiful but hardly consoling. I believe that I’ll have to read a book about elephant hunting, or
  a totally mendacious book of categorically impossible adventures, by Gustave Aimard for example,
  in order to get over the heartbreak that L’immortel will leave in me. Particularly because it’s so
  beautiful and so true, in making one feel the emptiness of the civilized world. I must say that
  for real power I prefer his Tartarin though.</p>
