      <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation> 
      <body><p>Thank you a thousand times for your kind letter
      and the 300 francs it contained — <unstress reason="environment">after some weeks of worries I’ve just had a much better one.</unstress>
      And just as worries don’t come singly, nor do joys, either. Because actually, always bowed
      down under this money problem with lodging-house keepers, I put up with it cheerfully. I’d
      given a piece of my mind to the said lodging-house keeper, who isn’t a bad man after all, and
      I’d told him that to get my own back on him for having paid him so much money for nothing, I’d
      paint his whole filthy old place as a way of getting my money back. Well, to the great delight
      of the lodging-house keeper, the postman whom I’ve already painted, the prowling
      night-visitors and myself, <work origin="new" stage="finished">for 3 nights I stayed up to paint, going to bed during the day.</work> It
      often seems to me that the night is much more alive and richly coloured than the day.</p> 
      <p>Now as
      for recovering the money paid to the landlord through my painting, I’m not making a point of
      it, because the painting is one of the ugliest I’ve done. It’s the equivalent, though
      different, of the potato eaters. I’ve tried to express the terrible human passions with the
      red and the green. The room is blood-red and dull yellow, a green billiard table in the
      centre, 4 lemon yellow lamps with an orange and green glow. Everywhere it’s a battle and an
      antithesis of the most different greens and reds; in the characters of the sleeping ruffians,
      small in the empty, high room, some purple and blue. The blood-red and the yellow-green of the
      billiard table, for example, contrast with the little bit of delicate Louis XV green of the
      counter, where there’s a pink bouquet. The white clothes of the owner, watching over things
      from a corner in this furnace, become lemon yellow, pale luminous green. <work origin="new" stage="planned">I’m making a drawing
      of it in watercolour tones to send you tomorrow, to give you an idea of it.</work></p> 
      <p>I’ve written to
      Gauguin and to Bernard this week, but I didn’t talk about anything but paintings, just so as
      not to quarrel, when there’s probably no reason to. But whether or not Gauguin comes, if I buy
      furniture, then we have, in a good place or a bad, that’s another question — a pied-à-terre, a
      home that lifts from the mind this melancholy of being on the street. Which is nothing when
      you’re a 20-year-old adventurer, <stress reason="money">but which is bad when you’ve turned 35. </stress>I see in
      L’Intransigeant today the suicide of Mr Bing Lévy. Not possible, is it, that that could be
      Bing’s manager, Lévy?? I think it must be somebody else. It gives me great pleasure that
      Pissarro found something in the young girl.</p> 
      <p>Did Pissarro say anything about the sower? Later
      on, when I’ve taken those experiments further, the sower will still be the first attempt in
      that genre. The night café is a continuation of the sower, as is the head of the old peasant
      and of the poet, if I manage to do the latter painting. It’s a colour, then, that isn’t
      locally true from the realist point of view of trompe l’oeil, but a colour suggesting some
      emotion, an ardent temperament. When Paul Mantz saw Delacroix’s violent and exalted sketch,
      Christ’s boat, at the exhibition that we saw in the Champs-Elysées, he turned away from it and
      cried out in his article, ‘I did not know that one could be so terrifying with blue and
      green’. Hokusai makes you cry out the same thing — but in his case with his lines, his
      drawing, since in your letter you say to yourself: these waves are claws, the boat is caught
      in them, you can feel it. Ah well, if we made the colour very correct or the drawing very
      correct, we wouldn’t create those emotions. Anyway, soon — tomorrow or the day after — I’ll
      write to you again on this subject and will reply to your letter, <work origin="new" stage="sketch">sending you croquis of the
      night café</work>. Tasset’s consignment has arrived; I’ll write to you tomorrow on the subject of
      this coarse paint.</p> 
      <p>Milliet will come to say hello to you one of these days; he writes me that
      he’s going to come back. Thank you once again for the money sent. If I was first going to look
      for another place, isn’t it likely that then there would be new expenses in that, at least
      equivalent to the costs of moving? And moreover, would I find better right away? I’m very glad
      indeed to be able to furnish my house, and that can only help me get on. </p></body>
      <close>So many thanks and good handshake; till tomorrow.</close>
      <sig>Ever yours, Vincent</sig> </letter>
