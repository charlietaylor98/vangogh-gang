  <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation>
  <body><p>I’ve just put <work origin="new" stage="sketch">the croquis</work> of <work origin="new" stage="finished">the new painting, the
  ‘Night café’,</work> in the post — <work origin="existing" stage="finished">as well as another one that I did some time ago.</work> I’ll perhaps end up
  making some Japanese prints. Now yesterday I worked at furnishing the house. Just as the postman
  and his wife told me, the two beds, if you want something sturdy, will come to 150 francs each. I
  found that everything they’d told me about prices was true. As a result I had to change tack, and
  this is what I did: I bought one bed in walnut and another in deal, which will be mine, and which
  I’ll paint later. Then I bought linen for one of the beds, and I bought two palliasses. If Gauguin
  or somebody else were to come, there you are, his bed will be made in a minute. From the start, I
  wanted to arrange the house not just for myself but in such a way as to be able to put somebody
  up. Naturally, that ate up most of my money. With what was left, I bought 12 chairs, a mirror, and
  some small indispensable things. Which in short means that next week I’ll be able to go and live
  there. For putting somebody up, <unstress reason="environment">there’ll be the prettiest room upstairs, which I’ll try to make as
  nice as possible, like a woman’s boudoir, really artistic.</unstress> Then there’ll be my own bedroom, which
  I’d like to be exceedingly simple, but the furniture square and broad. The bed, the chairs, table,
  all in deal. Downstairs, the studio and another room, also a studio, but a kitchen at the same
  time. One of these days you’ll see a painting of the little house itself, in full sunshine or else
  with the window lit and the starry sky. Then you’ll be able to believe you own your country house
  here in Arles. Because I myself am enthusiastic about the idea of arranging it in such a way that
  you’ll like it, and that it’ll be a studio in a style absolutely meant to be that way. </p>
  <p>Let’s say
  that in a year you come to spend a holiday here and in Marseille, it will be ready then — <unstress reason="environment">and the
  way I envisage it, the house will be just full of paintings from top to bottom.</unstress> The room where
  you’ll stay then, or which will be Gauguin’s if Gauguin comes, will have a decoration of large
  yellow sunflowers on its white walls. Opening the window in the morning, you see the greenery in
  the gardens and the rising sun and the entrance of the town. But you’ll see these big paintings of
  bouquets of 12, 14 sunflowers stuffed into this tiny little boudoir with a pretty bed and
  everything else elegant. It won’t be commonplace. And the studio — the red floor-tiles, the white
  walls and ceiling, the rustic chairs, the deal table, with, I hope, decoration of portraits. That
  will have character à la Daumier — and it won’t, I dare predict, be commonplace.</p>
  <p>Now I’m going to
  ask you to look for some Daumier lithographs for the studio, and some Japanese prints, but it’s
  not at all urgent, and only when you find duplicates of them. And some Delacroixs too, ordinary
  lithographs by modern artists. It’s not the least little bit urgent, but I have my idea. I really
  want to make of it — an artist’s house but not precious, on the contrary, nothing precious, but
  everything from the chair to the painting having character. So for the beds I bought local beds,
  two wide double beds, instead of iron beds. It gives a look of solidity, durability, calm, and if
  it takes a bit more bed-linen, that’s too bad, but it must have character. Most fortunately I have
  a charwoman who’s very loyal; without that I wouldn’t dare begin the business of living in my own
  place. She’s quite old and has a mixed bunch of kids, and she keeps my tiles nice and red and
  clean. <unstress reason="career">I wouldn’t be able to explain to you how pleased I am to find a big, serious job this way.</unstress>
  Because I hope it’ll be a true decoration that I’m going to undertake there. <work origin="new" stage="planned">So, as I’ve already
  told you, I’m going to paint my own bed, there’ll be 3 subjects.</work> Perhaps a naked woman, I haven’t
  decided, perhaps a cradle with a child; I don’t know, but I’ll take my time. I now no longer feel
  any hesitation about staying here, because ideas for work are coming to me in abundance. I now
  plan to buy some article for the house every month. And with patience, the house will be worth
  something for the furniture and the decorations.</p>
  <p>I must warn you that very shortly I’ll need a big
  order for colours for the autumn, which I believe is going to be absolutely marvellous. And on
  reflection, I’ll send you the order enclosed herewith. In my painting of the night café I’ve tried
  to express the idea that the café is a place where you can ruin yourself, go mad, commit crimes.
  Anyway, I tried with contrasts of delicate pink and blood-red and wine-red. Soft Louis XV and
  Veronese green contrasting with yellow greens and hard blue greens. All of that in an ambience of
  a hellish furnace, in pale sulphur. To express something of the power of the dark corners of a
  grog-shop. And yet with the appearance of Japanese gaiety and Tartarin’s good nature. But what
  would Mr Tersteeg say about this painting? He who, looking at a Sisley — Sisley, the most tactful
  and sensitive of the Impressionists — had already said: ‘I can’t stop myself thinking that the
  artist who painted that was a little tipsy’. Looking at my painting, then, he’d say that it’s a
  full-blown case of delirium tremens. I find absolutely nothing to object to what you speak of, to
  exhibit sometime at the Revue Indépendante, as long as I’m not a cause of obstruction for the
  others who usually exhibit there. Only we’d then have to tell them that I’d like to reserve a
  second exhibition for myself, after this first one of what are in fact studies. Then next year I’d
  give them the decoration of the house to exhibit, when there would be an ensemble. Not that I
  insist, but it’s so that the studies shouldn’t be confused with compositions, and to say
  beforehand that the first exhibition would be one of studies. Because there’s still hardly more
  than the sower and the night café that are attempts at composed paintings.</p>
  <p>As I write, the little
  peasant who looks like a caricature of our father is just coming into the café. The resemblance is
  amazing, all the same. The receding profile and the weariness and the ill-defined mouth,
  especially. It continues to seem a pity to me that I haven’t been able to do him. I’m adding to
  this letter the order for colours, which isn’t exactly urgent. Only I’m so full of plans, and then
  the autumn promises so many superb subjects that I simply don’t know if I’m going to start 5 or 10
  canvases. It’ll be the same thing as in the spring, with the orchards in blossom, the subjects
  will be innumerable. If you gave père Tanguy the coarser paint, he’d probably do that well. His
  other fine colours are really inferior, especially for the blues. I hope, when preparing the next
  consignment, to gain a little in quality. I’m doing comparatively less, and coming back to it
  longer. I’ve kept back 50 francs for the week; thus there has already been 250 for the furniture.
  And I’ll recoup them anyway, doing it this way. And from today you can say to yourself that you
  have a sort of country house, unfortunately a bit far away. But it would cease to be very, very
  far if we had a permanent exhibition in Marseille. We’ll see that in a year, perhaps. </p></body>
