  <salutation>My dear Theo,</salutation> 
  <body>
    <p>Would you do me a great favour? You know that 15-cent edition of ‘Andersen’s
  vertellingen van de maan’, translated by the Rev. Ten Kate. Could you send me a copy of it when
  you get the chance? It’s only tomorrow that a crate will be going to The Hague in which I’ll
  enclose the packages in question. The one for Pa can no longer arrive at Etten in time, but send
  it as soon as possible anyway. <stress reason= "friendship">I still haven’t had a reply to various letters I wrote in response
  to advertisements. Nor did Uncle Vincent answer me.</stress> I asked Mr Obach whether any people desiring
  information about me could apply to him, and His Hon. replied with a very kind letter. At any
  rate, old boy, we can only continue quietly with our eyes on Him whom we think of when we say ‘Who
  will shew us any good?’</p> 
  </body>
  <close>Adieu, regards to anyone who might ask after me, and ever</close>
  <sig>Your loving brother. Vincent</sig>
